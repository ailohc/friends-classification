__label__neutral also I was the point person on my companys transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
__label__neutral You mustve had your hands full.
__label__neutral That I did. That I did.
__label__neutral So lets talk a little bit about your duties.
__label__surprise My duties?  All right.
__label__neutral Now youll be heading a whole division, so youll have a lot of duties.
__label__neutral I see.
__label__neutral But therell be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.
__label__neutral Good to know.
__label__neutral We can go into detail
__label__fear No dont I beg of you!
__label__neutral All right then, well have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, youll fit in well here.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Absolutely.  You can relax; you did great.
__label__surprise But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
__label__non-neutral You know? Forget it!
__label__surprise No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
__label__non-neutral No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know
__label__neutral Ok!
__label__neutral All right, well...
__label__non-neutral I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll...
__label__non-neutral I'll see you later!
__label__neutral Yeah, sure!
__label__neutral Hey, Mon.
__label__neutral Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
__label__joy Do I ever.
__label__sadness Chris says theyre closing down the bar.
__label__surprise No way!
__label__neutral Yeah, apparently theyre turning it into some kinda coffee place.
__label__non-neutral Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
__label__sadness Got me.
__label__neutral Can I get a beer.
__label__neutral Hey, did you pick a roommate?
__label__joy You betcha!
__label__neutral Is it the Italian guy?
__label__non-neutral Um-mm, yeah right!
__label__surprise Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
__label__surprise What, what, what?!
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral He was with her when he wrote this poem.
__label__neutral Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside.
__label__neutral Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'
__label__surprise He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
__label__non-neutral You really think that is what he meant?
__label__sadness Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
__label__neutral Done.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hi!
__label__surprise What are you doing here?
__label__neutral Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Howd did it go?
__label__joy Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldnt shut up.
__label__joy Im so proud of you.
__label__joy Me too!
__label__non-neutral Listen, Im ah, Im sorry Ive been so crazy and jealous and, its just that I like you a lot, so...
__label__neutral I know.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Ameri-can.
__label__neutral Ameri-ccan.
__label__neutral Ameri-can. Y'know its a
__label__surprise Everybody!!
__label__joy Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
__label__surprise You liked it? You really liked it?
__label__joy Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
__label__neutral Which part exactly?
__label__neutral The whole thing! Can we go?
__label__non-neutral Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
__label__non-neutral I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
__label__neutral Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
__label__non-neutral I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
__label__anger You fell asleep!!
__label__anger There was no kangaroo!
__label__non-neutral They didnt take any of my suggestions!
__label__neutral Thats for coming buddy.
__label__neutral Ill see you later.
__label__sadness Dont go!
__label__sadness Im sorry.
__label__sadness Im so sorry!
__label__surprise Look!
__label__non-neutral This guy fell asleep!
__label__non-neutral He fell asleep too!
__label__anger Be mad at him!
__label__non-neutral Or, call an ambulance.
__label__neutral Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
__label__non-neutral What?! What is with everybody? Its Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
__label__neutral Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring.
__label__neutral See, if Im not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity
__label__neutral Okay, thats enough honey!
__label__neutral I dont know.  Let me see the ring.
__label__joy Great! Okay, here.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__joy Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  And
__label__neutral What've you been up to?
__label__neutral Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much.
__label__neutral Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
__label__joy Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__neutral I'm back.
__label__neutral So, are we gonna get together or what?
__label__neutral Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
__label__neutral Great, I'll see you then.
__label__joy Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
__label__neutral Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."
__label__neutral I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
__label__disgust Oh my god. You are pure evil.
__label__non-neutral Ok, pure evil , horny and alone . I've done this
__label__anger Nobody!
__label__anger Nobody respects the bucket!
__label__non-neutral You wouldn't believe what people put in here!
__label__anger Look!
__label__anger Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral This is my wedding.
__label__non-neutral All right, yknow what? We really are late! Lets go! Lets go! Lets go!!
__label__neutral Fine. Youll-youll watch it on video when we get back.
__label__joy Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__joy All right, lets go! Bye, Pheebs!
__label__joy Bye, Pheebs!
__label__joy London baby!!
__label__joy Oh, do you need a hug? You dont have to bring me anything!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__joy Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and Ill have my health insurance back in no time.
__label__non-neutral Thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now?
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral Whats wrong with you?
__label__neutral Nothing!
__label__fear Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.
__label__neutral But um, I dont think its anything serious.
__label__surprise This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor!
__label__fear No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
__label__non-neutral Thats a hernia.
__label__anger Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!
__label__joy I love your place! Where is this guy from?
__label__neutral Uh thats an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
__label__surprise Oh wow! So, youre more than just dinosaurs.
__label__neutral So much more.
__label__neutral Well, well to sum up, were having fun, you look young.
__label__neutral Okay
__label__neutral But thats not enough. So Soheres a key to my apartment.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Really.
__label__neutral You dont think this is too fast.
__label__anger Get Out!
__label__neutral Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
__label__neutral Yes, please!  So, what's going on?
__label__sadness Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
__label__surprise Oh my God, wh-what happened?
__label__sadness Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
__label__non-neutral I knew that was him!
__label__sadness Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
__label__neutral Hey, you ok?
__label__sadness I guess.
__label__neutral There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey.
__label__neutral I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else.
__label__neutral Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
__label__neutral Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
__label__neutral Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?
__label__non-neutral Or we could throw you both in
__label__anger Ok, gentlemen!
__label__anger Please!
__label__anger Aren't we a little old for this?
__label__non-neutral I mean, we're scientists, right?
__label__non-neutral We're academics.
__label__joy And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first.
__label__neutral .
__label__joy GO, GO, GO!
__label__joy Go, go, go!
__label__joy Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
__label__non-neutral Oy!!
__label__surprise Whats with all this sand?
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
__label__neutral Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
__label__anger Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
__label__joy Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
__label__neutral If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
__label__neutral Rach? What are you doing?
__label__fear Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
__label__neutral It's a diaper commercial.
__label__fear Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
__label__joy Pizza delivery!
__label__joy I'll get it! I will get that!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
__label__neutral Uhh, the ball thing.
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__joy Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
__label__neutral Uhh,
__label__joy Okay!
__label__fear Uh-oh.
__label__neutral What?
__label__non-neutral I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
__label__surprise Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
__label__fear I know!  Don't switch hands, okay?
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral How did it go with Erin?
__label__joy Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
__label__joy Yay!! Oh so, youre not, youre not mad at us anymore?
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__joy You guys were totally right!
__label__joy This is so much better than the first time we went out.
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__neutral That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
__label__neutral Didnt you sleep together?
__label__neutral Yeah, that really calms me down.
__label__non-neutral And!
__label__joy We have so much in common!
__label__non-neutral She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if we were ever to have kids, well thats a
__label__surprise Oh my God! Listen to you talkin about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please dont get married before I do.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__surprise How does she do that?
__label__neutral I cannot sleep in a public place.
__label__non-neutral Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
__label__surprise Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
__label__neutral It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
__label__surprise What's going on with you?
__label__anger I got no sleep last night!
__label__neutral Why?
__label__disgust My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed.
__label__neutral Oh, and deaf.
__label__neutral So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time.
__label__disgust You have no idea how loud they are!
__label__neutral Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
__label__joy Thanks.
__label__disgust Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
__label__neutral It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
__label__surprise Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
__label__neutral Breathe, breathe, breathe.
__label__surprise Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually going to kill you dead.
__label__non-neutral Okay! You dont think I thought of that?
__label__surprise How can you not know which one?
__label__non-neutral I mean thats unbelievable.
__label__neutral I mean, was it Gina?
__label__neutral Which one is Gina?
__label__neutral Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
__label__neutral No, no, no, thats Dina.
__label__surprise You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!!
__label__neutral I dont know, you thought See you Saturday was funny.
__label__neutral Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with.
__label__neutral You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
__label__joy Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
__label__surprise Really!?
__label__neutral Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out.
__label__neutral I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
__label__joy Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What?
__label__fear What should I wear, now Im all nervous.
__label__joy : I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
__label__joy I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
__label__joy : Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.
__label__non-neutral Oh well, okay, good luck.
__label__neutral : Yeah.
__label__neutral Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
__label__neutral : Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think Im ready to dance with girls.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral : Yeah.
__label__neutral Go get em Treeger.
__label__neutral : Right.  Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral : Yeah, you could dance real good with her, shes the same size as me.
__label__neutral No, Im good.
__label__non-neutral Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
__label__neutral Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so
__label__surprise Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
__label__neutral Who knows?
__label__neutral Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
__label__joy Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!
__label__joy Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Actually, that can't happen.
__label__neutral Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
__label__neutral So it'll be either you two  or you two.
__label__non-neutral Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
__label__neutral Yeah, it is.
__label__neutral No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
__label__non-neutral Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
__label__joy Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
__label__non-neutral Please!
__label__non-neutral Are you kidding?
__label__non-neutral I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody noseI mean I-Im not proud of it but, I really am.
__label__joy And its all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
__label__fear I think youve got concussion.
__label__joy No, no, Im serious. Thank you.
__label__fear Youre welcome.  Im sorry. Did I hurt you?
__label__non-neutral Its worth the pain.  Yknow what, you know what? Its not.
__label__surprise Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
__label__non-neutral I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do"  "I do".
__label__neutral Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
__label__joy David is going to propose to Phoebe.
__label__surprise What?  Why?
__label__non-neutral Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
__label__anger Chandler, we have talked about this.
__label__anger You are not supposed to give people advice!
__label__non-neutral Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
__label__neutral I
__label__anger They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!
__label__non-neutral She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone
__label__non-neutral Man, that's some
__label__neutral Oh, that's not what you want...
__label__neutral This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
__label__joy It-its great to meet you Paul.
__label__neutral I usually prefer Elizabeths boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
__label__neutral Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
__label__anger So Ross, what your problem?
__label__surprise Eh-whExcuse me?
__label__anger Why cant you get a girlfriend your own age?
__label__fear Thats funny. Umm.  Its not funny.
__label__neutral I
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral I can, I can see that.
__label__fear Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral What?
__label__anger Okay. Ill give you one chance to change my mind.  You got one minute.
__label__surprise Daddy!
__label__neutral Oh well, its not on TV yet.
__label__neutral Well, then its not on the wall yet.
__label__neutral Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
__label__neutral So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauers clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that havent been cleaned yet?
__label__surprise Ooooohh!
__label__neutral Oh yeah, I'm sure.  And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
__label__surprise Was it...?
__label__neutral Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
__label__surprise "Ooo," what?
__label__neutral Uma Thurman.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__surprise The actress!
__label__neutral Thanks Rach.
__label__surprise So what are you gonna do?
__label__joy You have to tell her!
__label__joy You have to tell her!
__label__non-neutral It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue!
__label__non-neutral Guys?
__label__non-neutral Guys?
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
__label__neutral Feminist issue. That's where I went!
__label__fear She is gonna hate me.
__label__neutral Yeah, well...
__label__non-neutral Will you marry me?
__label__joy Its the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
__label__neutral Yeah, right here in my pocket.  Pheebs?
__label__surprise Oh! Oop!
__label__neutral Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and shes gonna know.
__label__neutral Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
__label__neutral Hi guys.
__label__joy You are beautiful.
__label__joy Oh, thank you!   Whats going on?
__label__neutral Were just reallyvery excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
__label__neutral Okay umm, Ross?
__label__neutral I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater.
__label__neutral Now, I'm just letting you know that this is
__label__joy Yep! That's hilarious!
__label__neutral I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
__label__neutral Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
__label__neutral No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
__label__neutral Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
__label__neutral Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
__label__surprise What?! You totally get embarrassed!
__label__neutral No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
__label__neutral Is that so?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__disgust Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am
__label__surprise I cant believe it!
__label__joy I did it!
__label__joy I rode a bike!
__label__joy I never thought Id be able to do that!
__label__joy Thank you Ross.
__label__joy Oh hey, dont thank me, thank yourself. Youre the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
__label__non-neutral Well yeah, but then
__label__non-neutral YeahNo-but-but-but-but! Were just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, thats not scary right?
__label__neutral Depends on what you mean by we.
__label__neutral Hey, both you guys should be up there with me.
__label__neutral I mean, you two are-are my I mean, Im lucky to have just one good
__label__neutral Thanks man.
__label__neutral I gotta go check something over here.
__label__non-neutral What a baby.
__label__non-neutral Total wuss!
__label__neutral David?
__label__joy Phoebe! Hi!
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__joy Wow, you look unbelievable.
__label__surprise Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
__label__non-neutral Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.
__label__surprise What happened?
__label__neutral Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__sadness Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.
__label__joy Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
__label__non-neutral Good, good, life is good...
__label__joy Good!
__label__non-neutral Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
__label__neutral Oh, good for you.
__label__non-neutral She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that".
__label__sadness Mike and I broke up.
__label__sadness It means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us.
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__sadness I'm sorry.
__label__sadness I'm sorry too.
__label__non-neutral Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
__label__non-neutral I know.
__label__neutral Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
__label__joy Wow! This looks great!
__label__non-neutral Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap.  Umm, this one is made of bologna.
__label__non-neutral And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
__label__non-neutral You kissed another woman!
__label__neutral Call it even?!
__label__non-neutral Okay!
__label__neutral Well, Im gonna go get these  in some water.
__label__surprise Wait you stole those from these peoples wedding?
__label__neutral No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby.
__label__anger Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__surprise My sweater!
__label__surprise Ive been looking for this for like a month!
__label__surprise Oh my God!!
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy?
__label__anger Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be!
__label__surprise Huh?
__label__anger Because I sure as hell cant figure it out!
__label__non-neutral I talk to you and nothin.
__label__non-neutral You look at me, and its nothin.
__label__non-neutral Nothing.
__label__joy Tasty! Im really starting to feel like you guys have a history, its-its nice.
__label__neutral I have a question about this scene.
__label__neutral Yes?
__label__non-neutral Well, I dont understand why Adriennes attracted to Victor.
__label__neutral Peel the onion. First of all, hes good looking.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral I think my characters gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
__label__neutral Oh, hey, how about this one.
__label__non-neutral Ah, its says so in the script!
__label__non-neutral Y'know ah, I-I dont know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that youre a bitch.
__label__anger It doesnt say that in the script.
__label__non-neutral It does in mine!
__label__non-neutral I cant
__label__non-neutral Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
__label__neutral Yknow who has a great video camera?
__label__neutral Greg and Jenny?
__label__neutral Do you still wanna call em? I wanna call em.
__label__neutral Lets call em.
__label__joy Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
__label__neutral Hello?  Eighth street deli?
__label__disgust Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin to that place.
__label__non-neutral Uh sorry, wrong number.
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__surprise Hello?   Its the deli again!
__label__joy All right! Ill have a sandwich!
__label__non-neutral I dont think this numbers right!
__label__non-neutral Oh come on!!
__label__sadness Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
__label__surprise Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?
__label__neutral Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
__label__neutral Sure. So how long you been...
__label__neutral Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
__label__surprise Since then?!
__label__neutral No, it's only been six years.
__label__neutral I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy.
__label__neutral ...Joe.
__label__neutral Y'ever been in love?
__label__neutral ...I d'know.
__label__neutral Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
__label__disgust You're one to talk.
__label__neutral Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
__label__non-neutral Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
__label__surprise Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
__label__neutral Everythings gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
__label__surprise Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  Thats supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
__label__neutral Hey, Rach, how was work?
__label__neutral Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasnt a chair.
__label__neutral By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
__label__neutral Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming.
__label__neutral Im just gonna throw it out, its probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
__label__neutral Something wrong?
__label__neutral No. Nothing.
__label__neutral And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
__label__surprise Yeah, that's it?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy Yess!!
__label__joy We're teeth people Zack!
__label__sadness Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
__label__non-neutral No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name!
__label__neutral Its not that bad.
__label__non-neutral Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
__label__neutral So, youre just Bing?
__label__joy Because we won our apartment back!
__label__surprise What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
__label__non-neutral No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
__label__surprise I dont know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it!  Ah-ha!
__label__neutral All right, cut, lets pick again, pick again.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Come on apartment! Come on apartment!  Oh! I know queen is high!
__label__surprise Uh-huh, not as high as It worked! King!
__label__joy Yeah baby!
__label__joy But, we pick again! We pick again!
__label__neutral Why?!
__label__non-neutral I dont know!
__label__joy Tickets please!  Thats courtside baby!
__label__surprise Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
__label__non-neutral No they didnt!
__label__neutral You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
__label__neutral It's gonna be worth it.
__label__neutral It's a known fact that women love babies, all right?
__label__neutral Women love guys who love babies.
__label__neutral It's that whole sensitive thing.
__label__neutral Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there.
__label__neutral Maybe one of them will break away.
__label__non-neutral No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left.
__label__neutral All right, gimme the baby.
__label__neutral No, I got him.
__label__non-neutral No, seriously.
__label__surprise Oh, seriously you want him?
__label__neutral Hello.
__label__surprise Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
__label__neutral You wanna smell him?
__label__joy Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
__label__non-neutral What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
__label__neutral Well, we are great guys.
__label__neutral Bye.
__label__neutral Well, not really.
__label__neutral I mean technically its-its not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.
__label__non-neutral Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
__label__non-neutral Well Ross, you be careful now. You dont want to get a reputation as yknow Professor McNailshisstudents.
__label__non-neutral Yeah. What-what should I do?
__label__neutral Well Ross, it seems pretty clear.
__label__neutral I mean whats more important?
__label__neutral What people think or how you feel, huh?
__label__neutral Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
__label__joy Joey that is so sweet.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
__label__sadness I couldnt do it.
__label__surprise You couldnt do it?!
__label__neutral Hey, relax I just need more time. Were going to dinner tonight.
__label__surprise What?! Youre going out with her again!
__label__neutral Going out with who?
__label__neutral Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
__label__surprise Oh yeah! Wasnt she uh
__label__neutral No, that was Dana Caplin.
__label__surprise Joey! You didnt even know her!
__label__non-neutral Ah whatever!
__label__joy Morning! Hey, hows my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
__label__anger Dont touch him!
__label__surprise Okay!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Umm, all right Wayne, level with me.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__fear I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired.
__label__non-neutral Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part!
__label__non-neutral Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance!
__label__non-neutral I mean, I love-I love this little guy!
__label__surprise Ah-ah!!
__label__surprise Okay, thats why you didnt want me to touch him right?
__label__neutral Here you go!
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__anger Stupid!
__label__surprise I cant believe it!
__label__anger God!
__label__neutral Hey, how you doin?
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
__label__neutral No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
__label__non-neutral I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
__label__anger For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
__label__anger You had no
__label__anger Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
__label__anger But I told you, I didnt have the time!
__label__anger Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
__label__anger Wh, Ross what do you want from me?
__label__anger You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
__label__neutral I know.
__label__non-neutral Ooh, I have to tell you something.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral But I cant tell you.
__label__neutral Okay, but wouldnt it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
__label__neutral Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldnt tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
__label__neutral Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Does it have to do with Joey?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
__label__neutral No, but lets come back to that later!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Richard!
__label__neutral Actually, Im not here to complement the chef.
__label__neutral Ohh Oh, thats okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef.
__label__neutral Like I have nothing better to do!
__label__neutral So whats up?
__label__joy Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
__label__neutral Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
__label__joy No! I came here to tell you something else.  I came here  to tell you I still love you.
__label__non-neutral One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
__label__non-neutral So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
__label__anger Maybe!  Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it! I cant!
__label__fear Joey, I am scared to death about this.
__label__fear But I really think I can do it, Im just gonna need some help.
__label__neutral And Bobbys gonna be here the whole time.
__label__joy You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, were straight-up gangster rap.
__label__anger Look, Rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her. Why cant you do that for me?
__label__non-neutral Because! Cause Cause youre my baby sister!
__label__joy And youre my big brother!
__label__neutral I mean, youre my favorite guy in the whole world.
__label__neutral Im not even scared to tell mom and dad.
__label__fear I was scared of telling you.
__label__non-neutral Well Id be scared of them, but all right.
__label__sadness Joey, I cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.
__label__sadness I want him to have his uncle.
__label__sadness Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
__label__joy Of course hes gonna have his Uncle Joey!
__label__joy Were gonna be all right. I mean, even if were not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
__label__joy Thats right! By his uncle too!
__label__joy And by you.
__label__neutral Okay Bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have a little moment.
__label__non-neutral Come here!
__label__non-neutral No! Seriously! Whats wrong with you?!
__label__joy I had a really nice time tonight.
__label__joy So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
__label__neutral I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
__label__surprise You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch?  Ohhh! I saw
__label__neutral Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__surprise Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
__label__neutral Like it would help.
__label__non-neutral You are so bad!
__label__non-neutral You are!
__label__non-neutral You are!
__label__non-neutral You are!
__label__non-neutral You are!
__label__non-neutral You are!
__label__non-neutral You are!
__label__non-neutral You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
__label__neutral Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
__label__surprise Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
__label__neutral Hi Mom, it's Jill.
__label__surprise She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!
__label__neutral Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
__label__neutral Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
__label__neutral I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
__label__joy Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was
__label__non-neutral I say, Drew!
__label__neutral Are you seeing anybody right now?
__label__non-neutral Og-ee-op, Im not asking for me, Im I mean No, Im-Im not gay, Im not asking you out.
__label__non-neutral Im not-Im not-Im not gay!
__label__neutral Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__non-neutral That sounds great!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You cant eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
__label__surprise Theres gravy?
__label__neutral If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time.
__label__neutral That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, thats your department now.
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral I think I left a donut up here.
__label__neutral So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so Im happy.
__label__joy Great job team!
__label__neutral Tomorrow at 8:30.
__label__non-neutral Phil!
__label__joy Nice job.
__label__non-neutral Stevens!
__label__joy Way to go!
__label__joy Joel-burg, you maniac!
__label__joy I love ya!
__label__joy Bing!
__label__joy Good job, couldnt have done it without ya.
__label__neutral Thank you, sir.
__label__neutral Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.
__label__non-neutral Of course, you did.
__label__non-neutral Forgot something else too ya bastard!
__label__neutral Well, what about you?
__label__neutral Youre not feeling left out or anything are ya?
__label__non-neutral No. No, not at all, thats-thats ridiculous.
__label__non-neutral Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Dont you?
__label__sadness Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
__label__non-neutral Now get on out of here, you!
__label__neutral Hey Bob.
__label__joy Hey! Hows my pal Toby doing today?
__label__neutral If I see him, Ill ask.
__label__joy Toby!
__label__non-neutral Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Oh then you know each other.
__label__neutral Were on a semi-first name basis.
__label__neutral What do you think of adding him to our team?
__label__non-neutral Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know if he has what it takes.
__label__surprise Really? They love him down on six.
__label__neutral But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here.
__label__joy Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
__label__neutral A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
__label__joy No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans tux!
__label__surprise What?
__label__joy Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat Batman film he was in.
__label__anger You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James Bonds tux!
__label__neutral So?
__label__sadness SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.
__label__non-neutral Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say "I do," hes thinking, "Yeah, Id do her too!"
__label__neutral Well then we still have a problem.
__label__neutral Yeah!
__label__neutral With what?
__label__neutral Well, were trying to find someone to perform our wedding and theyre all either boring or annoying or yknow, cant stop staring at the ladies.
__label__joy Oo! You should have one of us do it!
__label__neutral Phoebe, were getting
__label__joy No! No! Its-its uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
__label__surprise Are you serious?
__label__joy Yes! A friend of mine did it and its totally legal!
__label__joy I call it!!
__label__anger What?! No! It was my idea!
__label__neutral Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
__label__anger Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
__label__neutral We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
__label__joy See, I see.... big passion in your future.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral I do.
__label__joy Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
__label__non-neutral It's never gonna happen.
__label__non-neutral Everybody knows!
__label__neutral That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why.
__label__neutral Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldnt sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
__label__neutral Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
__label__neutral Yeah, I wouldve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
__label__surprise What?!?!
__label__neutral Okay, this is what Im talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
__label__neutral You can spill. In the sink.
__label__sadness Aw, honey its not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I dont see that happening.
__label__joy I love you, too.
__label__non-neutral Aww, good.  What?
__label__sadness What? Im just said.
__label__neutral No youre not, youre wondering which cushion it is.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Are you serious?!
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__joy I would love to live with you Ross; thats-thats great! Thank you!
__label__neutral Well, Im-Im just glad I could, yknow, help you out.
__label__non-neutral Wow! Im-Im so happy for you guys.  This is so-so, not stupid.
__label__joy Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me!
__label__sadness I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.
__label__joy You just saved me!
__label__joy Youre my hero!
__label__neutral Hero, I uh, I dont knowwell, all right.
__label__joy Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
__label__non-neutral Oh please!   Youre gonna say things now, arent ya?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral No, I wont.
__label__neutral But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise.
__label__non-neutral She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!
__label__non-neutral And thats how she ended up living with me!
__label__neutral Okay, thats a lie.
__label__disgust Ugh!!
__label__neutral What happened?
__label__neutral I ended up at Ross's place.
__label__neutral Oh, I musta missed counted or something.
__label__anger Damn!
__label__non-neutral She's not there anymore.
__label__neutral Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
__label__neutral No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
__label__non-neutral ...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?
__label__joy Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
__label__neutral Lose the robe.
__label__surprise Me?
__label__joy That's great.
__label__neutral Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
__label__neutral No, no, I'm still working on mine.
__label__surprise That's it?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, it was really hard.
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
__label__non-neutral Ok, you weren't there.
__label__joy Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice!
__label__neutral Pretty nice?
__label__neutral Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
__label__neutral We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weve got a canoe.
__label__neutral Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe.
__label__non-neutral You gotta take the canoe!
__label__neutral All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
__label__anger Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
__label__non-neutral Good for you!!
__label__neutral Pheebs?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
__label__surprise One ticket to Yemen?
__label__neutral Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
__label__surprise Im sorry sir, I dont understand.
__label__neutral What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
__label__neutral Are you travelling with a child?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral All right, yknow what, shes  gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card.
__label__non-neutral Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we dont take library cards.
__label__non-neutral Whats the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
__label__neutral Okay, but this is the last time.
__label__joy With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there.
__label__joy Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hows she doing?
__label__surprise She?
__label__non-neutral Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she?
__label__neutral I dont know.  I cant tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
__label__neutral Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
__label__non-neutral Excuse me?
__label__neutral What?
__label__non-neutral Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
__label__neutral Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
__label__neutral Well sensitive is important, pick him.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__disgust Oh sure, go with the sissy.
__label__anger Jason is not a sissy!
__label__non-neutral Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesnt matter.
__label__neutral I mean, I think it wouldve happened either way.
__label__neutral I mean if you hadnt initiated it I-I-I know I wouldve.
__label__joy It was an amazing night.
__label__joy It was. It was an amazing night.
__label__non-neutral You think it looked amazing?
__label__neutral Do we have a name yet?
__label__neutral No, not yet.
__label__neutral Thats fine, for now well just call her Baby Girl Green.
__label__neutral Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
__label__joy Hello baby girl.
__label__non-neutral Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
__label__non-neutral I dont like sitting up here! Im just gonna over
__label__non-neutral No Rachel! They got here first!
__label__neutral Why is Ross doing that?
__label__fear DANGER
__label__surprise Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
__label__neutral No thats all right. Dont worry about it.
__label__disgust Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain!
__label__non-neutral Rach! Hey! Its fine! Youre at Joeys!
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Yeah! Look!
__label__non-neutral Ive never lived like this before.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__neutral All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food.
__label__neutral Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
__label__joy I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen    Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
__label__surprise Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support    you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so
__label__neutral Also so
__label__neutral Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
__label__neutral Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff!
__label__neutral OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
__label__neutral About what?
__label__neutral He's planning your birthday party.
__label__joy Oh my God! I love him!
__label__fear You'd better act surprised.
__label__neutral About what?
__label__joy My surprise party!
__label__surprise What surprise party?
__label__non-neutral Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
__label__neutral Well, he didn't tell me.
__label__neutral Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
__label__anger This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
__label__neutral No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
__label__anger Yuh-huh!
__label__non-neutral I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.
__label__non-neutral I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.
__label__surprise Looks like I was second to last.
__label__neutral Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad.
__label__neutral Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an invitation.
__label__anger Chandler! Hes your father; he should be at the wedding.
__label__disgust I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I havent seen him in years.
__label__non-neutral Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!
__label__non-neutral Well he doesnt have to know!
__label__neutral Its not like we run in the same circles.
__label__disgust I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
__label__neutral Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
__label__non-neutral Trust me, you dont want him there either.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__disgust Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
__label__neutral So what! As long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil I dont care.
__label__neutral Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
__label__neutral Hello! Whos in there?
__label__neutral How ya doin?
__label__non-neutral Who in the hell are you?
__label__neutral I guess you wouldnt believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
__label__fear No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us!
__label__non-neutral No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
__label__non-neutral Im not gonna marry Chandler!
__label__anger Not after this!
__label__neutral Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo.
__label__neutral I gotta go.
__label__non-neutral Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
__label__neutral Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral So Pheebs, what is the book about?
__label__neutral I thought you said you read it in high school.
__label__neutral Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm, what is this book about?
__label__neutral Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?
__label__neutral Y'know what, actually  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
__label__non-neutral I thought you didn't smoke.
__label__neutral Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?
__label__neutral Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?
__label__surprise And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!"
__label__neutral But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
__label__neutral We get high.
__label__neutral Oh, me too.
__label__neutral I'm kidding.
__label__non-neutral Oh, me too.
__label__non-neutral Oh, are you sure you're ok?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__sadness Does it still hurt?
__label__sadness Yeah.
__label__non-neutral What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hey, how'd it go?
__label__joy Excellent.
__label__joy We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
__label__non-neutral What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
__label__neutral You know what? You are right. I
__label__joy Good for you Pheebs!
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__neutral Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean
__label__anger This sucks! I didnt know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! Im so tired!
__label__neutral Its 6:00.
__label__neutral Yeah, well
__label__joy Hi!
__label__non-neutral Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think thats, I think thats really cool.
__label__neutral Yeah, Rach, I think youre handling that really well.
__label__neutral Handling it?
__label__non-neutral What do you mean, handling it?
__label__non-neutral Theres nothing to handle.
__label__neutral Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasnt for me and Joshua.
__label__anger Yknow, theyre not gonna get married anyway!
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral Come on!
__label__disgust They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous!
__label__non-neutral I mean, theyre gonna be engaged for like what?
__label__non-neutral A year?
__label__neutral And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what theyve done and theyre call the whole thing off.
__label__joy Im telling ya, youre gonna be dancing at my wedding before youre dancing at theres.
__label__surprise What the hell is this?!
__label__anger What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I cant use for another two months?!
__label__anger This sucks!
__label__neutral All right, whats my next present?
__label__non-neutral !
__label__neutral All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
__label__neutral Ennnh.
__label__neutral Ive got canned goods.
__label__surprise Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
__label__neutral Excellent hole, Joe.
__label__surprise Oh no! No!! My hole!!
__label__non-neutral Ow!! Ow!!!
__label__surprise What?! What?!! What is it?!
__label__neutral My drinking?
__label__neutral Oh, I mustve said that after you left.
__label__non-neutral Said what? Exactly.
__label__neutral That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge.
__label__disgust Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible person!
__label__fear Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!!
__label__anger If youre gonna get all sensitive about it!
__label__sadness I dont want to lose you.
__label__neutral What if I, create a position for you?
__label__neutral Ill make you an assistant buyer in this department.
__label__joy Say more things like that.
__label__non-neutral You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
__label__neutral Id need an expense account.
__label__joy Done!
__label__neutral And an assistant.
__label__joy Sophie, get in here!
__label__joy Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
__label__surprise Oh my!
__label__neutral They're male nurses.
__label__neutral Not in my head.
__label__joy Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
__label__non-neutral Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise What are you talking about?!
__label__non-neutral You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.
__label__neutral I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me.
__label__neutral Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
__label__neutral Umm, why don't you give
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
__label__neutral Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some
__label__neutral Yep! There's always room for
__label__neutral Joey, how do you make
__label__neutral Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh,  Grandma's chicken salad
__label__neutral Hello, this is Monica...
__label__neutral Yeah???
__label__neutral Oh...
__label__neutral Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral Okay. Lets bring it in.
__label__neutral Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__anger That almost hit me in the face.
__label__non-neutral A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so cliché. Why don't you get a magician?!
__label__neutral Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
__label__joy Oh boy, me too!
__label__neutral Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
__label__non-neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
__label__non-neutral The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
__label__joy Thats me! Come on!
__label__neutral Okay.  But wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch.
__label__neutral Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
__label__non-neutral Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
__label__neutral I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
__label__joy Hi! Nice to meet you!
__label__neutral Nice to meet you too.
__label__neutral So, are you ready to go?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral Chandler!
__label__neutral Ill be right with you.
__label__neutral Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple.
__label__neutral Y'know?
__label__neutral Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.
__label__neutral Y'know?
__label__neutral You can take it off.
__label__non-neutral Just slice that baby right off!
__label__neutral Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing?
__label__neutral Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
__label__neutral Well that's not a third nipple.
__label__surprise No?
__label__neutral First of all, it's on your ass.
__label__surprise Well then, what is it?!
__label__neutral Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
__label__neutral I'm with Hamilton!
__label__neutral He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
__label__non-neutral Umm, this is great wine.
__label__neutral Its from FranceIn EuropeWestern Europe. Yknow umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__joy Uh-hmmWait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
__label__neutral I studied for a year in Barcelona.
__label__neutral Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking
__label__joy I love hiking!
__label__joy Oh thats great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo
__label__joy I get it!
__label__surprise So? Congratulations you two, I didnt even know you got married.
__label__non-neutral Oh we-we didnt.
__label__fear No-no. We
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Um uhWere-were just having this baby together but uh, uh thats all.
__label__surprise Why?!!
__label__neutral Uh well ummwere just not in that place, yknow? But were very excited about this.
__label__neutral Oh. Well then shut me up.
__label__neutral Just tell me how.
__label__non-neutral Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.
__label__non-neutral Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
__label__neutral Let it go, Ross.
__label__neutral Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
__label__neutral Do you all promise?
__label__non-neutral Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
__label__neutral Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
__label__non-neutral You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
__label__neutral Hey, Pheebs.
__label__neutral 'Dear Ms. Buffay.
__label__neutral Thank you for calling attention to our error.
__label__neutral We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.
__label__neutral We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -
__label__neutral Bye bye.
__label__neutral Yes?
__label__neutral Whatcha doin'?
__label__neutral Ooh.
__label__neutral Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the
__label__neutral Honey, both yours.
__label__joy Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
__label__neutral Yeah? The work problem?
__label__joy Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
__label__neutral What problem did you tell him you had?
__label__neutral Oh thats not important. The point is, I reallyI think everythings gonna be okay.
__label__neutral Okay, Ive got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
__label__disgust No thanks, Mom!
__label__non-neutral Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, cause Im pregnant.
__label__non-neutral Ha-ha, its not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
__label__joy Very good,  so good.
__label__joy I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
__label__sadness Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didnt call.
__label__non-neutral I mean youd think hed be worried about me not showing up at his club.
__label__non-neutral Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
__label__non-neutral Come on! Look where you are!!
__label__neutral When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
__label__neutral Remember, a virgin for me please.
__label__neutral Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
__label__neutral Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy.
__label__neutral Well, if you think it will help.
__label__anger No!
__label__non-neutral That was a test!
__label__non-neutral In a couple of hours Im gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me!
__label__non-neutral And then after that, Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice
__label__non-neutral You should! How is she?
__label__anger Ohhh!!
__label__joy I think somebody needs another lap dance.
__label__neutral All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
__label__surprise You do?
__label__surprise You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman.
__label__non-neutral That and arrogance.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__joy Hey! How was sailing?
__label__joy Wow thanks!
__label__non-neutral Joe?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Uh, youve had a lot of sex right?
__label__surprise When? Today? Some, not a lot.
__label__fear Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt.
__label__fear There huhhmm, there-there was an incident.
__label__neutral Dont worry about that man, that happens.
__label__surprise Its happened to you?
__label__neutral Yeah! Once.
__label__surprise Well, whatd you do?
__label__neutral I did it anyway.
__label__neutral Sup? Sup dude?
__label__fear Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me.
__label__neutral So youre playing a little
__label__disgust Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
__label__surprise Come on man, really how old?!
__label__disgust Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
__label__surprise And they knew about it?
__label__surprise Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
__label__anger Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
__label__anger Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just dont know what the big deal is!
__label__non-neutral The big deal is I dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! Cold beer.
__label__neutral Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
__label__non-neutral Do you always have to bring him here?
__label__neutral I didn't wanna leave him alone.
__label__neutral Alright?
__label__neutral We- we had our first fight this morning.
__label__neutral I think it has to do with my working late.
__label__neutral I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
__label__neutral Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
__label__joy Oh, that'd be great!
__label__neutral Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
__label__neutral Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
__label__neutral All right, check it out.
__label__neutral Check this out.
__label__non-neutral It says here that theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!
__label__neutral "Its almost as good as being there."
__label__joy Its better! You cant go to a museum in your underwear!
__label__joy Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
__label__neutral Uh, may I help you?
__label__neutral Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, Im the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
__label__neutral Look, its like I told you, theres nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
__label__neutral All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
__label__anger Nobody sees the king!
__label__neutral Oh-ho-kay, Im talking to the king.
__label__surprise Hey! You cant go back there!
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh?
__label__neutral I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore.
__label__sadness Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a
__label__surprise Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
__label__neutral I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
__label__non-neutral No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says hes gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
__label__non-neutral Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea.
__label__neutral Oh. Look, just friends, I wont grope you. I promise.
__label__non-neutral No, I just I think that its too soon.
__label__neutral No its not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
__label__neutral I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
__label__surprise And now you want that money back.
__label__neutral Exactly.
__label__non-neutral Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
__label__non-neutral Its not a real game! I made it up!
__label__non-neutral Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
__label__neutral I don't know.
__label__neutral But I can see through your sheet.
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah, that's her.
__label__neutral But y'know what?
__label__sadness Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
__label__neutral Why?
__label__sadness Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
__label__surprise What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
__label__non-neutral No. No. No. She lives on the
__label__neutral No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby.
__label__neutral And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway.
__label__neutral You've been counting wrong.
__label__non-neutral I did
__label__non-neutral Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this.
__label__non-neutral Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
__label__surprise Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
__label__neutral No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
__label__non-neutral All right, lets do it.
__label__joy Come on!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral All right, gentlemen, youre up first.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round beginsstop it now. What was Monicas nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
__label__neutral Big fat goalie.
__label__neutral Correct. Rachel claims
__label__neutral Dangerous Liaisons
__label__neutral Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
__label__neutral Weekend at Bernies
__label__neutral Well, look, why dont you just, why dont you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
__label__joy Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
__label__non-neutral No you cant.
__label__non-neutral Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
__label__non-neutral You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long.
__label__anger Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__sadness Im sorry.
__label__surprise And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio.
__label__fear You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
__label__neutral Well, that shouldnt be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
__label__neutral Pete, can I get you something else?
__label__neutral Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if youre given em out.
__label__neutral Havent you and I covered that topic?
__label__neutral Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you.
__label__non-neutral Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
__label__non-neutral Well, if that were true, Id dating my Aunt Ruth.
__label__disgust And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.
__label__neutral Come on, you think she should go out with me, dont you?
__label__non-neutral Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?
__label__disgust I mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean.
__label__disgust That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
__label__neutral I mean really, think about it.
__label__neutral Ho-ho, I will.
__label__surprise I believe I read that somewhere!
__label__anger That only is not funny, it's physically impossible!
__label__non-neutral Ok?
__label__non-neutral Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...
__label__anger It's not funny!
__label__anger !
__label__neutral I respectfully disagree.
__label__anger I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
__label__neutral Who cares? Nobody reads those things
__label__non-neutral You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.
__label__neutral I don't have a page.
__label__non-neutral Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
__label__non-neutral I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
__label__surprise Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
__label__non-neutral No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
__label__disgust So, rocks.
__label__sadness I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
__label__joy Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?
__label__joy I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
__label__surprise Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
__label__sadness Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
__label__neutral You
__label__neutral Why?
__label__joy Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop.  Get up! Get up! Get up!
__label__non-neutral I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you dont think your son will think its yours and be horribly traumatised?
__label__non-neutral Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
__label__neutral Ohh, its time to go.
__label__non-neutral Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clocks a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes.
__label__neutral Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes?
__label__neutral Twice?
__label__neutral Well thats ambitious.
__label__neutral Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
__label__surprise Thats Carol with your son!
__label__joy Mornings here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the mornings here! The mornings here!
__label__non-neutral HEY!! Do you
__label__joy Oh come on! Mornings here!  Mornings here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
__label__neutral I
__label__joy Are you kidding? I love that guy!  Mornings here! Morning is here
__label__non-neutral Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
__label__neutral Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
__label__non-neutral Monica, you dont even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
__label__neutral Yknow what? I am
__label__sadness Im sorry. Im so sorry.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral See, this is a
__label__anger Shut up! This place is a hole!
__label__neutral All right buddy, time to roll over.
__label__non-neutral No-no!
__label__non-neutral No, no-n-n-n-no!!
__label__non-neutral You are going to a clinic!
__label__non-neutral Youre going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
__label__neutral Are you under the sheet?
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__joy Great, lets begin.  Hows the pressure?
__label__joy Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
__label__non-neutral Stating the obvious, but thank you. And its not weird is it.
__label__non-neutral No. Ooohh
__label__neutral Thats right, you just enjoy.
__label__joy Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__joy Oh God Phoebe!!  Oh thats it! Thats it! Right there! Oh!  Ooooh-oooh-ooooh
__label__joy Hi!
__label__surprise Oh, Alice, hi!
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__non-neutral Im so glad you could come, cause Ive got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.
__label__surprise Oh my God, who died on this?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I know. Its a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
__label__non-neutral Become a drama critic!
__label__non-neutral I am hurt!  A plague on both your houses!
__label__sadness By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
__label__disgust Oh, classy.
__label__non-neutral Yep! I sure know how to pick em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!
__label__non-neutral Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
__label__surprise Really. What?
__label__non-neutral Uh, de-clawing cats.
__label__neutral Hey, tell ya what.
__label__neutral Let me walk you home.
__label__non-neutral Well stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
__label__surprise Why the Post?
__label__surprise Oh, you didnt see the Post?
__label__neutral No. You?
__label__neutral No. Why?
__label__joy Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
__label__neutral Uhh, well Ive got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt.  You got an extra one?
__label__neutral Yeah, sure. Ummhere.
__label__non-neutral Great.  You got anything thats not
__label__neutral Yeah, I dont think so Joe.
__label__neutral All right, I guess this will be fine.
__label__neutral Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
__label__neutral Nothing, why?
__label__neutral How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? Ill pay.
__label__disgust Huh, Rach I got to say its gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
__label__neutral Im not asking you to go on a
__label__surprise Really? Cause I could kinda use the money.
__label__neutral Joey, just-just he-hes new in town and I know he doesnt have any guy friends.
__label__neutral Just take him to like a ball game or something.
__label__neutral Ill really appreciate it.
__label__neutral Yeah, okay.
__label__surprise Yeah?
__label__joy Sure, no problem.  OohHey, donuts!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Problem odour in the litter box? Dont change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
__label__sadness Sorry, Pheebs.
__label__neutral Yeah. You okay?
__label__non-neutral No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
__label__neutral Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isnt tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
__label__sadness Yeah. Well, umm.....

__label__non-neutral All right, all right, Im coming over, and Im bringing Chinese food.
__label__sadness Oh, yeah, Im not, Im not hungry.
__label__neutral Its for me.
__label__neutral Oh. Okay, bye.
__label__fear Come on, pick up, pick up!
__label__neutral Hello?
__label__neutral Transit Authority?
__label__neutral Yes, hello.
__label__neutral I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus.
__label__non-neutral Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid character.
__label__neutral Hi, here's the deal.
__label__neutral We lost a carseat on a bus today.
__label__neutral It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller.
__label__neutral Oh, and there was a baby in it.
__label__neutral He wants to talk to you again.
__label__neutral Hello.
__label__neutral Im sorry Im a little late.
__label__surprise AhWhoa!
__label__non-neutral A lot late.
__label__neutral Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller.
__label__neutral So to sum up, Im Professor Geller.
__label__non-neutral Good job today.
__label__neutral Good evening, sir.
__label__neutral My name is Ross Geller.
__label__neutral I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment.
__label__neutral And I-I realize that the competition is fierce butI'm sorry.
__label__non-neutral I, I can't help but notice you're naked and  I applaud you.
__label__neutral Man, I wish I was naked.
__label__joy I mean, this-this looks so great.
__label__neutral That is how God intended it.
__label__non-neutral Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship!
__label__non-neutral But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!
__label__joy Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest!
__label__non-neutral Okay, you go!
__label__surprise My turn? What-what are you talking about?
__label__disgust Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."
__label__neutral And he said, "Laundry?
__label__neutral Is
__label__non-neutral Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
__label__non-neutral Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
__label__neutral Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Bigot.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Mr. Bigot. He tells the most
__label__non-neutral All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
__label__surprise Me and Chandler?!
__label__neutral I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
__label__neutral Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
__label__non-neutral I don't know! I didn't come with her!
__label__joy All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
__label__surprise A test?!!
__label__joy Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah!  We should have essay questions!!
__label__neutral Okay Ive got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
__label__neutral Id have to saythe talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that youre making me eat him.
__label__surprise Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? Im sorry.
__label__neutral Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
__label__neutral I think its best sir.
__label__neutral But we really do need to find someone up here.
__label__neutral The work is starting to pile up.
__label__neutral Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high.
__label__neutral Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em.
__label__neutral Thats a good one.
__label__neutral What does a guy have to
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
__label__joy Hi, Julie!
__label__neutral Isnt there a national football league.
__label__neutral Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
__label__sadness Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
__label__joy Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
__label__neutral When theyre hungry enough, theyll come in.
__label__neutral Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
__label__neutral I dont know. You uh, you got something for me?
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
__label__neutral Ten. Okay. Now Tag theres such a thing as too many women.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__joy Yeah, for you!
__label__surprise Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God!
__label__neutral That's
__label__non-neutral Hey, I've been honing!
__label__non-neutral What was with the dishes?
__label__fear Oh, uh..
__label__fear I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know?
__label__non-neutral I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
__label__surprise Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
__label__anger Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!
__label__disgust Great, now he's waving back.
__label__disgust Man, we gotta do something about that guy.
__label__disgust This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment.
__label__non-neutral It creeps me out!
__label__anger I feel like I can't do stuff!
__label__non-neutral What kinda stuff?
__label__disgust Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
__label__surprise You cook naked?
__label__neutral Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
__label__surprise What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
__label__neutral Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
__label__non-neutral Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt called. Not that I even care, y'know.
__label__neutral Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to.
__label__anger You think you know me so well.
__label__neutral Well, dont cha wanna?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Okay, well I do know you.
__label__neutral Thats what I said.
__label__neutral Well so?
__label__sadness I cant.
__label__sadness I cant.
__label__sadness She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone.
__label__sadness Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like all my lives.
__label__neutral Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
__label__neutral Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
__label__neutral It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
__label__joy It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
__label__non-neutral Nuh-uh.
__label__non-neutral Yuh-huh.
__label__surprise So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
__label__disgust Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.
__label__surprise This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
__label__neutral No.
__label__non-neutral Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
__label__non-neutral Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my
__label__neutral There you go.
__label__non-neutral Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
__label__neutral That's the rule.
__label__anger What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
__label__non-neutral How'd you get to that?
__label__non-neutral Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
__label__surprise You knew about that?
__label__disgust Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
__label__neutral Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
__label__non-neutral What do you mean, like, buy it together?
__label__neutral Yeah
__label__non-neutral You think we're ready for something like that?
__label__neutral Why not?
__label__neutral Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
__label__non-neutral Why, are you moving out?
__label__neutral I'm not moving out.
__label__fear You'd tell me if you were moving out right
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
__label__non-neutral Aw, I know all about Kip!
__label__non-neutral It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
__label__non-neutral Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
__label__non-neutral Aw, don't do that
__label__non-neutral Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
__label__neutral Oh no, stay here well keep doing this. Ill pay you.
__label__neutral No, I got in trouble for that before. Ill see you later.
__label__joy Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss.
__label__non-neutral Oh my God! Oh my God! Im so sorry!
__label__neutral Aw forget it, its from
__label__anger You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! Im gonna kill you!!
__label__sadness Yknow this is actually not a great time for me.
__label__joy Okay! So, well just stay married.
__label__joy Yes, exactly!
__label__joy And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
__label__non-neutral Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Id have to talk you into this more.
__label__fear Okay, see now Im scared because I dont actually think youre kidding.
__label__non-neutral Im-Im not kidding. Look I-I, I cant have
__label__surprise What-wh-what so well just stay married forever?!
__label__neutral Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you?
__label__non-neutral Really?
__label__joy I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.!
__label__neutral Its
__label__sadness Ohh, okay, Im sorry.
__label__neutral Youre right.
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__non-neutral We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far
__label__neutral Im asking you to do me a favor.
__label__non-neutral You are asking me to be your wife!
__label__neutral And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral I know, I know, I'm such an idiot.
__label__non-neutral I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week.
__label__non-neutral I mean, how clean can teeth get?
__label__neutral My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
__label__neutral Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
__label__neutral -leg?
__label__neutral That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
__label__surprise You actually broke her watch?
__label__surprise Ooh, steer clear of you.
__label__neutral That's right.
__label__sadness Barry, I'm sorry...
__label__sadness I am so sorry...
__label__sadness I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...
__label__neutral No real-, honey, really its fine, just g-go with Susan.
__label__non-neutral Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea.
__label__neutral Okay, okay, bye
__label__neutral So what are they doing?
__label__non-neutral I dont know, something girlie.
__label__neutral Hey, youre early.
__label__surprise What are you doing with the lamp?
__label__neutral Im just taking it to be re-wired.
__label__disgust Oh, well dont take it to the same place you took the stereo, cause theyve had that thing for over a week.
__label__neutral No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
__label__anger Youre disturbing my oboe practice.
__label__non-neutral You dont play the oboe!
__label__anger I could play the oboe!
__label__joy Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
__label__joy Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
__label__anger All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
__label__surprise What is going on?
__label__anger What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!
__label__surprise Ross!
__label__anger I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!
__label__anger What do I have to do to get some service?!
__label__neutral Hi Rach.
__label__neutral Ross?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__joy Hey its Mona! From the wedding.
__label__joy Oh hi!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__surprise Wow! Uhhow are you?
__label__neutral Im good except umm, you still owe me a dance.
__label__non-neutral Oh thats right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
__label__surprise Oh youre serious. Sure!
__label__non-neutral Great! Well umm
__label__neutral I think I might need one more cup of coffee.
__label__neutral Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__sadness Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him.
__label__anger Go!
__label__surprise What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
__label__anger I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wont quit.
__label__neutral I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
__label__surprise Oh God Oh, hes in there right now?
__label__neutral Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
__label__non-neutral Uh, lets rip!
__label__surprise Really? Are you sure?
__label__joy Oh Phoebe!
__label__neutral Okay, sorry. Yeah.
__label__neutral Hey Rach.
__label__joy Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
__label__joy Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and    I wanted to share it with you.
__label__joy Oh, you're so wonderful.
__label__non-neutral Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period.
__label__non-neutral Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death    .
__label__non-neutral I think there are people in there having sex.
__label__neutral It can't be me, I'm standing right here.
__label__neutral Wanna peek?
__label__disgust No!
__label__surprise Come on!
__label__non-neutral Y'know what? I don't like you without mom.  Come on.
__label__non-neutral We're not peeking?
__label__surprise Well I'm peeking.  Oh my God!
__label__neutral Hello sir, you know Monica.
__label__joy Chandler is fantastic!!
__label__surprise What?!
__label__joy Oh God, we just clicked!
__label__joy Yknow how people just click?
__label__joy Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click!
__label__surprise Did he tell you?
__label__non-neutral Oh, I....
__label__joy Oh, and hes got such a good heart! Doesnt he have a good heart?
__label__non-neutral Oh, I know...
__label__joy Oh, I know and hes soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.
__label__joy Isnt this great?!
__label__neutral Dont spoil it.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__joy Hi, sweetie!
__label__neutral Hello.
__label__neutral Hi, Ross.
__label__neutral Yeah, huh.
__label__sadness Ive got some bad news.
__label__fear What?
__label__neutral I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
__label__non-neutral Come on sweetie! Youve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
__label__non-neutral Actually, its kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
__label__non-neutral But work comes first!  Oh hey, but thats sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
__label__neutral Nooo, hes leaving for a better job.
__label__non-neutral Oh well thats great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh?  Good bye.
__label__neutral Okay, then.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__sadness Well were gonna miss you around here.
__label__sadness Yeah, me too.
__label__neutral So, see ya on Saturday.
__label__neutral Yeah, you bet.
__label__neutral Whazzup??
__label__non-neutral Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
__label__neutral Listen, can you do me a favor?
__label__neutral I'm gonna be out today.
__label__neutral Can you    just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
__label__surprise You don't trust him?
__label__neutral I think the check in is that way.
__label__neutral Ahh.
__label__neutral Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
__label__non-neutral Well theres some people who do want to marry me.
__label__surprise There are?
__label__non-neutral Yeah! Richard!
__label__surprise R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?!
__label__neutral Thats right.
__label__neutral Chandler
__label__surprise You just told me that he hates marriage!
__label__non-neutral That-that hes a-a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife!
__label__non-neutral That-that hes against marriage and always will be!
__label__neutral You got
__label__fear You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
__label__neutral I knew.
__label__surprise You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
__label__neutral I did.
__label__sadness Oh.
__label__fear Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?
__label__neutral Sometime?
__label__neutral Maybe?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, maybe...
__label__joy Okay... okay, maybe I will...
__label__surprise Why?
__label__neutral Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
__label__joy Well, youre amazing.
__label__neutral Oh no-no-no.
__label__surprise A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
__label__non-neutral Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
__label__joy Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
__label__non-neutral Oh, I dont know.
__label__joy Oh-no-no-no, you are!
__label__joy You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that.
__label__neutral You mean with Casey.
__label__neutral No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes pretty cool.
__label__neutral Or Casey.
__label__neutral No-no, Kathy.
__label__neutral Could be Casey.
__label__neutral No. No, Kathy.
__label__neutral Consider Casey.
__label__non-neutral Yknow what I think?
__label__joy I think somebodys got a little crush on Casey.
__label__non-neutral How bout I fix you two up?
__label__non-neutral What do you think?
__label__joy That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
__label__neutral Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
__label__neutral Honey, whats the matter?
__label__neutral I just saw Janice.
__label__non-neutral Cause every time I see your face, I cant help but fall from grace. I know.....
__label__non-neutral Wow! This girl is good.
__label__non-neutral Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
__label__neutral I like her.
__label__neutral Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
__label__neutral Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from these people.
__label__non-neutral Look at you. All jealous.
__label__neutral Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, shes more.. y'know, and youre more
__label__neutral beside meeeee-eeee-ee. .
__label__non-neutral Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy shes done.
__label__neutral Okay, my next songs called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say.
__label__neutral I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldnt Have Left You That Way.
__label__neutral Oh no, one of those look for the hidden meaning songs.
__label__neutral Yes, hello.
__label__neutral I have a question.
__label__neutral Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.
__label__neutral A beard and a moustache.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral No,
__label__surprise What?! What else did he say?
__label__neutral Umm, he said he thought I was funny.
__label__neutral So Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
__label__non-neutral Ross, no! There is
__label__neutral Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
__label__non-neutral Ross, I am a human doodle!!
__label__neutral Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun!
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna
__label__neutral Okay, there was
__label__non-neutral Come on!
__label__non-neutral Oh wait, dont you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies?
__label__neutral No, its okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I dont
__label__neutral Oh yeah? Okay.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__surprise But! Dont you have to give him his money back?
__label__non-neutral Uh-huh.  Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you.  Okay, lets go see Monica!
__label__surprise Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
__label__neutral You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
__label__non-neutral So?!
__label__surprise Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade?
__label__non-neutral Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
__label__neutral Oh right, right.
__label__non-neutral I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
__label__surprise Well usually...yeah!
__label__neutral Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
__label__neutral Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me.
__label__sadness Im such a jerk.
__label__neutral Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
__label__joy Hmmm... this is so nice.
__label__neutral OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
__label__neutral OK.
__label__neutral OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
__label__surprise Ohhh!!!!
__label__neutral Yes, yes, that's right...
__label__surprise Oh, look at the little cat!
__label__surprise What?  Ow!
__label__neutral Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
__label__neutral I didn't mean
__label__non-neutral Why not?
__label__joy It's brilliant!
__label__joy Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!
__label__neutral well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding...
__label__neutral Thank you, Chandler.
__label__neutral Sincerely.
__label__joy Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
__label__non-neutral How do you think I should propose?
__label__neutral David, I'm pretending to
__label__joy Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  Come on Joey! You cant win if you dont ask any
__label__surprise What?!
__label__joy Well, you promised me a fun road trip!
__label__anger Weve been on the road six hours and youve been asleep for five and a half!
__label__non-neutral We are switching at the next rest stop and
__label__neutral All right. All right.
__label__non-neutral Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radios broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
__label__surprise Really? I dont
__label__anger Sing!!
__label__non-neutral Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
__label__joy Morning!
__label__joy Everything was delicious!
__label__joy Thank you!
__label__joy It was. The duck in particular was superb.
__label__joy Thank you!    You haven't said anything...
__label__neutral Actually I do have one small complaint.
__label__neutral Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
__label__non-neutral The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind    of a mood-killer!
__label__surprise What musician?
__label__neutral We did?
__label__non-neutral You owe me 20 bucks.
__label__joy Thank you. Thank you so much!
__label__neutral Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
__label__surprise Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?
__label__non-neutral What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
__label__neutral All right, I'm nine years old.
__label__non-neutral Oh, I hate this story.
__label__neutral We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
__label__sadness I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
__label__surprise Oh my god.
__label__sadness Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
__label__surprise Hey, who's this little naked guy?
__label__neutral That little naked guy would be me.
__label__surprise Aww, look at the little thing.
__label__non-neutral Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
__label__surprise Who are those people?
__label__surprise Got me.
__label__neutral Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
__label__surprise Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
__label__neutral Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
__label__neutral Looks like a fun gang.
__label__joy Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
__label__non-neutral Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
__label__non-neutral So, whats this about?
__label__neutral Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
__label__neutral No.  This is my red sweater.
__label__fear Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me? Okay.
__label__non-neutral Whats going on Rach?
__label__non-neutral Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
__label__non-neutral Yknow, Im actually glad Phoebe called.
__label__non-neutral I know we broke up because you thought I wasnt mature enough, but Ive really grown up and think we should get back together.
__label__non-neutral Oh, its just not the right time.
__label__non-neutral It is the right time.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Kay!
__label__neutral in the category of Favorite Returning Male Character the nominees are: John Wheeler from
__label__surprise What the?!
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Youre an Aquarius, huh?
__label__neutral I bet youre a Gemini.
__label__neutral Nope.
__label__neutral Taurus?
__label__neutral Nope.
__label__neutral Virgo?
__label__neutral Nope.
__label__neutral Sagittarius?
__label__neutral Yep.
__label__joy I knew it! I knew it, ahh.
__label__neutral Well I tell you what
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Youre not gonna speed anymore right?
__label__neutral I wont speed.
__label__neutral And you promise youll get this taken care of right away?
__label__neutral I promise.
__label__neutral And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
__label__neutral Yeah!
__label__neutral Can he handle the stick?
__label__neutral Oh well
__label__non-neutral I can handle the stick!!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Oh hi.
__label__non-neutral I cant believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
__label__non-neutral Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when youre trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
__label__surprise Weirdest thing. Did I hearMother of God its true!
__label__surprise Chandler Bing!
__label__surprise Jan-Janice!
__label__non-neutral Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
__label__neutral Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.
__label__surprise Janice I didnt even know you were pregnant! Whos the unwitting human whos essence youve stolen?
__label__neutral Its you. This is yours.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__joy Look how nervous he gets! We havent slept together in years!
__label__fear Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
__label__non-neutral Man, Im starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
__label__neutral Yknow, yknow Im lookin and I dont think anyones home here.
__label__neutral I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and yknow explain later.
__label__surprise Yeah? Really? No ones home?
__label__neutral I dont think so. Hello?  When you get in there
__label__neutral Hey, what's up?
__label__sadness I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
__label__sadness Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
__label__anger Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
__label__anger You had no relationship!!
__label__anger No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
__label__anger Oh God, stop with the plan!
__label__neutral So what, so what you saw him with a girl?
__label__anger Who cares?!
__label__anger That doesn't mean anything!
__label__neutral Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
__label__non-neutral She was kinda stupid.
__label__neutral You're right.
__label__neutral All right, I'm just gonna go on the date.
__label__neutral I'm gonna go on the date.
__label__neutral That is the new plan.
__label__non-neutral Come on, hurry!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__surprise Phoebe!
__label__joy Ta-da.

__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__neutral Sparkly.
__label__joy So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh.
__label__neutral Mr. major capades guy.
__label__neutral I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
__label__joy You always said I'd make it.
__label__neutral Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.
__label__neutral I missed you.  I'm gonna get changed.
__label__neutral OK.

__label__neutral Oh, right, OK. Ole.
__label__neutral What?
__label__joy Um, the matador.  Ole, ha ha ha.
__label__joy Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait    for your party tonight.
__label__neutral Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call?
__label__neutral Thanks, bye.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral What's happenin'?
__label__sadness Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman    show tonight.
__label__neutral Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and    so, you know me, work comes first
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...
__label__joy "Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight"
__label__anger Stupid Jane Rogers!!
__label__surprise You are having a party tonight??
__label__neutral Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
__label__non-neutral And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were    gonna get away with that?
__label__neutral I do it every year.
__label__surprise You do that every year??
__label__anger I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
__label__non-neutral Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us??
__label__neutral Yeah...
__label__non-neutral And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times    restaurant?
__label__neutral Yeah...
__label__non-neutral OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime    tour of that button factory?
__label__surprise Who's this from?
__label__neutral Oh, that's Ross's.
__label__surprise Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered.
__label__neutral Remembered what?
__label__surprise It was like months ago.
__label__non-neutral We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__surprise I can't believe he remembered!
__label__surprise Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
__label__surprise I can't believe he did this.
__label__neutral Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
__label__surprise What did you just say?
__label__fear F-hah.... flennin....
__label__surprise Oh.... my God.
__label__joy I really like waking up with you.
__label__joy I like waking up with you too.  Oh! It's such a beautiful morning.  Oh, I can stay here all day.
__label__joy That would be great!
__label__joy We could have breakfast in bed
__label__non-neutral Wait, just a second.
__label__surprise Okay.  Oh! Oh no.
__label__sadness Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from
__label__surprise Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__surprise This is Bonnie?  This is Bonnie?  Youre Bonnie?
__label__neutral I can show you an ID if you want?
__label__surprise Oh no, Im sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
__label__neutral Oh, that must be it.
__label__neutral Well I hope you have fun tonight.
__label__joy Thanks! You too.
__label__neutral I believe it.
__label__non-neutral No you dont.
__label__neutral Yes, I do.
__label__anger No you doy'know what, youre not gonna suck me into this.
__label__anger Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
__label__anger I do not always have to beokay, okay.
__label__neutral Jurassic Park
__label__fear I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
__label__neutral Maybe we should check the trash chute.
__label__neutral Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
__label__neutral That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral There he is!
__label__anger Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!
__label__neutral Just, y'know out.
__label__non-neutral Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
__label__neutral What were you doing?
__label__neutral I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
__label__non-neutral You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
__label__non-neutral He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
__label__anger Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
__label__joy He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
__label__neutral Ross you left you scarf in Hey you guys.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, that looks good.
__label__neutral You guys make a
__label__joy Yeah, we look great together.
__label__neutral Yeah, we
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__joy Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
__label__neutral Yknow, we dont have to imagine.
__label__joy Im marrying her.
__label__neutral Well just see.
__label__non-neutral Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
__label__neutral Hi Joey.
__label__neutral Hey! How you doin?
__label__joy He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
__label__neutral Id love to show ya, but I just tucked her in.
__label__neutral Shes sleeping.
__label__neutral Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
__label__sadness Well, the old lady died.
__label__neutral And how do I know?
__label__neutral Her dying wish was for one last kiss.
__label__non-neutral But I dont care,  because you got the apartment.
__label__joy Yes!
__label__disgust Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think Im gonna stay here.
__label__joy Isnt that great?
__label__non-neutral Ezels!!
__label__non-neutral Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, its not your fault.
__label__non-neutral Wow, thats great.
__label__joy Oh, yeah!
__label__neutral Y'know you could totally sell this. Itd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
__label__non-neutral I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
__label__surprise What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
__label__neutral Okay, well if I was in this for the money, Id be a millionaire by now, y'know.
__label__neutral You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
__label__neutral Aw, youre right, youre right. Im sorry.
__label__non-neutral Thats okay. All right, Im gonna play song thats really, really sad. Its called Magician Box Mix Up.
__label__neutral Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right.
__label__neutral Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right?
__label__joy Okay, great.
__label__disgust You freak.
__label__joy Thank you.
__label__neutral Um, coffee to go, please.
__label__neutral Isabella Rosselini.
__label__surprise Are you serious?  Oh my God.
__label__non-neutral Damn! I cant believe I took her off my list.
__label__neutral Why? Cause otherwise youd go for it?
__label__neutral Yeah, maybe.
__label__disgust Oh-oh, you lie.
__label__neutral What you dont think Id go up to her?
__label__neutral Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
__label__anger Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
__label__neutral You know what honey, you go ahead, well call her an alternate.
__label__neutral Okay, hold my crawler.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__surprise Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
__label__non-neutral Honey, hes about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. Im just sorry we dont got popcorn.
__label__neutral Okay, that's, that's enough.
__label__neutral '....
__label__non-neutral Won't you dance around with me.
__label__surprise A-ha!!!
__label__joy Oh-oh-oh, yeah!  That's right, you take good care of those babies!
__label__surprise Excuse me?
__label__joy It's me, Joey!
__label__surprise Do I know you?
__label__non-neutral Joey!
__label__neutral Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
__label__neutral Okay thats fair.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Good!
__label__neutral Pick one.
__label__joy Left!  Thank you.
__label__neutral Youre welcome.
__label__surprise Ross!
__label__non-neutral Joey!  We should just switch.
__label__joy Yeah absolutely!
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__sadness Rachel, were sorry for pushing those guys on you.
__label__joy Oh thats all right!
__label__joy Yknow, I ended up having a really good time.
__label__joy Yknow, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
__label__neutral So what was it for anyway?
__label__neutral I wanna say a disease.
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__neutral I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on
__label__neutral Huh. All right.
__label__surprise Oh my God, look! Thats Elizabeth!
__label__neutral Oh-oh Professor Geller.
__label__neutral Ahh, to be 13 again.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
__label__anger No! He blew us off!
__label__surprise What?!
__label__surprise I know!
__label__anger I cant believe it.  Can I tell you something? Im a little mad at him now.
__label__anger Can I tell you something? Me too.
__label__anger Yknow what? He didnt want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we dont talk to him
__label__joy Ooooh! Freeze him out.
__label__joy Thats right!
__label__joy I like it!
__label__neutral Doorknob?
__label__neutral Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
__label__joy Oh good.
__label__fear Look, I  Look, Im having a great time with you and I just dont want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us.
__label__sadness So, Im sorry I just dont think we should go away together yet.
__label__fear Its-its too soon.
__label__surprise Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that Im going to Florida for a couple weeks.
__label__surprise No. I think you misunderstood what
__label__joy You are so adorable.
__label__joy That! Lets talk about that.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral How do you feel?
__label__neutral Well, lets just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
__label__neutral Okay, so I
__label__neutral And protected them from a tornado?
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral I know, the babies are asleep.
__label__surprise Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
__label__joy I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
__label__surprise But my apartment!
__label__neutral Was the setting of Phoebes triumph.
__label__non-neutral But the mess!
__label__neutral Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
__label__neutral Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out.
__label__neutral Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!
__label__neutral When will that be?
__label__neutral !
__label__non-neutral Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey Ross! The babys kicking!
__label__surprise What?! It is?!
__label__non-neutral Its not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again.
__label__non-neutral Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
__label__joy Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joeys room and he was sleeping
__label__neutral A dreamless sleep.
__label__non-neutral So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
__label__neutral Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
__label__neutral Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral When are you coming home?
__label__surprise What? Guys, I'm not.
__label__neutral C'mon, this is us.
__label__neutral I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
__label__surprise Waitressing?
__label__neutral Okay, I'm not just waitressing.
__label__neutral I'm..
__label__neutral I, um...
__label__neutral I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh...
__label__non-neutral I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
__label__neutral We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
__label__neutral So, um, will you bring the truck?
__label__neutral I'll even let you ring the bell.
__label__surprise Oh, my god.
__label__non-neutral See, there you go, the cleansing works!
__label__neutral They're nice guys.
__label__joy Oh, they're firemen guys.
__label__neutral Your son.
__label__anger No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
__label__neutral Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
__label__surprise What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,
__label__non-neutral Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
__label__neutral I got it.
__label__neutral I got it.
__label__non-neutral I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
__label__neutral No, you don't.
__label__anger All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
__label__surprise Why?
__label__anger He started it!
__label__non-neutral No, you started it.
__label__anger You did!
__label__anger I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
__label__neutral But...
__label__anger Now go!
__label__non-neutral Thanks a lot.
__label__non-neutral See what you did.
__label__neutral Yeah, listen...
__label__anger Out
__label__non-neutral Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say?
__label__neutral Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
__label__surprise Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
__label__neutral Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi.
__label__neutral Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
__label__neutral You didnt say Boutros Boutros Gali.
__label__neutral Boutros Boutros Gali.
__label__neutral He says he was too.
__label__neutral Interesting.
__label__neutral So I was wondering....
__label__non-neutral Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
__label__joy Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.
__label__neutral So you're a chef?
__label__joy Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
__label__surprise Oh, really.
__label__non-neutral Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing?
__label__neutral Well, I was having a conversation.
__label__anger Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I havent been able to say two words to each other.
__label__anger What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
__label__neutral That would be great. Thank you.
__label__disgust so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera!
__label__neutral Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
__label__surprise When did that happen to you?!
__label__non-neutral Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera!
__label__disgust Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
__label__joy Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it.
__label__non-neutral Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
__label__neutral Here, I'll get it.
__label__neutral We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
__label__joy Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
__label__non-neutral Oh, great!
__label__non-neutral Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!
__label__surprise That was unbelievable!
__label__non-neutral Okay, see? I told you!
__label__sadness Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
__label__non-neutral I don't believe they're brother and sister.
__label__surprise They're brother and sister!!!
__label__neutral Action!
__label__non-neutral I found the picture!
__label__surprise What picture?!
__label__non-neutral The picture of my wife! In your pack!
__label__non-neutral You went through my personal property?
__label__anger Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
__label__non-neutral Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years!
__label__joy Cut! Wonderful!
__label__joy Great scene yeah?
__label__joy Oh youre awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
__label__joy Thanks a lot.
__label__neutral Heres your call sheet for tomorrow.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__joy So Chandler, your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
__label__joy I remember when we first got engaged.
__label__neutral Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story.
__label__non-neutral Oh dad, really you dont need to
__label__non-neutral Well, Id gotten Judy pregnant. I still dont know how that happened.
__label__disgust You dont know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
__label__neutral What a sweet story.
__label__disgust Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
__label__surprise What?! They wanted a scary story!
__label__joy Anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.
__label__surprise What?
__label__fear You tell her Jack, I cant do it.
__label__surprise What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund dont you?
__label__non-neutral We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
__label__neutral After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
__label__joy Did that!
__label__neutral Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
__label__surprise Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
__label__surprise Was it not pain-free?
__label__disgust No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
__label__neutral Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad.
__label__non-neutral Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.
__label__neutral But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest.
__label__surprise Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
__label__non-neutral Now, are you glad we didnt start with the bikini strips?
__label__neutral now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
__label__neutral I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
__label__neutral Do you wanna start telling secrets?
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__neutral Now umm, remember Im still learning.
__label__neutral One, two, three, four!
__label__joy You know the song! Sing along!
__label__neutral So?
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__surprise Oh my God! Thats David!
__label__neutral David who?
__label__sadness David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral Oh, you say someones name enough, they turn around.
__label__surprise Phoebe?
__label__surprise David!  What-what are you doing here? Arent you supposed to be in Russia?
__label__neutral Yeah, Im just, Im just in town for a conference. Umm,
__label__joy Well Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
__label__neutral Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy Yes! Santa's coming!
__label__sadness Hey, uh, Im really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
__label__neutral Its no big deal. Hey, yknow, you do what you gotta do. Right?
__label__neutral But hey, its not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides
__label__non-neutral Whatever.
__label__non-neutral Its like that everywhere, Joey!
__label__neutral Okay, Mon, back me up here.
__label__neutral Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right?
__label__neutral And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
__label__sadness I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
__label__neutral Look, Ross, really its-its no big deal.
__label__sadness Yknow you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so be it.
__label__neutral Yknow, hey I understand.
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__neutral Hey, when Im in a play and youre in the audience, I dont talk to you, right?
__label__neutral So its yknow, its uh, its cool.
__label__neutral Ill see you tomorrow.
__label__neutral Yeah, when were in the audience he doesnt talk to us, but he does wave.
__label__non-neutral You did look like an idiot.
__label__non-neutral Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot.
__label__neutral All right?
__label__non-neutral Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?"
__label__joy And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
__label__neutral Yeah that's the same.
__label__non-neutral That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
__label__neutral Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
__label__neutral Which one?
__label__sadness Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
__label__non-neutral Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about.
__label__sadness Y'know, for me anyway.
__label__sadness And of course, the Indians.
__label__anger Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
__label__neutral Hi, guys.
__label__joy Hi! Phoebe.
__label__neutral Hi Phoebe.
__label__sadness I-I wanted to apologise if Iyknow seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Yknow its just the hormones, yknow.
__label__neutral No we
__label__neutral Hormones.
__label__neutral hormones, yeah.
__label__non-neutral Your parents?
__label__neutral Yeah, theyre out of town.
__label__surprise Ohh.
__label__neutral Yeah-yeah, its this
__label__neutral Yeah that works.
__label__fear They-they-they can smell fear.
__label__joy Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
__label__neutral Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
__label__neutral Yes, hi.
__label__joy Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.
__label__sadness I didnt know you and Carol were getting divorced, Im sorry.
__label__joy Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!
__label__neutral No leg-chewing for us sir.
__label__neutral Oh well, give it time.
__label__joy So the divorce, the marriage, weve got a lot to celebrate.
__label__neutral How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?
__label__non-neutral I cant think of anything were doing.  Why cant I think of anything were doing?
__label__joy Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six.
__label__joy They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
__label__joy Okay, Ill see you tomorrow!
__label__neutral Just so you know, were not seeing him tomorrow.
__label__disgust I-I cannot spend another evening with that man.
__label__disgust Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
__label__neutral No.
__label__disgust Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
__label__disgust Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts
__label__neutral Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs
__label__neutral How many times have I told you guys, you
__label__neutral Hi Chandler.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
__label__non-neutral Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
__label__neutral William Sonoma
__label__neutral Expect it in 4-6 weeks.
__label__neutral Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
__label__neutral Yeah, so?
__label__neutral Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
__label__neutral Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
__label__surprise Why?
__label__neutral Why?
__label__neutral What's your point?
__label__neutral So uh, whats your name?
__label__neutral It's Jake.
__label__neutral Joey.  Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
__label__neutral Yeah, big fan.
__label__joy Me too! Theres a game on Tuesday, do you wanna go?
__label__joy Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure Im not doing anything Tuesday.
__label__disgust Ugh.  Ross!
__label__neutral Hi! Sorry Im late. Were you sleeping?
__label__non-neutral Ahh, nooo!!
__label__joy Oh, great!
__label__neutral Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery.
__label__neutral I got you the best one I could, cause thats not where you want to skimp.
__label__joy Youre a genius, Ross.
__label__neutral Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
__label__neutral Okay, Ill pay you tomorrow.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay, bye!!
__label__sadness So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
__label__neutral Yeah, okay, bye.
__label__neutral So Im gonna take off then!
__label__surprise Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
__label__joy Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
__label__neutral Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
__label__neutral Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
__label__neutral Yeah, sure.  All right, whose court is the ball in now?
__label__non-neutral I thought there wasn't a ball?
__label__neutral Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
__label__neutral Rachel, this is my friend Tom.
__label__surprise Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
__label__non-neutral You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.
__label__neutral So you work at
__label__neutral Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
__label__surprise I'm sorry?
__label__neutral No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy.
__label__non-neutral I know what's going on here.
__label__non-neutral Your Danny's wingman right?
__label__non-neutral You guys are best buds.
__label__non-neutral Frat bros!
__label__non-neutral I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
__label__disgust Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
__label__non-neutral Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
__label__neutral I think I need a drink.
__label__non-neutral Yeah!
__label__neutral Hey, Pheebs?
__label__anger No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
__label__sadness Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again.
__label__neutral And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.
__label__non-neutral You really think I'm ready?
__label__joy Uh-huh!
__label__joy Wow! Cool!
__label__neutral Was the chord at least right
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__neutral Well, this has been fun.
__label__joy Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
__label__neutral Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya.
__label__neutral Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457.
__label__neutral And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
__label__neutral Were beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
__label__joy Im really glad we came.  Youre so pretty. I love you.
__label__neutral Okay, thats a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
__label__neutral Excuse me, Im sorry, Im gonna have to call you back, Ive got a Schemp in my office.
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral Im sorry.
__label__neutral But ah, hey, oh, somebodys off the phone, how bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
__label__neutral Ross youre not listening to me, I dont have time to stop.
__label__neutral Come on Rach, you dont have what, ten minutes?
__label__anger I dont have ten minutes!!
__label__neutral What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
__label__anger Hey, Ross!!! I told you I dont!
__label__sadness Dont yell at me okay, this is the most Ive seen you all week.
__label__neutral Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, Ive got a deadline, would you just go home, Ill talk to you later.
__label__neutral Yeah, but wait...
__label__neutral Good bye!
__label__neutral Actually, thats our three hole punch.
__label__surprise Oh yeah? When?
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral I'll tell you what.
__label__neutral When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
__label__surprise Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
__label__neutral Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
__label__non-neutral Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
__label__neutral No, no, no.
__label__non-neutral What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
__label__neutral Uh, uh.
__label__surprise Well?
__label__surprise Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__surprise Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
__label__surprise Did you go home and change?
__label__neutral Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
__label__neutral No, I haven't seen him.
__label__surprise Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him?
__label__neutral Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
__label__neutral Yeah, why?
__label__neutral No reason.
__label__joy I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!
__label__surprise What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
__label__non-neutral All right, Ill do it just this once! But you cant tell anybody!
__label__joy Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
__label__neutral Yeah, thats her.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__surprise Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that sign didnt work!
__label__neutral Yknow what would work?
__label__neutral Hmm?
__label__anger Stop making candy!
__label__non-neutral But they like it!
__label__neutral You mean they like you.
__label__neutral Maybe.
__label__surprise Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
__label__anger Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
__label__anger We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled CUT!
__label__surprise Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
__label__joy Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
__label__non-neutral Cos I was gonna say theres no way you couldve done the end the way you guys did it back then!
__label__surprise What? We could do it!
__label__non-neutral I dont know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
__label__non-neutral I can do it, okay? Come on, lets go.
__label__neutral 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
__label__non-neutral I cant do it!
__label__neutral Now you do that, youre on TV.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral So, what are you guys in the market for? Weve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
__label__neutral Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. Thats the stuff. What do you think?
__label__neutral Well, I dont have to buy that, "Im with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
__label__neutral Well, I like it. Here you go.
__label__non-neutral All right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you? Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day?
__label__surprise Oh, I embarrass you?
__label__neutral How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you?
__label__non-neutral Hes just jealous. Youll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
__label__neutral Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
__label__neutral Theyre all tourists.
__label__disgust All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah?  If youre gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
__label__non-neutral Good choice.
__label__non-neutral Thanks.
__label__anger Okay, wait. All right, thats it, okay, Im out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
__label__surprise So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
__label__surprise What?
__label__anger Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.
__label__neutral And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my
__label__surprise Whoa, whoa, whoa.
__label__anger You don't even know me...
__label__surprise Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
__label__surprise What?
__label__sadness The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
__label__sadness I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
__label__neutral No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
__label__neutral Oh yeah.
__label__neutral Okay, forward. ForwardStop!  Okay, backStop!  Okay, forwardStop! Stop! Stop!
__label__neutral Ross, just forget about it. This guys got you totally wedged in.
__label__neutral Is this yours?
__label__neutral Well actually
__label__non-neutral No-no-no! Its mine! Its-its mine.
__label__neutral Dude, you soooo need this car.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay, heres what were gonna do.
__label__non-neutral Okay, Im gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral.
__label__neutral You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral All right, here we go.
__label__non-neutral Haul ass!!!
__label__neutral !
__label__neutral So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain.
__label__neutral So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
__label__joy ...and live forever as a machine!
__label__joy That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?
__label__neutral You and I, we're interfacing.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I gotta go.
__label__joy Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
__label__neutral David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
__label__neutral Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
__label__neutral See?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
__label__neutral Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
__label__neutral Oh, I should go, too.
__label__neutral Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
__label__non-neutral Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there.
__label__non-neutral And she was like "Oh, don't worry!
__label__neutral I asked him.
__label__non-neutral He's totally ok with seeing you!".
__label__joy So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
__label__non-neutral Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
__label__non-neutral Exactly!
__label__neutral And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
__label__non-neutral I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,
__label__neutral Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
__label__joy Ok, that'll be great!
__label__disgust Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
__label__disgust That's not what we're gonna do!
__label__disgust Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
__label__joy Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
__label__neutral Hello Skidmark.
__label__neutral Its a nickname, Ill explain later.
__label__neutral Its pretty clear.
__label__neutral Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
__label__surprise Thats why you broke up with me?
__label__non-neutral You-you-you didnt know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!
__label__joy Ni-chou chi-ma!
__label__non-neutral Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
__label__neutral Hi everyone.
__label__neutral I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
__label__non-neutral Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
__label__neutral Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
__label__fear What did, what did he say?
__label__neutral Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.
__label__neutral So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so.
__label__neutral .
__label__neutral .
__label__joy Oh, great!
__label__joy We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
__label__non-neutral Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly.
__label__joy All I could think of was yknow, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
__label__neutral And did he?
__label__joy Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
__label__neutral Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
__label__joy I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks today and Ive only had six.
__label__non-neutral Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.
__label__sadness Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I?
__label__disgust You sound like a guy.
__label__disgust No, a guy would be saying, "Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!
__label__surprise Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up!
__label__sadness I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again.
__label__neutral Youll have a last kiss.
__label__joy Thank you so much for coming back over.
__label__non-neutral Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
__label__neutral I know Mona, just hear me out.
__label__neutral First of all, Im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own.
__label__neutral Youre gonna have to tell me how you did that.
__label__neutral Focus.
__label__neutral Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are
__label__neutral All right wheres that turkey!
__label__surprise Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
__label__joy Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
__label__neutral No.
__label__anger No!
__label__non-neutral Yes!
__label__neutral Ahh.
__label__joy Oh, would you look at that Monica?
__label__joy I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
__label__anger Okay, Im next.  Dont! Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe!
__label__joy Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.
__label__anger Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!
__label__neutral Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
__label__neutral Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
__label__neutral Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.
__label__non-neutral But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
__label__non-neutral I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!
__label__non-neutral Or Friday with no two pizzas!
__label__non-neutral All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over.
__label__joy No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!
__label__non-neutral All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
__label__joy Thats right!
__label__joy Cause Im a Tribbiani!
__label__neutral And this is what we do!
__label__non-neutral I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we dont read a lot or run very fast, but damnit!
__label__joy We can eat!
__label__neutral Well?
__label__surprise Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
__label__joy Look at this!
__label__surprise Oh! You have a window!
__label__joy Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...
__label__surprise Oh look! That guy's peeing!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__non-neutral Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
__label__neutral Ohh.
__label__neutral Okay. Lets use this brush.
__label__neutral Okay. This stuff?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
__label__neutral Oke-dokey.
__label__neutral Where exactly is your zoo?
__label__neutral Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.
__label__neutral Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__neutral Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
__label__non-neutral No-no, he's, he's very docile.
__label__neutral Even if he were... cornered?
__label__neutral Well I, I don't know. Why?
__label__neutral Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
__label__non-neutral He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
__label__neutral How about a hammer, or a small blade?
__label__non-neutral Why- why- why would he need a blade?
__label__non-neutral Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something.
__label__neutral Otherwise it's just cruel.
__label__joy He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
__label__neutral We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
__label__neutral ...He's in.
__label__joy He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
__label__disgust You're making a big mistake here.
__label__neutral I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
__label__non-neutral My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.
__label__joy Really helped speed the process along!
__label__surprise Janice!
__label__surprise You're not... gone?
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__neutral Sid is still in his room.
__label__non-neutral I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him.
__label__surprise So did you do it?
__label__neutral Did you make your deposit?
__label__joy Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
__label__fear That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
__label__non-neutral I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
__label__neutral Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
__label__non-neutral Phoebe, where's your purse?
__label__non-neutral No, no! Give it to me!
__label__anger You can't have it.
__label__anger Give it to me!
__label__anger No
__label__anger I'll go in there.
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah.
__label__neutral Phoebe come here
__label__joy Haha!
__label__anger Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
__label__disgust What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
__label__neutral I just had sex.
__label__surprise Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
__label__neutral Well, you never told me how old you were.
__label__disgust Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
__label__joy I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
__label__fear Don't say it.
__label__joy ...in love with you.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__sadness Sorry.
__label__anger Well,fall out of it.
__label__anger You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night.
__label__non-neutral Oh god, oh god.
__label__disgust I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.
__label__disgust I'm Joan Collins.
__label__neutral Who?
__label__non-neutral Thats right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!
__label__neutral Uh sweetie, maybe youd be more comfortable here?
__label__anger You. Like you havent done enough.
__label__neutral Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.
__label__neutral I mean I wish I were a seahorse.
__label__neutral Because with seahorses its the male, they carry the babies.
__label__non-neutral And then also umm, Id be far away in the sea.
__label__non-neutral God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
__label__neutral Oh I know, Ive been there. I remember toward the end
__label__neutral Oh Phoebe, thats a great story.
__label__non-neutral Can you tell it to me when youre getting me some iced tea?
__label__anger Oh God, get out!
__label__anger Get out!!
__label__anger Get out!!
__label__anger Get out!
__label__anger !
__label__neutral Lets.
__label__joy All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itll be okay.
__label__fear Oh my God.Whats he gonna do now?
__label__fear I cant watch!
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__non-neutral Seriously, how can you watch this?
__label__non-neutral Arent you scared?
__label__fear Terrified.
__label__joy Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
__label__neutral Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
__label__surprise Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse?
__label__neutral Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine.
__label__neutral I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
__label__neutral Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I
__label__joy Fine! Maybe I will too!
__label__non-neutral Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
__label__non-neutral You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
__label__non-neutral MY SANDWICH?!!!
__label__anger MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
__label__neutral Whats the matter, Pheebs?
__label__non-neutral She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
__label__surprise What?!
__label__sadness Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.
__label__sadness Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is.
__label__sadness She knows, and she wont tell me.
__label__sadness Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
__label__sadness Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet.
__label__neutral Where ya going?
__label__neutral Well, shes out of town so, theres gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
__label__fear Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
__label__anger Well, are any of those people here?!
__label__surprise Oh my God, so do I!
__label__surprise I knew it, wow!!
__label__neutral Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
__label__joy Ohh, so cute.
__label__anger Uh-huh, well! But umm, still Im-Im mad at you.
__label__non-neutral I know. Im mad at me too.
__label__neutral Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? Im kinda hungry.
__label__surprise Hey! Me too!
__label__non-neutral All right, stop it. Now youre just doing it to freak me out.
__label__neutral Ok, you can do this.
__label__neutral It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.
__label__neutral Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
__label__sadness Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
__label__anger All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.
__label__surprise Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
__label__surprise Really?  My God, hes really cute.
__label__neutral Go for it.
__label__surprise Phoebe, Im engaged!
__label__neutral Im just saying, get his number just in case.
__label__neutral But no: Chandler is in an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
__label__non-neutral Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, Im engaged.
__label__disgust Well you should be embarrassed.
__label__joy I did, but that was really fun.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Chandler. I sensed it was you.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Unagi. Im always aware.
__label__non-neutral Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?
__label__neutral Whats up?
__label__neutral I cant figure out what to make Monica.
__label__non-neutral Oh, why dont you make her one of your little jokes.
__label__fear Im going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__neutral Shed-shed love this.
__label__non-neutral Uh, its an exact replica of Apollo 8.
__label__neutral I made it in the sixth grade.
__label__neutral Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
__label__neutral Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon.
__label__non-neutral But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
__label__non-neutral Wait a minute, I cant give this to her.
__label__neutral Why not?
__label__non-neutral Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
__label__neutral Yeah, see ya.
__label__joy Hey, thank you so much.
__label__non-neutral Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
__label__neutral No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
__label__anger Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
__label__neutral He might still show up.
__label__anger Oh, what are you, stupid? Its been three hours.
__label__neutral Is that all?
__label__sadness I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding?
__label__neutral Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding.
__label__neutral Um, its going to be a small ceremony.
__label__surprise Uh, tiny!
__label__neutral Were not even sure why were having it.
__label__neutral Its actually going to be just family.
__label__surprise Ohwaityou two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing
__label__neutral Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
__label__joy Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
__label__joy Oh great! What, you brought Joey?

__label__neutral Uhh.
__label__anger You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
__label__neutral Nah.
__label__fear How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape, a rapist or a killer or something!
__label__surprise Dont you think I asked him that before he got in?!
__label__anger Yknow what? Im not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!
__label__anger No!
__label__neutral Do you like car games?
__label__neutral Yeah, yknow the license plate game?

__label__non-neutral I cant figure this out!
__label__non-neutral Its so hard!
__label__non-neutral Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah!
__label__non-neutral Paper cut!
__label__neutral Now, have you told anyone else?
__label__neutral No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont want Monica to find out.
__label__surprise You told me.
__label__non-neutral Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
__label__surprise Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadnt been on the toilet.
__label__neutral Me too.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?

__label__surprise The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise The ring is gone!
__label__disgust Ugh.
__label__non-neutral Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisAh-ha-ha!!
__label__non-neutral You lost the ring!
__label__anger Youre the worst best man ever!
__label__anger Dude, this isnt funny!
__label__fear What am I gonna do?!
__label__non-neutral I go to bed last night, everythings cool!
__label__non-neutral I wake up this morning, the strippers gone and the ring is gone!
__label__surprise You slept with the stripper?
__label__non-neutral Of course!!
__label__anger What difference does that make?!
__label__non-neutral Well, I'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
__label__neutral Joey, do you have a minute?
__label__fear Dude, what am I gonna
__label__non-neutral Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
__label__fear Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
__label__neutral Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
__label__non-neutral Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have
__label__neutral What-what is it, what is it?
__label__surprise Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
__label__non-neutral Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
__label__non-neutral Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
__label__disgust I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
__label__surprise What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
__label__disgust And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
__label__non-neutral I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone
__label__anger I'm not listening to you!
__label__joy Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it!
__label__non-neutral Stick to your side!
__label__non-neutral Hey, come on now!
__label__neutral All right, what are we havin?
__label__neutral Uhh, I dont believe in these crazy diets yknow, just everything in moderation.
__label__neutral Ill take those to go.  For the kids.
__label__neutral Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
__label__non-neutral It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldnt have said.
__label__neutral But believe me, thats not gonna happen today.
__label__neutral Understood. So, whatd you say back then?
__label__neutral Well, I said that I
__label__neutral Ha!
__label__joy So you like the drums!
__label__joy That's, that's great!
__label__neutral Yknow, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation.
__label__non-neutral All right, okay, well, apparently not!
__label__joy So, yay!
__label__neutral Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four...
__label__joy Tequila!!
__label__joy That's fun.
__label__surprise Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
__label__sadness Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
__label__anger Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
__label__fear Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we just forget about it.
__label__anger Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed.
__label__neutral All right thats it, school is in session!
__label__surprise My God! Is this a gym card?
__label__neutral Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but Ive missed the last 1200 times.
__label__neutral So why dont you quit?
__label__non-neutral You dont think Ive tried? You think I
__label__neutral Who is Maria?
__label__joy Oh Maria. You cant say no to her, shes like this lycra spandex covered gymtreat.
__label__neutral You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
__label__anger No!
__label__neutral So youre strong enough to face her on your own?
__label__fear Oh no, youll have to come.
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__neutral Thank you.  Mon?
__label__neutral Hmm?
__label__neutral Pheebs, I dont think anyone's mad about that.
__label__non-neutral Exactly! Because it's in the past!
__label__neutral Anybody gonna eat that?
__label__joy Pheebs!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Listen, you know how uh, when youre wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
__label__non-neutral Yeah!
__label__surprise Well, when Jake did it I saw thathe was wearing womens underwear!
__label__neutral I know. They were mine.
__label__disgust Oh.  No! No wait, thats weird!
__label__neutral No, its not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
__label__disgust Thats weird!
__label__neutral Im wearing his briefs right now.
__label__non-neutral Thatskinda hot.
__label__joy I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
__label__neutral Yeah, I wouldnt know about that.
__label__joy And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
__label__disgust Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
__label__non-neutral There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinking even more than you.
__label__disgust Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.
__label__non-neutral Im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear!
__label__non-neutral I dont think you could ever do that.
__label__non-neutral Hey! I
__label__disgust Okay, whatever.
__label__neutral Lusts of the flesh.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral I dont know.  A cowboy theme?
__label__neutral Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
__label__joy Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it's beautiful I love it!
__label__neutral Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
__label__neutral Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my  breast?
__label__neutral It's all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but don't worry. It'll happen.
__label__surprise Yowsa!
__label__neutral Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your  mouth.
__label__non-neutral Dear Lord.
__label__neutral I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?
__label__neutral Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…
__label__non-neutral Oh look, she's pulling away again!
__label__neutral Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?
__label__neutral She looks scared.
__label__neutral Doesn't she  look scared?
__label__neutral Y'know, I don't really know her.
__label__neutral Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
__label__neutral No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
__label__neutral Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
__label__neutral Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."
__label__neutral Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
__label__non-neutral Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
__label__anger No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.
__label__non-neutral The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
__label__non-neutral Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
__label__neutral Pathetic mess?
__label__neutral I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.
__label__joy I'm thinkin', cha-ching!
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__neutral Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice.
__label__neutral You're doin' this.
__label__neutral Hi. She said yes.
__label__joy Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?
__label__joy "Happy birthday to you!"
__label__neutral Youre paying for that.
__label__surprise What? No-no its her birthday!
__label__surprise Youve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
__label__neutral But it really
__label__neutral You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
__label__anger Damnit!
__label__joy Rach? Hi!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
__label__neutral Well yeah
__label__surprise Oh wow!
__label__surprise I mean, wow!
__label__non-neutral I mean, I-I-I think shes cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
__label__neutral Oh so-so not really never.
__label__neutral I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.
__label__neutral I mean after all weve been through, I justyknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.
__label__neutral Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
__label__non-neutral Oh-ho, and mine!
__label__non-neutral Okay, sono toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
__label__fear No-no wait-wait! I cant just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
__label__neutral WellI only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.
__label__non-neutral Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
__label__sadness Its just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
__label__neutral Chandler?
__label__non-neutral I-Im sorry?
__label__non-neutral No look, I-Im sure that people know you exist!
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah?
__label__neutral I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.
__label__sadness Ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk.
__label__neutral Hang-hang on.
__label__neutral Hey everybody!
__label__sadness Uh, Im gonna kill myself!
__label__neutral Ill get back to ya.
__label__neutral I got nothing.
__label__neutral Wait.
__label__neutral Uh, hey Marge!
__label__neutral Ehh, nothing.
__label__non-neutral Nothing.
__label__surprise Apparently, theres like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and theres only this one robot and this one guy who controls it!
__label__surprise I didnt know he could get me fired!
__label__fear What am I going to do?
__label__neutral Well yknow Joey, youre a pretty charming guy.
__label__fear Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
__label__neutral No sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! Youve got to kiss some serious robot ass!
__label__neutral Thats not a bad idea.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.
__label__joy Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
__label__neutral So do you think uh, Joeys more charming than me?
__label__non-neutral Yeah! Thats why Im sleeping with him on the side.
__label__neutral Yeah, you wish.
__label__non-neutral "You wish."
__label__non-neutral Why are you yelling?
__label__non-neutral Whoa, that
__label__surprise Whoa-whoa, what is it?
__label__neutral Well Its a date.
__label__surprise A date?!
__label__surprise No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldnt schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
__label__sadness Come on Joey, dont make me feel badly about this.
__label__anger No, Im gonna!!
__label__anger Thats right!
__label__anger Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin out with that girl!
__label__anger Like-like-like I did something terrible to you!
__label__anger And now Pheebs, youre doing the same thing!
__label__anger ThatIts not the same thing! This is
__label__anger Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
__label__surprise She was?
__label__anger Well, she graduated from high school!
__label__non-neutral Okay, whatever.

__label__anger Yeah!
__label__anger Fine!
__label__anger Yeah!

__label__anger No! You let go!
__label__anger No!
__label__non-neutral How come its always us left in the field holding the ball?

__label__non-neutral I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
__label__non-neutral And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
__label__neutral Listen, Roberts gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
__label__non-neutral Oh.
__label__fear Please, right now, no, every time I see him its like Is it on the lose? Is it watching me?
__label__non-neutral We cant tell him, you cant go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
__label__neutral Hes right, even if its to say something complementary.
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral So are ready for the gym? Theyve got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.
__label__neutral No, I can spot you from here.

__label__neutral Which you just gave up really quickly.
__label__neutral Have you seen Joey?
__label__neutral Whats the matter?
__label__neutral Oh, just this!  Yknow what its my fault really, because the couch is usually where we

__label__non-neutral Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
__label__neutral Can I help you?
__label__fear Uh-oh.
__label__neutral Uh, y'know what, were having second thoughts about our copying needs. And well need a little more time to think about it.
__label__neutral Chloe, switch with me, theres some guys here that got a crush on you.
__label__non-neutral Okay, that hurt us.
__label__neutral Hi guys. I havent seen you since this morning.
__label__neutral Well ah, ........y'know.

__label__non-neutral Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
__label__neutral Yeah, well.
__label__neutral Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
__label__joy Oh yeah, Id love that.
__label__joy Oh, great! Me too.
__label__neutral I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
__label__neutral And why do you care so much?
__label__joy Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
__label__non-neutral You had fantasies about Emily?
__label__neutral No! Yknow,
__label__neutral Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
__label__non-neutral Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
__label__neutral Ahh.
__label__neutral Do you love her?
__label__neutral We said it was only going to be two weeks, yknow?
__label__surprise You love her!
__label__neutral What-what is love really?
__label__neutral Ohhh, I
__label__neutral I am a good kisser.
__label__neutral Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in  Ive been watching too much porn.
__label__neutral So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
__label__joy Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I
__label__neutral Why dont we do a trial run.
__label__neutral Oh okay. Umm, all right.  Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?

__label__neutral Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
__label__neutral Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
__label__non-neutral Well, its just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
__label__non-neutral Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could justthrow your purses at it.
__label__neutral Bloomingdales
__label__surprise Oh my God, are you out of a job?
__label__sadness No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a

__label__non-neutral All right, umm, were not gonna really keep it this way though.
__label__surprise No?
__label__neutral No, were gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__neutral And also, we dont know what to do with this.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
__label__non-neutral You dont know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
__label__non-neutral All right! Ross, do you think its easy for me to see you with somebody else?
__label__anger Y'know, hey! Youre the one who ended it, remember?

__label__non-neutral Noo!
__label__surprise Maybe!
__label__neutral I, I dont know.
__label__non-neutral Ross, I still cant forgive you for what you did, I cant, I just, but sometimes when Im with you I just, I feel so...
__label__non-neutral What?!
__label__neutral I just, I feel, I-I just...
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral I feel...
__label__anger Noo!! I dont care! Im not, Im not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!

__label__neutral Gnight.
__label__non-neutral Wanna play strip poker for practice?
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral The keys stuck in the lock.
__label__neutral I can fix it. Hold on.  Look out. Look out.
__label__non-neutral It still doesnt work.
__label__neutral Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
__label__joy Isnt it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin married.
__label__joy I know, theyre gonna be
__label__joy Ohh I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
__label__neutral Not
__label__joy No! Im so happy for them!
__label__joy Me too! So happy for them!
__label__non-neutral Im so happy and not at all jealous.
__label__non-neutral Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
__label__neutral I mean Im probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean whats 2%? Thats nothing.

__label__non-neutral Yeah me too.

__label__neutral Phoebe hes right, that is the rule.
__label__anger I dont accept this rule.
__label__anger When we make plans, I expect you to show up.
__label__anger Okay, I cant just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better!
__label__anger Yknow boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!

__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__non-neutral And I feel like Ive conquered the business world, and I feel like Ive conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
__label__surprise Wow.
__label__sadness Theres one thing missing.
__label__neutral Whats that?
__label__neutral Its time for me to conquer the physical world.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Monica, I want to become  the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
__label__surprise You wanna what?!
__label__joy I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! Its the most intense physical competition in the world, its banned in 49 states!
__label__surprise What are you talking about?
__label__neutral Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, Ive even had my own octagon training ring designed.
__label__non-neutral And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win.
__label__joy I want you close enough to smell the blood.
__label__neutral What do you think?
__label__disgust My parents will be so happy.
__label__neutral Okay to come in?

__label__neutral Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral Im the ruptured spleen.
__label__non-neutral Why would you do that?
__label__non-neutral Because you shouldnt be with him.  You should be with me.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__non-neutral Yeah!
__label__sadness When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!
__label__non-neutral Look, things like last night they dont just happen.
__label__non-neutral Yknow?
__label__non-neutral Or at least not to me.
__label__non-neutral Or with the other two women, in the morning yknow I was just lying there and I couldnt wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yknow with a friend.
__label__surprise Chandler!
__label__sadness I know you probably dont want to go out with me, yknow because I make too many jokes and Ive never been in a serious relationship and I guess Im not technically a "doctor"
__label__neutral There was just one woman, wasnt there?
__label__neutral No, there were two.
__label__surprise Including me?
__label__joy Oh yeah.
__label__joy Hey!

__label__surprise Either that or shes just the best, most expensive date I ever had.
__label__sadness Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
__label__neutral Im your mother.
__label__surprise Ehh?
__label__neutral Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldnt go out with a guy like Chandler...
__label__neutral Hi there.
__label__neutral ...and he couldnt let it go, and... I dont really know what happened with that either.
__label__surprise Oh-oh!
__label__neutral And then Rosss new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head.
__label__neutral And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I dont know what happened there either...
__label__neutral Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler.
__label__neutral Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
__label__sadness Well yeah, I lied before.

__label__neutral Sorry.
__label__neutral What happened?
__label__neutral Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.

__label__neutral You mean Dr. Geller?
__label__surprise Doctor? Wow! I didnt know he had a nickname.
__label__neutral Oh, he wont sit here.
__label__neutral Only the people in the white coats sit over there,  and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, it mustve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__sadness Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
__label__neutral Oh yeah man.  Joey.
__label__neutral Hey.

__label__joy I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
__label__neutral Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.

__label__non-neutral You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
__label__disgust Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
__label__non-neutral Oh God!
__label__neutral So, how many have you sold so far?
__label__surprise Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
__label__surprise Oh my God, how did you do that?
__label__joy Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as Laser Floyd was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!
__label__joy Thats when it occurred to me, the key to my success, the munchies. So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight.
__label__joy I am selling cookies by the case.
__label__joy They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'
__label__neutral Okay, stop what youre doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....

__label__surprise The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
__label__non-neutral No you didnt.
__label__surprise Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said
__label__neutral Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check.
__label__neutral And then you said, "Why do they call it a check?
__label__neutral Why not a Yugoslavian?"
__label__neutral Yeah, then you did that.
__label__surprise So you dont have the cameras?!
__label__sadness No. Sorry man.
__label__non-neutral So? What? What? Theyre gone! Monicas gonna freak!
__label__neutral Well, Im sure theyre still somewhere here in the hotel. Ill-Ill help you look for them.
__label__non-neutral Great.

__label__neutral See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually.
__label__neutral Its-its, theyre-theyre wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at
__label__neutral Maybe in L.A?
__label__joy Yes!
__label__neutral There you go.
__label__neutral So, have you kids eaten yet?
__label__neutral Well, we were going to do that afterI mean umm, next.

__label__neutral So We go eat.
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__neutral Youll wear that. Well be eating, and of course, youll be wearing that.
__label__neutral Well I guess I shouldve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__non-neutral Yep! Looks like its gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.

__label__joy Yknow what? Youre just upset because youre losing.
__label__non-neutral Oh come on Ross, I think were all losers here.
__label__neutral All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
__label__anger Let me think. Let me thinkOh! I dont care.
__label__neutral You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
__label__neutral Either, it makes no difference.
__label__anger Choose, you jackass!
__label__neutral Ill take a card.
__label__joy Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Rosss points!
__label__surprise What?!
__label__joy This game is kinda fun.
__label__non-neutral You dont think its a little crazy that you get all my points just cause you
__label__neutral I dont think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
__label__surprise Hello?  Oh, hi Ross!  See? Other people call me!
__label__joy Very funny Ross!
__label__neutral Very life-like and funny.
__label__neutral Okay.

__label__anger Oh? Really? Thats what my daughter means to you? Nothing?
__label__fear No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I careI-I love Rachel.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral Oh but not that way. I meanI mean Im not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.

__label__neutral Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
__label__neutral All right, bye-bye.
__label__neutral Okay, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
__label__neutral We'll give you Janice.
__label__neutral I miss Janice though.  "Hello, Chandler Bing."
__label__surprise "Oh, my, god."
__label__joy "Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
__label__neutral Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
__label__joy We won. We won!
__label__neutral Mr. Heckles.
__label__neutral How did this happen?
__label__neutral He musta been sweeping. They found a broom in his hand.
__label__non-neutral That's terrible.
__label__neutral I know. I was sweeping yesterday. It coulda been me.
__label__neutral Sure, you coulda. You never know.
__label__neutral You never know.
__label__sadness Oh, I'm sorry.
__label__neutral Where's Chandler?
__label__neutral Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
__label__joy I'm free! I'm free!
__label__neutral That oughta do it.
__label__non-neutral Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
__label__surprise Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
__label__neutral Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
__label__surprise I didn't know there were docks.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__sadness Aww, is it broken?
__label__non-neutral No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
__label__neutral Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
__label__non-neutral Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
__label__non-neutral Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
__label__surprise What is this? Fruit?
__label__neutral Monica's making jam.
__label__joy Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
__label__neutral Because the kids need new shoes.
__label__neutral I'm going into business people.
__label__non-neutral I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard.
__label__non-neutral I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.
__label__neutral What's the opposite of man?
__label__neutral Jam.
__label__fear Oh Joey don't!
__label__non-neutral It's way to hot.
__label__neutral This will just be my batch.
__label__non-neutral Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
__label__surprise Why? Do you think hes still mad at us?
__label__neutral Well hes probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
__label__surprise What? Mine arent tinted.
__label__neutral Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
__label__neutral I will have one.
__label__neutral Okay, Im not gonna have one.
__label__neutral Neither will I.
__label__non-neutral No, no, its just my tooth.
__label__neutral All right Ill have one.
__label__neutral So whats a matter, you need a dentist? Ive got a good one.
__label__fear No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him.
__label__neutral See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
__label__surprise Why? Why cant you go to him?
__label__non-neutral Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
__label__joy That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienists blouse.
__label__surprise Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob.
__label__surprise And all these people actually died?
__label__non-neutral Yes, while I was in the chair!
__label__neutral Thats why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, its not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
__label__neutral Pheebs, come on, you didnt kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.
__label__neutral Its, its, its just ah, a coincidence.
__label__non-neutral Well tell that to them. Oh! You cant, their dead.
__label__surprise Hello?
__label__neutral Ross.
__label__non-neutral Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
__label__sadness It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
__label__joy No, no, that-that, thats all right. Umm, Im just glad you called.
__label__non-neutral Ross umm, theres something that Ive got to tell you, theres-theres someone else.
__label__non-neutral Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
__label__non-neutral You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
__label__sadness Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
__label__neutral So, let's go.
__label__neutral Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
__label__neutral Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.
__label__neutral You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
__label__neutral Okay, Ive got three of my five.
__label__neutral Three of your five, what?
__label__neutral Celebrities Im allowed to sleep with.
__label__surprise Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
__label__neutral Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left.
__label__neutral All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
__label__joy Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
__label__surprise Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
__label__neutral Susan Sarandon.
__label__disgust Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
__label__joy And!! Isabella Rosselini.
__label__joy Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around.
__label__neutral So?
__label__neutral So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time.
__label__neutral Yeah, cause thats why you wont get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
__label__non-neutral Oh thats five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesnt she want to come out?
__label__neutral Yknow what I think it is?
__label__neutral I think youve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesnt want to leave.
__label__non-neutral Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
__label__neutral Twenty-one hours, youre a hero.
__label__non-neutral Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
__label__neutral Actually, I think youre ready to go to the delivery room.
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral Ten centimeters, youre about to become a mom.
__label__surprise My God. Okay.  Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
__label__neutral Are they here yet?
__label__neutral No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral May I see your boarding pass?
__label__neutral Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
__label__neutral Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
__label__neutral No, I know, but Ihe just went on.
__label__non-neutral He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
__label__anger No no no! Federal regulations!
__label__neutral OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is
__label__neutral Alright. What's the message?
__label__neutral Uh... I don't know.
__label__neutral Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
__label__surprise : Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about!
__label__anger There's no Rachel!
__label__non-neutral Don't give me that deep freeze.
__label__neutral Here's the thing, Janice.
__label__neutral You know, I mean, it's like we're different.
__label__non-neutral I'm like the bing, bing, bing.
__label__neutral You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
__label__surprise Ow!
__label__non-neutral Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
__label__non-neutral Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
__label__non-neutral I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
__label__surprise Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?
__label__non-neutral Oh, I don't know, a million?
__label__neutral Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
__label__neutral I'm fine.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__fear I'm not fine. Here she comes.
__label__neutral Wait here. Breathe.
__label__surprise How do you do that?
__label__neutral It's like a gift.
__label__neutral We should always always break up together.
__label__neutral Oh, I'd like that.
__label__non-neutral You win.
__label__neutral Well, what did you have?
__label__non-neutral It doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six.
__label__neutral That my friend is D-Cup.
__label__neutral Okay, now much have you won so far?
__label__surprise Uh,  wow, 700.
__label__surprise Not 700 exactly?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral Double it!
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Hey, I didnt make up the rules.
__label__neutral Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card.
__label__neutral Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.
__label__surprise Dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getNo way!
__label__sadness Im, Im sorry you didnt get to go to Spacecamp, and Im hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it.

__label__sadness In that, um, they don't.
__label__surprise Oh. They don't.
__label__non-neutral But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see.
__label__sadness They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff.
__label__non-neutral They just think you're a little...
__label__non-neutral What?

__label__non-neutral I mean youre not the only ones on your honeymoon!
__label__neutral Well you can have the suite if you want.
__label__neutral We dont care about where we stay.
__label__non-neutral Were here to celebrate our love together.
__label__non-neutral We dont have to get free stuff.
__label__non-neutral We just want to be together.
__label__neutral We need the stuff.
__label__joy Yes!
__label__neutral Okay, well then how about a handshake?
__label__non-neutral Oh God I'm sorry!
__label__non-neutral Oh God, I'm sorry!

__label__neutral Okay, that-thats all for today.
__label__neutral Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
__label__neutral Yeah, its the new building on Avenue A.

__label__sadness I cant do this.
__label__non-neutral Yep. Yep, thats what I didnt want to know.
__label__sadness Well, oh, Mark, Im doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?
__label__non-neutral Im just doing it to get back at Ross.
__label__sadness Im sorry, its not very fair to you.
__label__surprise Ahh!

__label__disgust I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh.
__label__non-neutral Yknow it wouldnt kill ya to respect your wifes privacy!
__label__anger Stupid closet full of bugs!
__label__fear Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I dontWhoa!!

__label__neutral No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
__label__non-neutral Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
__label__disgust OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
__label__neutral More than jewelry.
__label__neutral Hi! Im Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
__label__surprise Really? Ive been dealing with Dr. Wells.
__label__neutral I know, but Im a neurologist.
__label__neutral And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
__label__surprise Dr. Wells is a woman.
__label__neutral That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.
__label__neutral Clifford Burnett.
__label__neutral Date of birth?
__label__neutral November 16
__label__neutral Age?
__label__non-neutral Cant you figure that out based on my date of birth?
__label__neutral Im a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
__label__neutral Im 33.
__label__neutral Okay. And uh, are you married.
__label__neutral No.
__label__surprise Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
__label__surprise Are all the questions this personal?
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__sadness Well uh if you must know Im a widower.
__label__sadness Oh thats terrible. Im-Im really sorry.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?
__label__joy Hey! You guys, Im writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
__label__joy Pheebs, thats great!
__label__joy Oh, yay!
__label__neutral But yknow umm, Rachel doesnt rhyme with draddle.
__label__disgust I know but its so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
__label__neutral What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
__label__neutral All good, thanks.  Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname thats easier to rhyme?
__label__neutral Didnt your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay, I can do this.
__label__neutral I can tell her how I feel.
__label__fear Just uh, just stand up straight.
__label__fear Take a couple deep breaths.
__label__fear Look confident.
__label__neutral Joey? Whats up?
__label__fear I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
__label__neutral Okay whats up?
__label__neutral What I do dois manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
__label__neutral I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
__label__neutral Hardest thing Ive ever done in my life.
__label__neutral You gotta go!
__label__neutral Oh!
__label__neutral Okay, dont worry. Youre ready.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and youll be great.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really.
__label__neutral Yeah, Ross is great.
__label__neutral He's uh, he's in a whole other place.
__label__neutral No, he's gone.
__label__neutral No no, you don't have to fly back, really.
__label__surprise What do you mean this might be your only chance?
__label__anger Would you stop?
__label__non-neutral I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
__label__neutral Where have you been?
__label__joy Oh, just had a baby.
__label__joy Mazel tov!
__label__joy Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
__label__surprise Oh yeah! With who?
__label__neutral You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Not her.
__label__neutral Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I cant decide between the two of them.
__label__neutral Yknow the one from Poughkeepsie, even though shes a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun.
__label__neutral But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown.
__label__neutral Yknow shes, well shes-shes just as pretty, I guess shes smart, shes
__label__neutral If shes no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
__label__neutral Well, I-I want to give her another chance, yknow?
__label__neutral She lives so close.
__label__neutral And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasif she was kidding was very funny.
__label__non-neutral On the other hand, if she wasnt kidding, shes not fun, shes stupid, and kind of a racist.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hey, man!
__label__joy Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
__label__non-neutral Damn!
__label__neutral Oh heres a whole bunch.
__label__neutral Oh, I mean shes gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl."
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__sadness Then shell have to come back here and live all alone.
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and its positive. Monicas pregnant.  So I guess she wont be totally alone.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__sadness Listen, Im sorry about that whole thing with Roger.
__label__non-neutral It really wasnt right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think youll really enjoy.
__label__neutral Now, this is just a loan.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral Im gonna, Im gonna want him back.
__label__neutral So  Im gonna go now.
__label__sadness Im sorry, I thought I could do it and I cant!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__non-neutral All right, well why dont I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
__label__neutral Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
__label__neutral All right ladies, heres what were gonna do.
__label__non-neutral I-I wanna be with her,  I like her.
__label__non-neutral Oh, thats fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
__label__surprise Wait, now, what am I doing again?
__label__anger Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
__label__neutral Hi, Im Joshua, Im here to pick up Rachel.
__label__anger No-no-no, that not Joshua.
__label__non-neutral What do you want from me, Ive never met the guy.
__label__sadness So anyway, Rachel, Im sorry you cant stay,  but the rest of us have a
__label__neutral How do I look?
__label__neutral Oh, uh, I... don't... care.
__label__neutral Ok, now, remember, no trading.
__label__neutral You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
__label__joy Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
__label__neutral ...And what did you bring?
__label__neutral She's checking the coats.
__label__neutral Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands.
__label__neutral Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
__label__surprise Janice?
__label__surprise Oh.... my.... God.
__label__non-neutral Hey, it's Janice.
__label__non-neutral Well, okay so, I dont have it all worked out quite yet. Just dont say anything to Rachel, please?
__label__neutral Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
__label__non-neutral Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
__label__non-neutral Hey Rach!
__label__surprise What was that?!
__label__neutral Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
__label__neutral I havent seen it yet!
__label__non-neutral Well then youd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
__label__anger Noooooooo!!
__label__joy Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
__label__neutral Uh, okay, Pheebs?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__joy All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
__label__non-neutral Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
__label__joy Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
__label__joy Yeah, all of us! All day!
__label__disgust That sucks!
__label__non-neutral That's not a trip!
__label__non-neutral I just came from the park!
__label__non-neutral What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park?
__label__non-neutral "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
__label__non-neutral Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
__label__surprise Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!!
__label__surprise Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey!
__label__anger Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I justy'knowstop it!
__label__non-neutral I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
__label__disgust That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
__label__disgust Makes me wanna puke!
__label__neutral Is she in there?
__label__neutral Yeah. Shes putting her down now, thats her.
__label__neutral Oh its all right.
__label__sadness Im guess Im just done with the whole dating thing.
__label__sadness Its one more thing in my life thats suddenly completely different.
__label__sadness This is hard.
__label__neutral Yeah I know.
__label__neutral On the other hand in um, in about seven months youre gonna have something that youre gonna love more than any guy youve ever gone out with.
__label__neutral Just wait.
__label__joy Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger.
__label__joy You have no idea.
__label__neutral Thanks sweetie.
__label__neutral You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?
__label__sadness Oh no, I think Im gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
__label__non-neutral Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
__label__neutral Oh you did, there are twenty in here.
__label__neutral Right. Good night.
__label__neutral Good night.
__label__neutral Hi
__label__joy Hi!  Hey mom.
__label__joy This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
__label__surprise Jack?
__label__surprise Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?
__label__neutral Thats a good question, dad. Thats a good question
__label__neutral Hmmm.
__label__joy Congratulations you two!
__label__joy Thank youwere so excited
__label__joy And also, congratulations on your wedding.
__label__surprise WhaWhat?
__label__non-neutral Look at this clown!
__label__disgust Just because hes got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.
__label__anger Get out of the way jackass!
__label__disgust Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?
__label__neutral That
__label__surprise What are they doing out here? The coasts all the way over there.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__surprise Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
__label__non-neutral Dude! What are yoyou trying to kill me?!
__label__non-neutral Ow!
__label__neutral Really?! Well, its just like everyone elses apartment. Its got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
__label__neutral Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Oh my God!
__label__neutral Ah well, this is the living room.
__label__neutral Impressive.
__label__neutral All right. This is the kitchen.
__label__non-neutral Oh, thats real pretty. Wait a minute, dont I get to see the bedroom?
__label__neutral The bedroom. Well its pretty much your typical...  bedroom.
__label__neutral Were still on this side of the door.
__label__neutral Um-hmm.
__label__sadness Yeah, but I didnt get to see it.
__label__neutral Oh shoot! Maybe next time.  Thanks for a lovely evening.
__label__non-neutral So um, who was she?
__label__neutral Oh,  that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
__label__neutral Did you like her? And Im just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
__label__neutral Well, you seem fine.
__label__neutral Well, I dont think this, y'know.
__label__disgust No, no, no, I wouldnt do you myself, I mean that would be weird.
__label__neutral Yeah, no, Ill get one of the other girls to do it.
__label__joy Oh, this will be so much fun!
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__joy Are you excited?
__label__neutral Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
__label__neutral Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
__label__neutral All I have is, is oregano and a
__label__joy Um, that's ok!  Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
__label__neutral Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
__label__neutral Can we just start throwing things in?
__label__neutral Ok, yeah, ok.  Oh, OK.
__label__neutral Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
__label__neutral Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
__label__non-neutral Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
__label__surprise Hey he's wearing a sweater.
__label__neutral No.
__label__disgust Eww!
__label__neutral And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
__label__neutral Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
__label__neutral Mona?  Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be?
__label__sadness I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
__label__neutral Oh, its okay.
__label__non-neutral No, its still wet.
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__neutral Let me get it out before it sets.
__label__neutral Ooh, I have something you can wear.
__label__neutral Here.
__label__non-neutral Oh umm, I-I dont know if I want to wear a womans shirt.
__label__neutral No-no thats a mans shirt.
__label__neutral Its awfully pink.
__label__joy Oh, it's perfect!
__label__neutral How about you?
__label__neutral It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
__label__neutral All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
__label__disgust We are bad people.
__label__surprise He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew!  You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Lets get the show on it!
__label__neutral Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
__label__neutral Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and its sooo close.
__label__neutral Closer than here?
__label__non-neutral Oh, hey, look, I found coffee!  Okay, lets skedaddle.
__label__neutral Wait, Im not just gonna drink somebodys old coffee.
__label__neutral Okay, your highness.
__label__surprise Um, Rachel Im really sorry.  Thats okay, do you wanna get back together?  Yeah, okay.  Did anyone else hear that?!
__label__surprise So how did you know I was even here?
__label__neutral Your mom called me. So is this her?
__label__neutral No, this is a loaner.
__label__neutral I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
__label__neutral I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game?
__label__neutral Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
__label__neutral Yeah, they're not so bad.
__label__neutral Im sorry I wont be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but Im
__label__non-neutral I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didnt want him to start yelling at me like I was some 74 Latour.
__label__non-neutral Its Lafite. The 74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
__label__fear All right here he comes. Im gonna do this, Im gonna tell him, Im gonna be strong.
__label__neutral I just called a friend of mine.
__label__surprise Yeah?
__label__neutral I think I may be able to book
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__non-neutral What is it sweetie?
__label__sadness Theres not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__sadness Im sorry daddy.
__label__non-neutral I dont believe this!!
__label__fear Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
__label__anger Stay calm?!!
__label__anger How do you expect me to stay calm?!
__label__anger This is unacceptable Rachel!
__label__anger And I wanna know why?!!
__label__anger Is it because that punk Ross wont marry you?!
__label__non-neutral Thats it!
__label__anger Is that it?
__label__non-neutral !
__label__sadness Yes. Yes, he says Im damaged goods.
__label__surprise So, youre like a zillionaire?
__label__surprise And youre our age. Youre our age.
__label__neutral Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
__label__neutral What like Pete Dakota?
__label__neutral Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
__label__neutral Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
__label__neutral Thats not a state Joe.
__label__neutral Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
__label__neutral I got to go, so ah, Ill see you guys later.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__surprise Youre our age!
__label__neutral So ah, we on for tomorrow?
__label__joy Absolutely!
__label__joy Now get out of here you!!
__label__non-neutral Okay, Im running out of places I can touch him!
__label__sadness Look, is there something wrong with me?
__label__sadness I mean why am I only attracted to guys where theres no future?
__label__sadness Either theyre too old, or theyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me, and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on!
__label__sadness I mean, seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me?
__label__neutral !
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Okay, Im gonna go get Frank.
__label__neutral So, were walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, Hey, lets go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes, remember?
__label__non-neutral And then, and then, you turn to me and say, Nah, lets just hang out at your place. Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
__label__neutral Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
__label__anger You know what else Im not gonna miss?
__label__anger "Im Monica.
__label__anger I wash the toilet 17 times a day.
__label__anger Even if people are on it!"
__label__anger "Hi Im Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, Id better wash it and shrink it!"
__label__anger "Im Monica, I dont get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
__label__non-neutral Hey! I call her!
__label__anger "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
__label__anger "Oh my God, I cant find a boyfriend!
__label__anger So I guess Ill just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
__label__neutral Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
__label__neutral Item J437-A, color: winterberry.
__label__neutral Hi umm, listen come here, come in.
__label__sadness Im so-so sorry about yesterday.
__label__sadness I-Im really sorry.
__label__non-neutral Its just that I
__label__neutral Listen Ross, you dont have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
__label__surprise You do?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, you still have feelings for me.
__label__joy And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you.
__label__sadness And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we cant.
__label__sadness Its too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasnt meant to be.
__label__non-neutral Oh God youre right.
__label__sadness Ross, wewe have to be strong. Okay, I-Im gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Im telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
__label__neutral Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I dont want to make it savory.
__label__neutral Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
__label__neutral Gimme this.
__label__neutral Hi! Okay, dont be mad at me, but I couldnt resist.
__label__surprise Brides magazines?
__label__neutral Yes, and I know that youd say no if he asked you, but Im sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
__label__non-neutral Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.
__label__non-neutral It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.
__label__non-neutral I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean I cant.
__label__non-neutral Right?
__label__non-neutral I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral I know.  I need more pie.
__label__neutral Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
__label__surprise You didnt break up with that fireman?
__label__neutral No, that was my way of telling you.
__label__neutral Well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.
__label__neutral He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
__label__surprise Wow!
__label__neutral Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
__label__neutral So then, are you going to dump Jason?
__label__neutral Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now sos Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?
__label__neutral So Its really just about the math.
__label__neutral Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
__label__anger Ok, look! Enough is enough!
__label__non-neutral No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
__label__neutral Monica, that was also true an
__label__non-neutral I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
__label__neutral But...
__label__non-neutral Look!
__label__neutral You knew this about me when you married me!
__label__neutral You agreed to take me in sickness and in health.
__label__non-neutral Well, this is my sickness!
__label__neutral Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
__label__neutral Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
__label__neutral Yeah me too, all night.
__label__surprise Really?! How come we didnt cross paths?
__label__neutral Yeah well thats because uhI stayed in my room. Yeah, you dont want to look in my hamper.
__label__surprise I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there!
__label__surprise Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker
__label__neutral Yeah, okay lets leave these two alone.
__label__disgust No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
__label__non-neutral Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
__label__neutral So.
__label__neutral So.
__label__neutral I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.
__label__neutral I mean, you know, we've never really talked.
__label__neutral I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
__label__fear I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
__label__surprise Really? Me?
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__surprise Oh my god, are you kidding?
__label__non-neutral Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
__label__neutral Well, you're not totally paranoid.
__label__non-neutral Oy.
__label__non-neutral Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
__label__neutral Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
__label__joy Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
__label__neutral I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
__label__neutral All right, Julie.
__label__neutral Bye.
__label__disgust Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.
__label__joy Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
__label__neutral Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with the one I picked first.
__label__anger Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over!
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
__label__surprise They put you in jail?
__label__non-neutral The little jail between the doors!
__label__anger Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
__label__non-neutral I know, Im sorry! But yknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
__label__non-neutral Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
__label__neutral Maybe it was the guy.
__label__non-neutral It was the ring!
__label__neutral No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
__label__neutral Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
__label__non-neutral No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
__label__neutral Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
__label__neutral Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend.
__label__surprise Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
__label__joy We can, we can go to Aruba!
__label__sadness When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.
__label__sadness You would've liked it.
__label__neutral I had a bra.
__label__neutral Hey, Dr. Farber.
__label__neutral All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
__label__surprise Oh my God! What does
__label__neutral Oh that's an eye removal machine.
__label__non-neutral All right, I'm outta here!
__label__joy I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral So were done then!
__label__neutral Almost! But first, we gotta start.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral This is a glaucoma test.
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__neutral Sit down.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral A small puff of air, now come on!
__label__fear Sure, now Im scared.
__label__neutral No, we can go together! Just dont wait too long though, okay? Cause Im outta here sometime before Friday.
__label__fear Yeah, but I dont wanna die!
__label__joy No-no, itll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
__label__neutral Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
__label__neutral Oh, hey.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Youve have lipstick right here . Thats okay, its mine, we just kissed.
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
__label__neutral No. Y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail.
__label__non-neutral Yeah!
__label__neutral Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
__label__surprise Youre building a post office?
__label__neutral No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. Its a one day job, max.
__label__surprise Okay.  My word! Those are snug.
__label__neutral Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valentes.
__label__neutral Power saw kinda got away from me there.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__non-neutral Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
__label__neutral So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?
__label__sadness I cant seem to say goodbye.
__label__surprise Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
__label__non-neutral Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
__label__neutral It was cheesecake.
__label__neutral It was fine.
__label__surprise It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  Wow!
__label__joy My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
__label__non-neutral Yknow what? Forget it!
__label__neutral Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted.
__label__neutral Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
__label__neutral Mommas Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
__label__neutral This ones from me.
__label__surprise Ahh!
__label__neutral It wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its really fun.
__label__surprise A scooter!
__label__neutral Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
__label__joy No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
__label__joy Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys?
__label__neutral For my last birthday you gave me a
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__joy Happy birthday Grandma!
__label__neutral Its better to be over the hill  then buried under it.
__label__neutral All our love Monica and Chandler.
__label__joy Thats funny, yeah!
__label__surprise No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
__label__joy No, I know! I get it! Its funny!
__label__non-neutral No, because youre not a grandmother!
__label__non-neutral No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I dont have any of those things.
__label__neutral Thats why its so funny.
__label__non-neutral All you had to do was buy the card!
__label__neutral Hey, Joey. What's going on?
__label__neutral Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
__label__non-neutral Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
__label__non-neutral Sorry. Wrong boobies.
__label__neutral Hello, Joey.
__label__non-neutral Oh! ...Hello, dear.
__label__surprise Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
__label__joy I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
__label__surprise Really?
__label__disgust No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
__label__neutral Hey, buddy.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Oh, that's attractive.
__label__non-neutral Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
__label__disgust Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
__label__neutral Oh, ah- the kid has it.
__label__anger The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
__label__neutral You gotta do it, man.
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatevercan't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
__label__anger 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
__label__anger Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
__label__anger GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
__label__anger ...Now
__label__joy Oh, look, wish me luck!
__label__neutral What for?
__label__neutral I'm gonna go get one of those  job things.
__label__neutral Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. Thats good right?
__label__non-neutral You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
__label__surprise What? Hes gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Im so glad you could make it.
__label__non-neutral Yes, thank you so much. And again, were so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
__label__non-neutral Try. Theres my little girl.
__label__neutral Shes still mad.
__label__joy Yeah I know. Isnt it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
__label__surprise Phoebe, Sandras mad at you too. It-it doesnt bother you?
__label__neutral Oh, thats veryReally very-very okay.
__label__joy Julies cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, thats about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
__label__neutral Have you felt Rachels cervix Ross?
__label__disgust No, I dont think well be doing that.
__label__disgust Were not gonna do that.
__label__neutral Well, if you like you can feel Rachels and then feel mine to compare.
__label__neutral Am I interrupting?
__label__joy Uh yes! Thank you.
__label__neutral Oh. Oh wait no.
__label__neutral Later.
__label__non-neutral No-no-dont! Dont leave me here with these people.
__label__neutral Oh uh, Im sorry.
__label__fear No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
__label__neutral Try feeding her again.
__label__neutral I already fed her.
__label__non-neutral I know, that's why I said again!
__label__fear Alright you guys, we can't turn on each other, Okay?   That's just what she wants.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral Phoebe! Rachel! Its Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.
__label__sadness Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
__label__non-neutral For what?
__label__sadness Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
__label__neutral And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
__label__surprise You al-you already had it?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
__label__sadness Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you dont have either.
__label__sadness We ruined everything.
__label__sadness Ugh
__label__non-neutral Well no, wait a minute, thats not true!
__label__joy No, what did, that was really sweet.
__label__joy And it kinda works out for the best.
__label__surprise What do you, what do you mean?
__label__joy Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!
__label__joy I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I dont even like!
__label__non-neutral Surprise
__label__non-neutral Sur-surprise.
__label__neutral Monica.
__label__non-neutral I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
__label__neutral Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.
__label__neutral Not you guys.
__label__joy You got it going on!
__label__neutral So, what are we gonna do today?
__label__neutral They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
__label__non-neutral Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
__label__non-neutral I don't think so!
__label__neutral Why not?
__label__neutral Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
__label__non-neutral I'm not always that bad!
__label__neutral Oh,
__label__surprise I punched you...?
__label__surprise And...?
__label__surprise ... Phoebe...?
__label__neutral ... and...?
__label__non-neutral I clunked your heads together!
__label__sadness Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
__label__neutral Oh, thats okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__sadness I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a fire.
__label__surprise What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?!
__label__neutral Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.
__label__fear All right. Did everyone get out okay?
__label__neutral Well, the giraffes okay. And so is the pirate.
__label__surprise Ohh. What is this?
__label__fear No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under there!!
__label__non-neutral Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey! How long until Petes fight?
__label__neutral Oh, about five minutes. Right now theyre interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
__label__neutral Hot dog?
__label__fear Four, please.  Im really nervous.  Thank you.
__label__neutral So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
__label__neutral What?
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__joy I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really terrific.
__label__sadness Ohh, thats too bad!
__label__non-neutral No, I-Im saying I liked her.
__label__neutral Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
__label__non-neutral Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again.
__label__disgust Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
__label__neutral Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?
__label__neutral Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
__label__joy Hey, the fights starting!
__label__neutral Okay, well be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
__label__non-neutral Nine times!
__label__neutral Okay, I had to put on lotion!
__label__neutral But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
__label__neutral Fights over!
__label__neutral Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesnt want to get married?
__label__non-neutral Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.
__label__non-neutral Hi guys!
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral What are you up too?
__label__neutral Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites.
__label__neutral Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
__label__neutral Yeah, Big Brother.
__label__neutral Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
__label__neutral Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
__label__non-neutral Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
__label__neutral Eh
__label__sadness Okay well thats good to know.
__label__joy The Mr. Bowmonts here!!!
__label__joy Oh thats great, my friend Joeys in the movie business.
__label__neutral Yknow who I ran into from school? Howie.
__label__neutral My friends name is Joey.
__label__neutral Apparently Howies editing now.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
__label__surprise Can you believe that?!
__label__surprise Yknow I-I-I havent spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
__label__disgust Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie.
__label__disgust No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
__label__disgust The nerve huh?
__label__disgust Yeah!
__label__neutral Refill?
__label__non-neutral Hey! How you doing?
__label__joy Good! Good, long time no see.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Like your sweater.
__label__neutral Oh hey, right back at ya.
__label__surprise Oh, its crazy about Rachel huh?
__label__surprise Yeah. SheWell, shes one crazy lady?
__label__neutral So whose is it?
__label__neutral Umm, I dont some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral He is so weird.
__label__surprise You wanna fool around with Joey?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't    get it out of my head!
__label__surprise And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
__label__surprise Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
__label__neutral Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
__label__neutral Who, who are they?
__label__neutral I know them from work.
__label__surprise Both of them?
__label__neutral No, one of them...
__label__neutral Which one?
__label__neutral I don't know, what were the names I just said?
__label__non-neutral Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
__label__sadness All right, all right, you're right
__label__surprise What the hell are you cooking!
__label__surprise Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
__label__surprise Fire alarm?  Oh! Hi, officerfireman, can-can I help you?
__label__non-neutral We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
__label__non-neutral Thats not mine.
__label__non-neutral Yes it is.
__label__fear How do you know?
__label__disgust The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, dont wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
__label__anger Okay do youOkay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
__label__non-neutral Please reattach this, its against the law to disconnect them.
__label__non-neutral Fine!  But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
__label__neutral Theres a reset button under the plastic cover.
__label__surprise Theres a reset button?!
__label__joy Ugh, thank you!
__label__joy Thank you!
__label__surprise Theres a reset button!
__label__surprise My God!
__label__surprise Why didnt I see that!
__label__neutral Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button?
__label__joy Oh here it is!
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__joy Ohh, God!
__label__neutral Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
__label__anger Ring dammit, ring!
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__surprise Hey, you know our phone's not working?
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
__label__anger I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
__label__neutral Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.
__label__non-neutral Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
__label__anger Nngghhh!!!!!!!
__label__neutral Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
__label__neutral "Heating device."
__label__neutral Radiator.
__label__neutral Five letters.
__label__neutral Rdtor.
__label__surprise Yeah, is Sidney there?  Oh, this is?  Sidney's a woman.
__label__neutral Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
__label__neutral Well, how long do you think it'll be?
__label__neutral Any minute now.
__label__non-neutral Hey, this-  Heyy...
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey! Any good mail?
__label__neutral Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild.
__label__neutral Ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, Im kinda.
__label__neutral "Benefits lapsed."
__label__neutral Hmm thats weird. I dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
__label__neutral Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year.
__label__surprise Let me see that!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__surprise Oh, I cant believe this!
__label__anger This sucks!
__label__non-neutral When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow?
__label__non-neutral And it wouldnt matter.
__label__non-neutral Now I gotta be careful?
__label__non-neutral !
__label__non-neutral Im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire.
__label__non-neutral All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see my agent.
__label__neutral Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
__label__non-neutral look both ways before you cross the street.
__label__surprise I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
__label__joy I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
__label__neutral Y'know what else I can't believe?
__label__neutral I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
__label__neutral Do you know anything about women?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral That's all right.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__joy Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
__label__joy Yeah. He could row like a viking.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Mmm.
__label__neutral So how'd it go?
__label__neutral Oh, y'know..
__label__neutral Did he mention us?
__label__sadness He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
__label__sadness You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
__label__joy ...love you.
__label__neutral Are you're hands still wet?
__label__non-neutral Uh, moist, yeah.
__label__neutral Let's dry 'em again.
__label__non-neutral Oh my God! Oh my God!!
__label__surprise Still crying?
__label__neutral Like a
__label__neutral Yknow, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
__label__neutral Whats the other one?
__label__neutral I dont know, Ive never had to use the other one.
__label__neutral Im just saying yknow, if were having sex, hes not gonna be talking.
__label__non-neutral Oh thats right.
__label__neutral Youre the talker.
__label__joy Anyway uh, great idea!
__label__neutral Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
__label__neutral Oh, we have some
__label__non-neutral No you dont!
__label__neutral Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up.
__label__joy Great!
__label__neutral Yeah, what town are we near?
__label__neutral Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
__label__non-neutral Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route were on?
__label__neutral Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
__label__neutral Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?
__label__non-neutral I dont know, Im sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?
__label__neutral Okay!
__label__neutral Yeah, no they dont do that.
__label__non-neutral Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
__label__non-neutral Who?
__label__fear I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?
__label__neutral I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
__label__anger No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
__label__fear But if...
__label__anger No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, youll have to think of something else.
__label__joy Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
__label__non-neutral So the going for help went well?
__label__neutral Im telling you man, I saw it.
__label__anger Yeah, well, youre wrong! Okay, youre wrong.
__label__non-neutral Im not wrong! I wish I was. Im sorry. Bet that barium enema doesnt sound so bad now, huh?
__label__neutral I know.
__label__neutral Lets try a lookof far offwonderment.
__label__joy Okay, well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and the days to come.
__label__surprise Chandler!
__label__surprise What is the matter with your face?!
__label__non-neutral I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!"
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__anger Dont laugh at him!
__label__neutral Hes
__label__joy Aww!
__label__non-neutral Thats it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
__label__joy Were gonna find love!
__label__joy Definitely!
__label__neutral Yeah, Im pretty confident about that.
__label__joy Thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
__label__neutral It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
__label__neutral What do you mean?
__label__neutral Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.
__label__neutral You mean a backup?
__label__joy Exactly!
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah I got that.
__label__neutral You do?
__label__neutral Hm-mmm.
__label__neutral Who?
__label__neutral Joey.
__label__surprise Joey?!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__surprise Are you serious?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I locked him years ago!
__label__surprise Wh So If neither of you are married by the time youre 40, youre gonna marry Joey.
__label__neutral Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
__label__surprise Oh, seriously?
__label__neutral Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
__label__neutral Yeah, Im sorry man.  You wanna go watch?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Good morning.
__label__non-neutral Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
__label__joy Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
__label__non-neutral Ohh thats nice.
__label__joy Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
__label__disgust Wo-women? You mean like old women?
__label__neutral Well kinda old, like 30.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__surprise And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
__label__surprise Thats great! Wow man, so Joey mustve really taught you some stuff huh?
__label__neutral A little.
__label__surprise Yeah?
__label__neutral How you doin?
__label__joy Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
__label__neutral I know.
__label__non-neutral So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
__label__surprise What did you just say?
__label__joy You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
__label__surprise Are you serious?!
__label__joy Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
__label__joy I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
__label__joy Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!
__label__joy Whoa!
__label__non-neutral Where have I heard that before?
__label__neutral Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas.
__label__neutral I guess it must've been some movie I saw.
__label__neutral What do you say?
__label__joy Okay!
__label__joy Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
__label__non-neutral Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
__label__neutral It went under the table.
__label__non-neutral Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
__label__joy All right!
__label__joy Here it is! Here it is!
__label__neutral That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
__label__neutral It's a four.
__label__neutral I think so too.
__label__joy Well thats it. Im done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats.
__label__joy Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you.
__label__neutral Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
__label__neutral Is there anything we can do for you?
__label__neutral No just, nobody press on my stomach.
__label__neutral You can keep those pants by the way.
__label__surprise Whoaheywh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
__label__neutral Yeah, you want some?
__label__joy Ah, just cut me a little sliver.
__label__neutral A little bigger.
__label__neutral Little bigger.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral Are you afraid youre gonna run out?!
__label__anger Cut me a real piece!
__label__surprise Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
__label__neutral I need to talk to you, its pretty urgent. Its about Monica and Chandler.
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__neutral Of course, of course.
__label__neutral Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?
__label__neutral Umm, do you know each others hometowns?
__label__non-neutral Why dont you   Wh-whats going on?
__label__neutral Well, umm, not much.
__label__neutral But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow?
__label__neutral So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
__label__neutral Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler?
__label__neutral NothingWhy?!
__label__anger Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
__label__neutral Oh yeah it is! Im going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
__label__anger Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
__label__neutral Oh, Im sorry. Im so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
__label__non-neutral Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this.
__label__fear Okay,  I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life without you.
__label__sadness Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.
__label__sadness Your good heart Rach,  and, and....
__label__neutral No.
__label__sadness I cant, youre a totally different person to me now.
__label__sadness I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.
__label__non-neutral God, and now I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant,  it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.
__label__sadness Its just changed, everything.
__label__sadness Forever.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, but this cant be it, I mean.
__label__sadness Then how come it is?
__label__neutral Windows are clean, candels are lit.
__label__non-neutral Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt.
__label__neutral Did I turn the fish?
__label__neutral No, cause I made lasagne.
__label__non-neutral Am I out of control?
__label__neutral Just a touch.
__label__non-neutral Mon, I don't understand.
__label__surprise I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms?
__label__surprise I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.

__label__non-neutral Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know.
__label__non-neutral Things happen, and they happen.
__label__neutral You don't plan these things.
__label__neutral So, did you shave your legs?
__label__neutral Yeah.

__label__non-neutral Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato.
__label__neutral But that's okay, no problem.
__label__neutral No problem.
__label__non-neutral Hmm, noodle soup.
__label__neutral Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
__label__surprise Oh, what did I say?

__label__anger Theyre not!! Ross, theyre just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
__label__neutral Well then wed be in a lot of trouble, you dont know where any countries are.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?
__label__neutral This is a hospital.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__non-neutral Id have to say I really dont care for your tone.
__label__anger And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem toWhoa!
__label__surprise Oh gosh!
__label__surprise Whoa!
__label__surprise What-what?
__label__surprise Ow! Ow! Contraction.  Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
__label__neutral Would you like to see a semi-private room?
__label__neutral Yeah, it couldnt hurt to look.
__label__neutral I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
__label__non-neutral That's funny. Who are they?
__label__neutral The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
__label__surprise You mean they're lovers.
__label__neutral If you wanna put a label on it.
__label__surprise Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
__label__non-neutral Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
__label__neutral Okay, quick and painful.
__label__fear Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
__label__surprise Oh, what? What-what?

__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral How are ya?
__label__neutral Good.
__label__neutral Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guys cell phone?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__non-neutral And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
__label__fear Ooh, now you lost me.
__label__anger You stole the phone!
__label__non-neutral No I didnt!
__label__non-neutral No? So youre saying that if I called it, it wouldnt ring?
__label__fear No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work!
__label__anger Phoebe!
__label__non-neutral Its not here.
__label__neutral Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why dont you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
__label__neutral How could I have left them in the copy room?
__label__anger I dont know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? Its not a perfect world! Just go please.
__label__anger Fine.
__label__non-neutral Thank you.  Hello?  I still dont get it.
__label__joy How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
__label__neutral This will be your phone.
__label__neutral That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
__label__neutral No you answer it and take pledges.
__label__surprise But I'm the host!
__label__neutral No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
__label__neutral You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
__label__neutral Well, here's your phone doctor.
__label__neutral Hey guys.
__label__surprise Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean youre going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
__label__neutral Well, hes very charming.
__label__disgust I know, hes too charming, but if you two start going out, then its just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
__label__neutral Well, youre just gonna have to try.
__label__neutral Joey, where are the
__label__neutral I dont know, Chandler is supposed to be passin em around...
__label__neutral Phew, close one.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__surprise Look what happened!
__label__sadness Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up.
__label__non-neutral Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
__label__joy Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
__label__surprise Oh Im sorry! Do you need a break?
__label__non-neutral My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
__label__joy I can see it from right here. Itll cost you one husband.
__label__non-neutral Okay, Im sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
__label__non-neutral Come on more!
__label__non-neutral Oh God!
__label__neutral Yeah, you like that dont you?
__label__joy Oh yeah right there!

__label__non-neutral Uh Phoebe?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, say my name. Say it!  And now Im going to cover you back up, and umm were never doing this again.
__label__anger Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy?
__label__anger Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be!
__label__neutral Huh?
__label__anger Because I sure as hell cant figure it out!
__label__neutral I talk to you and its nothin.
__label__neutral You look at me, and nothin.
__label__neutral Nothing.
__label__joy You guys make me fly! High! Okay, were gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
__label__neutral Well, that was ah...
__label__surprise What?! What are you doing?!
__label__non-neutral Do you know what just happened?
__label__neutral Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
__label__neutral No. We were in the middle of sexand
__label__non-neutral Nooo! No, thats not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world!
__label__neutral Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
__label__neutral Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
__label__surprise Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
__label__non-neutral Oh, it's not!
__label__surprise Seriously, it's moving!
__label__surprise What the hell is in there?
__label__non-neutral It's just my knitting that's all!  Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
__label__neutral There will come a time in each of your careers when youll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.
__label__neutral I had such an opportunity in the recent, present.
__label__non-neutral And Im ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually.
__label__anger Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him.
__label__non-neutral And now, hes got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me Im stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV.
__label__sadness Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__surprise Rach?
__label__neutral Ill be out in a second.
__label__joy Oh.  Its just so unexpected! II uhBoy Ill tell you its just such an honor to be nominated for a

__label__neutral Okay honey, you can finish this later were gonna be late. We gotta go.
__label__non-neutral Please, dont play the music. Just uh one more.
__label__surprise I can't believe you don't want to know.
__label__non-neutral I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
__label__neutral And Monica knows...
__label__surprise Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
__label__neutral Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
__label__non-neutral So what's it gonna be?
__label__non-neutral Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
__label__joy I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
__label__neutral Or an uncle...
__label__joy Hey Phoebe!
__label__joy Hi Pheebs!
__label__joy Pheebs!
__label__anger Fine!
__label__neutral Phoebe, what's the matter?
__label__sadness Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
__label__non-neutral Oh, right, that's me!
__label__neutral Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
__label__neutral Fine.
__label__neutral Phoebe, what is it?
__label__neutral All right, you know Paolo?

__label__surprise Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
__label__joy More coffee over here, please!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__surprise Hey. What, what are you doing here?
__label__sadness Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental.
__label__neutral Yeah,  oh, but oh...
__label__neutral Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
__label__neutral Destiny.
__label__neutral Sure.
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__surprise Okay.  Yikes! That one doesnt look very fulfilled.
__label__neutral Oh, thats, thats ah, one of the old ones, hes just taking it to the back.
__label__non-neutral You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
__label__neutral Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
__label__non-neutral So, what happens to the old guys?
__label__neutral Well, they go into the chipper.
__label__fear Why, do I have a feeling thats not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!!
__label__surprise Hey! Hey!!
__label__neutral Light still out?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
__label__non-neutral Oh please, they're having sex.
__label__anger Shut up!
__label__neutral So, whaddya think George is like?
__label__neutral I think he's shy.
__label__surprise Yeah?
__label__neutral Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
__label__joy Hi! Hi, Im Ross, you dont know me, but Im a big, big fan of yours. I mean,
__label__neutral Arent you with that girl over there?
__label__neutral Well, yeah, kinda.
__label__neutral Um, but thats okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so Im allowed to sleep with you.
__label__non-neutral No, no, no, its flattery.
__label__non-neutral Im sorry.
__label__non-neutral Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella.
__label__fear Dont, dont just dismiss this so fast.
__label__neutral I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
__label__neutral Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
__label__neutral Um, yeah.
__label__neutral May I see it?
__label__fear Um, no.
__label__non-neutral Come on!
__label__neutral But, okay.
__label__surprise Im not on the list!
__label__neutral Um, see, but thats not the final draft.
__label__non-neutral Its laminated!
__label__neutral Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
__label__neutral Y'know its ironic...
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral ...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
__label__neutral Were just gonna be friends.
__label__non-neutral Get out of here you lurker!  Go on! Get!
__label__joy Hey Pheebs!
__label__surprise Ohh! You made up!
__label__neutral Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
__label__joy Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
__label__disgust Ohh, get a room.
__label__neutral We have one.
__label__disgust I know. Use it.
__label__surprise Oh Mon, listen I have to ask!
__label__neutral Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
__label__neutral Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
__label__non-neutral Ohh! And Im one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
__label__neutral Well, yknow its none of my business, but arent you married?
__label__non-neutral Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Yknow I just wish we could be like on a break!
__label__non-neutral Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
__label__neutral So thats the only reason she could be here huh?
__label__neutral It couldnt have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe Im a good listener and I uh I put on a
__label__non-neutral Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__neutral I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to you later.
__label__neutral Good-bye.
__label__surprise Whoa!
__label__neutral Uh, that was your sister actually.
__label__neutral She-she thinks that youre just using me.
__label__neutral So?
__label__sadness Im sorry.
__label__surprise What are you doing here?!
__label__neutral I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Umm, okay, okay, look.
__label__non-neutral I took this picture from your fridge.
__label__non-neutral Okay, because I know that this is my Father.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.
__label__anger Now, look I deserve to know where I came from.
__label__non-neutral All right?
__label__anger So if you can help me find my Father then you should!
__label__anger Otherwise, youre just mean!
__label__anger So, just tell me the truth!
__label__non-neutral All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
__label__surprise My Father is Chuck Magioni?
__label__neutral No, no, thats just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!
__label__sadness And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats the truth.
__label__sadness Oh.
__label__neutral But umm, youre right.
__label__neutral I think that a person should know where they come from.
__label__neutral Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay.
__label__neutral Im your mother.
__label__surprise Heh?
__label__sadness Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
__label__surprise Whats happening to your accent?
__label__surprise Come again?
__label__non-neutral Whats-whats this nonsense?
__label__sadness All right, Im-Im not English.
__label__neutral Im from Long Island.
__label__non-neutral I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.
__label__sadness Im sorry.
__label__non-neutral So, if we could just get back to the lecture.
__label__neutral Umm, were there any questions?
__label__neutral About paleontology.
__label__non-neutral All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.
__label__non-neutral Obviously, I screwed up.
__label__non-neutral But what you guys think of me is really important because Im-Im hoping to get a permanent job here.
__label__non-neutral So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
__label__non-neutral Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am
__label__non-neutral Well, hello Rachel!
__label__neutral Where you going, Joe?
__label__neutral For a walk.
__label__non-neutral Oh. You mind if I join you?
__label__neutral Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.
__label__surprise Your thoughts? Plural?
__label__joy Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!
__label__neutral I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
__label__non-neutral Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??
__label__non-neutral You guys are killing me!
__label__non-neutral She's forbidden fruit!
__label__non-neutral It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?
__label__neutral Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?
__label__neutral Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
__label__non-neutral Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
__label__surprise Great novels?
__label__neutral Fine ... mediocre porn
__label__neutral Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office.
__label__neutral Now, he doesnt get in until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
__label__non-neutral Thats kinda sad.
__label__neutral Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,
__label__joy Got it!
__label__joy Lets roll!
__label__neutral Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
__label__neutral Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anythingminute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan.
__label__neutral Uh actually, Id like to speak with both of you.
__label__neutral Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
__label__neutral Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
__label__neutral Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
__label__non-neutral Oh! No problem! I
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral You are iron.
__label__joy You are steel!
__label__non-neutral Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
__label__neutral I told you, were adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
__label__surprise I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
__label__neutral Look, you and I went to different high schools...
__label__neutral Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school.
__label__neutral You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.
__label__non-neutral I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
__label__surprise They had to have that specially made?!
__label__neutral It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
__label__surprise Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
__label__surprise Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out.
__label__joy And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.
__label__neutral I-I owe her this.
__label__neutral I never let her eat.
__label__neutral Oh, you go out with him.
__label__surprise Oh, really?!
__label__neutral Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
__label__neutral Ill try.
__label__neutral Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that youre dancing with.
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah, okay.
__label__non-neutral Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown  Im trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
__label__anger Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, shes real, uh, mellow!
__label__neutral Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know
__label__anger Ross, get over it! Its not like she hates you.
__label__sadness Yeah but
__label__neutral Ross, shes not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
__label__non-neutral Huh. Yknow whats not one of a kind? A twin!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__joy Ooh, Phoebes here! Okay, lets turn out all the lights and well just watch the movie!
__label__joy Okay. HeyOoh, cool sheets!
__label__joy Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
__label__joy Sure!
__label__non-neutral He got it a flea market!
__label__disgust You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
__label__neutral And Joey?
__label__neutral How do you think she's doing?
__label__surprise Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
__label__surprise Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
__label__joy Thank you!
__label__neutral Now that Rachel's gone?
__label__non-neutral So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
__label__non-neutral Oh, god help us.
__label__surprise What?
__label__disgust Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
__label__disgust Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
__label__non-neutral What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
__label__sadness I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
__label__joy So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
__label__joy Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
__label__neutral Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
__label__surprise What do you mean?
__label__sadness Carol our sex life isits just not working
__label__joy Hey there little fella!
__label__neutral Hey, uh-hey, why dont we get some shoes on ya, huh?
__label__joy Hey, why dont you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room!
__label__joy Yay!
__label__surprise !
__label__joy Yay!
__label__joy Yay!
__label__non-neutral Seriously, our sex life I was thinking, maybe I dont know, we could try some-some new things.
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__neutral For fun?
__label__surprise Like what?
__label__non-neutral Well I dont know umm,  what if we were too tie each other up?
__label__neutral Umm, some people eat stuff off one another.
__label__disgust Nah!
__label__neutral Umm, yknow we-we could try dirty talk?
__label__neutral Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
__label__joy I love that idea!
__label__joy Hey, Sophie!
__label__non-neutral So whos idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
__label__anger Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
__label__surprise Oh my God, they took my idea!
__label__surprise That was you?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah! Okay, here you go.
__label__neutral Rachel, I made you a cocoa.

__label__non-neutral Oh.
__label__neutral But
__label__surprise Oh! Oh, I love that but.

__label__sadness Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
__label__surprise Why would we do that?
__label__sadness Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
__label__neutral Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
__label__non-neutral Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
__label__surprise The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
__label__neutral The balloon?
__label__neutral No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached
__label__neutral I can't, I gotta go.

__label__non-neutral People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
__label__neutral She could be you.
__label__neutral Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
__label__anger Okay, I'm not getting this!
__label__joy I'm totally getting it!
__label__non-neutral Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
__label__surprise What? You just click when they click.
__label__neutral Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
__label__neutral Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
__label__disgust Great. It's gym class all over again.
__label__surprise I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
__label__neutral Nooo, it wasn't.
__label__joy Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
__label__joy Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
__label__neutral I know
__label__joy Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
__label__joy I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
__label__joy The sun is out!
__label__non-neutral Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
__label__neutral Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
__label__neutral Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
__label__sadness Nooo!
__label__anger Damn it!
__label__non-neutral Walls are pretty thin, guys!
__label__non-neutral Hi uh, Im Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect Id like to donate some fluids.
__label__neutral Were actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so were not looking for applicants right now.
__label__sadness Oh thats too bad. Ive kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure theres no studies I can participate in?
__label__neutral Well, heres a schedule of whats coming up.
__label__neutral Thanks.  Well but this one starts now.
__label__neutral Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. Its a twins study.
__label__surprise But its $2,000.
__label__sadness Sorry.
__label__neutral Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
__label__non-neutral We already got the results back on that on, and theyre not good.
__label__neutral Hey! Hows it goin?
__label__neutral Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
__label__joy Yes it has! I made cookies!
__label__neutral Oh thats all right. Im still full from your homemade potato chips.
__label__non-neutral But you should eat them now because theyre hot from the oven.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Oh-ho! But not in here! Cant eat em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
__label__neutral Okay, Ill be out in a second.
__label__neutral Okay!
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral That doesnt lock does it?
__label__disgust You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
__label__neutral That saves us a conversation.
__label__non-neutral Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
__label__neutral Me too, we should get goin'.
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Oh. Mine does.
__label__neutral Okay, here comes another camera.
__label__neutral Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
__label__neutral Why do they keep doing that?
__label__neutral If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms.
__label__neutral Theyve been taping those people up there all day.
__label__neutral Right.
__label__non-neutral Hey, whatd you guys do to get up on there?
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__surprise Hey! Youre a good dancer!
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Yeah, well youd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
__label__neutral What do you mean?
__label__neutral Like this.
__label__neutral Thats it, feel the rhythm. Thats better.
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__non-neutral Okay, youre dancing with that girl over there.
__label__non-neutral No-no-no-no-no we came together!
__label__neutral I dont see it.  You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
__label__non-neutral No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
__label__non-neutral Really, ythink so? I dont..
__label__non-neutral Why arent you home yet?!
__label__non-neutral Is someone there?
__label__neutral Oh yes, its me! Sorry!
__label__neutral What are you doing here?
__label__neutral Uh, Im just, Im just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
__label__neutral We got some
__label__neutral Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
__label__surprise Who?  Is that your sister?
__label__neutral Ugh, she
__label__disgust God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
__label__non-neutral Oh my God, look-look hes taking off her clothes!
__label__disgust Hes taking off her coat!
__label__disgust Oh, this is just terrible.
__label__non-neutral Ross! Wait!
__label__non-neutral Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about
__label__anger You suck!!
__label__anger What?!
__label__anger Okay, break-ups still on!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__sadness Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
__label__neutral No, I dont want to hit you.
__label__non-neutral Oh what then? Kick me?
__label__neutral No.
__label__surprise My son? Pretty serious.  Oh hey Katie!  What uh, what are you doing here?
__label__neutral Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this.
__label__neutral Ah, mustve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
__label__neutral Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__fear Oh uhI actually came here to ask you out.
__label__joy Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. Im just gonna put this  back in my pocket, pretend
__label__joy Sure!
__label__anger Horny bitch.  No! Youre a horny bitch! Noooo! Youre the horny bitch! No! Youre a horny bitch!
__label__non-neutral Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
__label__neutral Well, like father, like son.
__label__joy Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
__label__surprise Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
__label__non-neutral Well, y'know, possibly.  You didnt tell him that, though? Right?
__label__neutral Ummmmmmmm, no.
__label__non-neutral You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell the guy that!
__label__non-neutral Why not?! Id be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to getoh I see.
__label__non-neutral Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea.
__label__non-neutral Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
__label__neutral Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
__label__surprise Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
__label__surprise Instead of...?
__label__neutral That's right.
__label__neutral Never had that dream.
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
__label__surprise And they weren't looking at you before?!
__label__neutral Finally, I figure I'd better answer it,
__label__joy Honey! Dinners ready!
__label__joy Whats my little chef got for me tonight?
__label__joy Your favorite!
__label__joy Ho-ho-ho,  fried stuff with cheese!
__label__joy Yep! And lots of it!
__label__joy Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here.  Okay.
__label__joy Okay, in we go.
__label__joy Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!  How you doin?
__label__neutral Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate.
__label__non-neutral So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is.
__label__neutral Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
__label__surprise Oh my god.
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
__label__neutral Come on, they're close.
__label__disgust Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
__label__neutral Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
__label__disgust Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
__label__neutral Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
__label__disgust Oh my god, what were you thinking?
__label__neutral All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__surprise Ow!
__label__disgust I'm outta here.
__label__neutral Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
__label__joy Hello! One marriage please!
__label__joy Yep, we wanna get married!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__joy Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral Oh, that's
__label__neutral No, only because that's the graduation song.
__label__joy Okay!  This is it!  We're gonna get married!
__label__neutral Are you sure you wanna do this?
__label__joy Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
__label__joy Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
__label__neutral Wait!  Okay!
__label__neutral Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
__label__neutral It depends on who asked.
__label__neutral What if I asked?
__label__neutral Oh, Mon, sure.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__surprise Yes.  Youre not asking are you?
__label__neutral No.
__label__joy Yes! Totally!
__label__joy Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
__label__joy Youarenot going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
__label__surprise He asked you out?!
__label__non-neutral No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
__label__joy Saucy!
__label__neutral What are these?
__label__neutral Electrical plans for the building.
__label__fear Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
__label__neutral I know that switch does something, okay?
__label__neutral So-so I went down to city hall and got these.
__label__non-neutral All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
__label__surprise Wow! If only more people knew.
__label__neutral Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in
__label__neutral Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
__label__neutral So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
__label__neutral Oh, nobody's judging you.
__label__non-neutral Oh! Okay!  You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!
__label__surprise Oh man!
__label__joy I want that place so much!!
__label__non-neutral I was so sure that was gonna work!
__label__disgust There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
__label__neutral All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
__label__neutral Bye!
__label__neutral Bye!
__label__sadness Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.
__label__disgust Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
__label__surprise Actually, I did!
__label__neutral Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
__label__surprise Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
__label__surprise Are you serious?
__label__non-neutral Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
__label__non-neutral Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsShe knows!
__label__fear Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
__label__neutral All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
__label__neutral No, let's just leave the lights on.
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
__label__neutral Oh fine.
__label__joy Ready?  Wrestle!
__label__neutral Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
__label__neutral All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
__label__fear Can we please focus here, a naked mans life hangs in the balance!
__label__non-neutral Im telling you hes dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
__label__neutral All right, ladies and gentlemen, lets poke.
__label__neutral Steady.
__label__neutral Steady.
__label__neutral Okay, a little higher.
__label__neutral Careful of the angle.
__label__neutral Okay, okay, were approaching the window  Thread the needle.
__label__neutral Thread the needle.
__label__joy Hes alive! Hes a-live!!!
__label__disgust And yet, were still poking him.
__label__neutral Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
__label__non-neutral He does not look happy.
__label__surprise Hey-hey, now hes showing us his poking device.
__label__non-neutral Hey, thats never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
__label__non-neutral Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other.
__label__disgust Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard.
__label__surprise Oh God oh!
__label__surprise Contraction!
__label__neutral Yeah? Okay.
__label__surprise Ooh! Ow!!
__label__non-neutral Are you looking at her?!
__label__anger No!
__label__anger Dont you look at her you sick bastard!
__label__fear Honey I swear! I wasnt looking at her!
__label__anger Shes in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!
__label__neutral Umm. Umm, Im-Im just gonna
__label__anger See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!
__label__non-neutral No-no, ImIm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.
__label__neutral You miss your girlfriend?
__label__neutral Just ignore them.
__label__neutral Ross.
__label__non-neutral What? What?
__label__neutral Hes looking at me.
__label__anger Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
__label__anger Dont you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!
__label__neutral Pat Sajak?
__label__joy Yep!
__label__neutral Alex Trebek?
__label__joy Oh, of course!
__label__neutral Chuck Woolery?
__label__joy Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, whos ass I cannot kick.
__label__joy Say it!
__label__joy Say we are unagi!
__label__non-neutral Its not something you are! Its something you have!
__label__joy Say it!
__label__non-neutral Yknow what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
__label__neutral Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
__label__neutral Yeah, it's in there.
__label__surprise Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
__label__neutral Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
__label__surprise Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
__label__surprise Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
__label__neutral Yes. Yes.
__label__surprise You?!  And-and you?!
__label__joy Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
__label__surprise How?! When?!
__label__neutral It happened in London.
__label__surprise IN LONDON!!!
__label__neutral The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
__label__non-neutral But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
__label__fear No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
__label__fear Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
__label__non-neutral All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's
__label__joy I know, it's great!
__label__disgust Aww, I don't want to see that!
__label__non-neutral We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
__label__neutral And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
__label__neutral Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
__label__neutral No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
__label__neutral Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
__label__surprise Ahh!
__label__fear What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
__label__neutral Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
__label__surprise Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
__label__neutral You got a better idea?
__label__neutral All right, call it in the air.
__label__neutral Heads.
__label__neutral Heads it is.
__label__joy Yes! Whew!
__label__neutral We have to assign heads to something.
__label__neutral Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
__label__non-neutral What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
__label__neutral Okay, some tricks of the trade.
__label__neutral Now, Ive never been able to cry as an actor, so if Im in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling.
__label__neutral Or ah, or, lets say I wanna convey that Ive just done something evil.
__label__neutral That would be the basic I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it  Okay, lets say Ive just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.
__label__neutral And thats how its done.
__label__joy Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
__label__neutral Hey, Mr. Trib.
__label__non-neutral Hey-hey.
__label__neutral Then Im gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
__label__surprise Who are you?
__label__neutral Hi, Im Eric, Im gonna be Chandlers new roommate.
__label__surprise Im Chandlers new roommate.
__label__surprise I-I-I dont think so.
__label__surprise I could be Chandlers new roommate.
__label__surprise But, he told me over the phone.
__label__neutral He told me in person.
__label__surprise Thats weird.
__label__joy Well, Im going to go into my new apartment now.  Ehh!
__label__surprise Hey! Look who I found!
__label__joy Oh, hey guys!
__label__neutral Yknow, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
__label__neutral Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
__label__neutral Or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas?
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__neutral Didnt think so!
__label__neutral Okay, cmon guys, show us where the presents are!
__label__non-neutral Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thats as good as garbage?
__label__neutral Hmm, how about my azzz?
__label__neutral Hey, this is hollow.
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise This bench, its hollow! I cant believe I never knew that!  Oh, the presents!!!
__label__fear No, dont look directly at them!
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral Alright, no, we could look at them!
__label__neutral I
__label__non-neutral Hi! Im so glad youre here, but its gonna be a while. I-I wished youd called first.
__label__neutral Oh thats all right, Im coming back later with your father.
__label__non-neutral Oh good.
__label__neutral I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
__label__neutral Okay, whats up?
__label__neutral I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.
__label__surprise Ma, youre asking me to marry you?
__label__joy This is your grandmothers engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
__label__surprise Mom no, come on! Thank you.
__label__fear Just hear me out!
__label__sadness Maybe this wouldve happened if Id been more nurturing, or Id paid more attention, or I... had a uterus.
__label__non-neutral I cant believe this!
__label__sadness I know no, no, y'know you dont deserve this, you dont Ross.
__label__sadness Youre, youre really, youre so good.
__label__sadness Thanks.
__label__neutral And youre so sweet.  And youre kind
__label__non-neutral Thanks.
__label__surprise Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
__label__surprise Huh?
__label__neutral Okay, its okay.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__non-neutral Wait, wait, wait.
__label__neutral What?
__label__non-neutral My foot is stuck in the pocket.
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral No, I cant get it out.
__label__neutral Rachel?
__label__surprise Yeah.  Hi Mark!
__label__joy Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
__label__surprise Oh, I did!
__label__joy Yes.
__label__surprise Oh my God!!
__label__joy Congratu!!  -lations-lations.
__label__anger I cant believe I did this! What an idiot!
__label__non-neutral Oh, stop beating yourself up!
__label__neutral People make mistakes!
__label__neutral These things happen!
__label__neutral There arent any message youve forgotten to give me are there?
__label__anger Apparently youre not very good at it!
__label__neutral I
__label__neutral Philadelphia.
__label__surprise Oh my God! So was she! Oh, Ive got-Ive got goose bumps.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Well, yknow Im wearing layers and its warm.
__label__neutral Yeah-yeah.
__label__non-neutral But ifno look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
__label__neutral Did you hear that?!
__label__non-neutral I dont need you guys to care about me!
__label__joy Because the universe cares!
__label__joy The whole universe!
__label__sadness I really wished theyd care just a little bit though.
__label__neutral Yknow, I dont-I dont think its you.
__label__fear This is a freaky place.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral Guys!
__label__neutral Oh no, its you.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy I like this one.  It seems to say, "I love you and thats why I have to kill you."
__label__joy They cant all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
__label__surprise Do you really want to pull at that thread?
__label__joy Im having a really good time!
__label__non-neutral Me too! Im sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.
__label__neutral Ohh. No thats okay, hes a friend.
__label__fear Hey uh, I dont mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
__label__sadness Yeah, I Well yknow I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so Id just be lost.
__label__surprise I know its really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss andOh no! No! No! My God!
__label__neutral Okay, dont freak out. Ill go.
__label__non-neutral No its Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!
__label__neutral Okay, I know. Hold on.  Hey Ross?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Yeah, umm thats Whitney , Kyles ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can yknow divert her so that we can slip out?
__label__surprise What?! No!
__label__neutral Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
__label__neutral Look, I dont think so Pheebs.  All right, Ill do it. But just because youre a friend.
__label__neutral Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
__label__neutral I'll take sports.
__label__non-neutral Mine!
__label__neutral All right. Uhh, international.
__label__neutral Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say
__label__disgust You two will have very hairy children.
__label__non-neutral Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
__label__non-neutral Ross! Janice?!
__label__neutral All right, hold on!
__label__neutral Hold on.
__label__neutral Hold on.
__label__neutral This is Ross, okay?
__label__neutral He's our friend.
__label__non-neutral He obviously went crazy.
__label__non-neutral He obviously lost his mind.
__label__non-neutral Look, I
__label__neutral So are you actually gonna see her again?
__label__anger Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
__label__neutral I
__label__anger Damnit Phoebe!!
__label__neutral Hey, dont we have to...
__label__neutral Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
__label__non-neutral Umm, I think youre really, really great...
__label__non-neutral Oh God!
__label__non-neutral Here we go again.
__label__anger Why does this keep happening to me?
__label__non-neutral Is it something Im putting out there?
__label__non-neutral Is this my fault?
__label__non-neutral Or am I just nuts?
__label__surprise I-I-I-I-I dont know, I dont know what to say.
__label__non-neutral Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
__label__non-neutral Wait!
__label__non-neutral Terry!
__label__non-neutral Please!
__label__sadness Look, I just lost my other job.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__sadness You have no idea how much I need this.
__label__sadness Please, help me out, for old times sake.
__label__sadness This poor guys been in a coma for five years. Its hopeless.
__label__joy Its not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Ramorays a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
__label__neutral Good morning.  Drake, its your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
__label__joy Im back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
__label__anger That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
__label__neutral Well you did pull his hair.
__label__anger He took my snack!
__label__anger Im not getting into this again!
__label__non-neutral Okay! Oh God, yknow what? Its really bad.
__label__anger Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.
__label__non-neutral This doesnt mean anything, does it?
__label__anger Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! Right?
__label__neutral That is true.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
__label__neutral Oh, Ive been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
__label__neutral Joey, you know you dont actually have one.
__label__non-neutral Come on! What are you doing?! Im in character! Would you talk to her!
__label__non-neutral Ahh, I think it just moved. Its really poking me.
__label__non-neutral All right, thats it, were going to the emergency room.
__label__non-neutral What?! No, you cant, you cant leave me here with them! Were baby-sitting!
__label__non-neutral The babies are asleep, Im sure youll be okay on your own for a while!
__label__non-neutral But you-you cant leave me with them! We-were a team! Were playing a zone! Theyre gonna triple team me!
__label__non-neutral Hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got to go to the hospital.
__label__neutral But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
__label__neutral I think thats gum.
__label__neutral Im pretty sure its gun.
__label__non-neutral Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go.
__label__non-neutral A real man wouldnt just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?
__label__neutral That was the only way I could get him to
__label__neutral Hi! How are the Gellers?
__label__anger Dont call us that!
__label__anger The judge wouldnt let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
__label__non-neutral Hey! Its Porsche!!
__label__joy Hey sweetie!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__surprise Theres no back to this couch!
__label__surprise Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
__label__neutral Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yknow?
__label__neutral Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think I was yknow, all dead inside.
__label__joy Oh thats so sweet! Look Chandler I dont care if you cant cry, I love you.
__label__neutral Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
__label__non-neutral Stop it!
__label__neutral No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, were up at the altar and Im like this.
__label__neutral I wont care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__non-neutral Of course he is!
__label__non-neutral What, do you think Id just use my son as-as an excuse?
__label__anger What kind of father do you think I am?
__label__neutral All right, sorry.
__label__neutral I gotta go make a fake Ben.
__label__surprise The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
__label__neutral Well, either that or uh
__label__non-neutral Joey!!
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__non-neutral Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
__label__non-neutral Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
__label__joy Yeah, and theyve been coming by all day. They love it!
__label__joy They love my candy? Oh man!!! Ive gotta go make more!!
__label__neutral Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something mightve happened to a huge chunk of it.
__label__joy Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
__label__non-neutral Mine stole my newspaper! Its like a
__label__neutral Sure!
__label__neutral Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldnt stop thinking about it.
__label__neutral I mean, everyone should have a-a
__label__surprise Oh my God Ross!!
__label__joy You like it?
__label__neutral I
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Hello darlings.
__label__joy And theres daddy!
__label__surprise There he is! There he is!
__label__neutral Where?
__label__joy Right- where we've been looking all night!
__label__joy He is so cute!
__label__joy Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
__label__joy Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop thewowww.
__label__joy I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
__label__joy Yeah, isn't he?
__label__joy It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
__label__joy You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
__label__surprise Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
__label__neutral Huh. That's nice.
__label__neutral and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve just lasted just one day, burned for
__label__neutral Eight whole days.
__label__joy Thats right, and thats why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
__label__joy Awesome!
__label__surprise Yeah?
__label__neutral My favorite part was when
__label__neutral The Armadillo was actually not so
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__surprise Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunnys funeral in here.
__label__joy Come on, come on, were-were-were lighting the candles!
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral Okay, I understand why
__label__neutral Hes says, Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, sure. Good luck!
__label__joy Im quitting!! Woo-hoo!  Im okay!! Im all right!!
__label__surprise Wow! Thats exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
__label__neutral What?
__label__surprise Im just saying, this woman, I mean shes fictitious. No?
__label__non-neutral Why would you say that?
__label__neutral Cause youre still into Monica.
__label__neutral So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
__label__non-neutral Youre good. Youre good!
__label__neutral Yeah, no, Im fairly intuitive and psychic. Its a substantial gift.
__label__fear Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though?
__label__neutral Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
__label__non-neutral Thanks a lot.
__label__neutral No Im serious. I mean Im intuitive, but my memory sucks.
__label__neutral Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
__label__anger For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
__label__neutral Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
__label__joy Oh, thanks, sweetie.
__label__joy No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__fear You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
__label__neutral No, no, they will. I just... uh...
__label__neutral Can't wait.
__label__surprise Do I know you?
__label__surprise Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
__label__neutral Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
__label__surprise You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
__label__non-neutral Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
__label__surprise Uh, wait, backstage?
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
__label__neutral Ross.
__label__neutral Chandler.
__label__neutral How are you?
__label__neutral Look, you guys wanna meet the group?
__label__neutral Come on.
__label__surprise So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
__label__disgust Do you have any respect for your body?
__label__disgust Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
__label__anger Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.
__label__neutral The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
__label__neutral Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__surprise He does?
__label__joy Hey, buddy, what's up!
__label__surprise Oh, she told you about that, huh.
__label__neutral Well, yeah, I have one now and then.
__label__neutral Well, yeah, now.
__label__neutral Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before.
__label__joy Well, okay, thanks!
__label__joy God, he's good.
__label__neutral If only he were a woman.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Hey, Frank.
__label__neutral Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didnt.
__label__neutral Theres someone here who can explain this better than I can.
__label__neutral Hi Frank.
__label__neutral Hi, Mrs. Knight.
__label__neutral Phoebes right Frank.
__label__neutral I know its hard to hear, but it wouldve been wrong to go through with it.
__label__sadness I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not.
__label__non-neutral Is that it, is that what it is?
__label__neutral Yeah, but not just that.
__label__sadness Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less
__label__neutral None the less.
__label__sadness None the less. Umm, youre too young to, to really know what you want.
__label__neutral Thats right, exactly.
__label__non-neutral All right, its a good bye kiss, thats good.
__label__neutral Bye-bye.
__label__non-neutral Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what Im saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong.
__label__non-neutral Okay, Ive decided Im gonna let this happen!
__label__neutral Okay, can I just get my purse?
__label__neutral Okay, all right, good.
__label__neutral .
__label__surprise Oh, look look look.
__label__neutral The last candle's about to burn out.
__label__neutral 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__fear Kinda... spooky without any lights.
__label__joy Bwah-hah-hah!
__label__non-neutral OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
__label__neutral Oh.. oh... oh.
__label__neutral Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
__label__neutral All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
__label__joy You blew them away!
__label__joy Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!
__label__neutral I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?
__label__surprise I was
__label__joy No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
__label__surprise Oh my God!  I'm your
__label__non-neutral I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
__label__non-neutral Look, I took it too far!
__label__neutral Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
__label__neutral Could've played
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__neutral Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
__label__neutral Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the
__label__neutral Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
__label__neutral Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.
__label__surprise Nooo!
__label__neutral Hello?
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.
__label__non-neutral Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
__label__neutral Green. To the green.
__label__neutral I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind.
__label__neutral To the left, to the left- aww!
__label__neutral Ohhh... I'm fine.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__non-neutral Please tell me you got the message!
__label__neutral What message?
__label__neutral The actor playing Mac couldnt do it, they needed to see you at 2 oclock.
__label__surprise What?! Its 6 oclock!
__label__fear Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!
__label__non-neutral I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya!
__label__neutral I went to Rosss!
__label__neutral I went to the coffeehouse!
__label__neutral I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
__label__neutral Thats the day youre gonna die? Seedarnit, Ive got shuffleboard that day.
__label__neutral Thats what you think.
__label__neutral Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers? Wouldnt they have the recipe?
__label__neutral Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
__label__neutral What was her name?
__label__neutral Nesele Toulouse.
__label__neutral Nestle Tollhouse
__label__neutral Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
__label__neutral (grabbing a bag of
__label__non-neutral Yes!!  Oh.
__label__non-neutral I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
__label__non-neutral I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!!
__label__neutral So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
__label__joy Absolutely!
__label__joy I am so on board!
__label__non-neutral Rachel didn't you just light that?
__label__neutral Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.
__label__neutral I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
__label__disgust Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
__label__neutral Tell me about it!
__label__joy Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
__label__neutral It does sound appealing.
__label__non-neutral Oh, I never could do it.
__label__neutral Oh but you could.
__label__neutral You can.
__label__joy Absolutely!
__label__joy We can help each other out!
__label__neutral We can get--what are those--those patches!
__label__joy We could be like the Patch Sisters!
__label__joy Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
__label__joy Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
__label__sadness My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.
__label__non-neutral Okay then!
__label__non-neutral I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
__label__neutral Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
__label__neutral Does, um, anyone wanna see?
__label__non-neutral Nooo!
__label__anger Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
__label__disgust It's worse than the thumb!
__label__anger Hey, this is so unfair!
__label__surprise Oh, why is it unfair?
__label__non-neutral So I have a flaw!
__label__anger Big deal!
__label__non-neutral Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?
__label__non-neutral And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?
__label__non-neutral And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?
__label__disgust I mean, what the hell is that thing?
__label__non-neutral ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
__label__non-neutral ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
__label__neutral Well, I-I could live without it.
__label__non-neutral Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
__label__neutral Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
__label__anger Oh,  "you do, do you"?
__label__neutral You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
__label__non-neutral "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
__label__neutral Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
__label__anger Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
__label__sadness Awww! Mel Torme died.
__label__neutral Joey, that papers like a year old!
__label__sadness Aw! Does that mean the
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
__label__neutral Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
__label__neutral Probably?
__label__disgust Yeah, I don't like that word.
__label__neutral Kind of what probably really means.
__label__neutral Yeah, uh-huh.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow?
__label__non-neutral I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!"
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__neutral You gotta take care of yourselves!
__label__neutral In
__label__neutral Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
__label__joy Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
__label__joy Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesnt he?
__label__neutral Hes a keeper. How are you feeling?
__label__neutral Oh, Im fine.
__label__neutral Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her all alone.
__label__neutral Oh, Im not doing it alone. I have Ross.
__label__neutral Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
__label__neutral Well then he gets a divorce, its Ross!
__label__neutral Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family.
__label__non-neutral Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.
__label__disgust Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
__label__neutral Hey. Whos that?
__label__neutral New people.
__label__neutral What happened to the Disgustingtons?
__label__non-neutral Theyre having their baby!
__label__anger Its not fair Ross we got here first!
__label__neutral Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.
__label__neutral Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
__label__surprise Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
__label__neutral Phoebe?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__surprise Look at that guy by the window, wow!
__label__neutral Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.
__label__sadness Oh, what is wrong with me lately?
__label__neutral I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here.
__label__non-neutral Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
__label__neutral Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
__label__surprise Really?! So this has happened to you?
__label__neutral Oh absolutely yeah!
__label__neutral Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
__label__non-neutral Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap.
__label__neutral Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a
__label__disgust Ugh!
__label__fear I dont know what Im going to do!
__label__anger I called the company that sent and th-they dont care!
__label__non-neutral Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is?
__label__joy Hey guys!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hey
__label__joy I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!
__label__joy And the guys from work had a blast.
__label__non-neutral Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
__label__non-neutral Yeah!
__label__surprise And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
__label__non-neutral So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, right!
__label__neutral I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those
__label__surprise That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
__label__surprise So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
__label__joy Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
__label__non-neutral So you might say, its a magic ring.
__label__surprise OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!
__label__neutral Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
__label__neutral Obviously! So, how do we decide?
__label__neutral Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should date her
__label__neutral Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
__label__non-neutral Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her
__label__neutral Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
__label__neutral Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
__label__neutral Yeah well we should order some food then.
__label__non-neutral No Joey! Look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, well
__label__neutral That sounds fair.
__label__neutral Maybe Ill take her to that new French restaurant down the street
__label__non-neutral Ah yeahwait a second now!
__label__neutral Look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.
__label__non-neutral I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
__label__neutral Well sorry, thats what I do on dates.
__label__neutral All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates.
__label__neutral So lets decide on the spending limit
__label__neutral Yeah. Uh, a slicesix dollars?
__label__neutral I was thinking more like a hundred.
__label__neutral Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
__label__neutral Hi, again.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__joy Thank you soo, much.
__label__anger Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
__label__neutral You want some help with that?
__label__neutral Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I dont!
__label__surprise Whoa! Are you okay?
__label__surprise Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
__label__neutral Its the heat.  And-and the humidity.
__label__neutral Thats a uh, thats a tough combination.
__label__neutral Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
__label__surprise Like you wouldnt believe.  Wow! This is a great place.
__label__neutral What do you mean?
__label__neutral Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__neutral Hey, somebody left their keys.
__label__surprise Ooohh, to a Porsche!
__label__surprise Transcribers note: Oh come on!
__label__surprise Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind?
__label__neutral If I had a Porsche, Id have the keys surgically attached to my hand!
__label__neutral Hey Gunther, these yours?
__label__disgust Yeah, thats what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
__label__neutral Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?
__label__neutral Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found?
__label__surprise Theres a lost and found?  My shoe!
__label__surprise You left a shoe here?!
__label__neutral Well, I didnt realize until I got home.
__label__neutral I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__neutral Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.
__label__neutral Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe.
__label__joy Great! Thanks.
__label__neutral Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
__label__non-neutral Carol, we've been through this before, ok?
__label__joy We have a good time.
__label__joy We laugh, we play.
__label__joy It's like we're father and son.
__label__joy Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
__label__joy Oh, this is so cute.
__label__neutral Oh, I got that for him.
__label__joy My mommies love me. That's clever.
__label__neutral Hello?
__label__neutral Oh, Hi, JuHi, Jew!
__label__neutral Uh huh?
__label__neutral Uh huh?
__label__neutral Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great.
__label__neutral See ya then.
__label__neutral Bye.
__label__surprise Did you just say Hi, Jew?
__label__neutral Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
__label__non-neutral Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes!
__label__joy Thanks Monica!
__label__disgust Does that smell bother you?
__label__surprise What the smell from Joeys? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
__label__neutral Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie to cover it.
__label__non-neutral I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
__label__joy Okay!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  Its for you. Its the fire inspector.
__label__surprise Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair straightener that started the fire.
__label__neutral No-no, it was the candles.
__label__non-neutral Its very not good leaving candles unattended.
__label__neutral In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay.
__label__neutral Well, I have to go now.
__label__surprise Joey proposed to me.
__label__surprise Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!
__label__fear Well, I-I said yes.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral Are you crazy?
__label__non-neutral You just had Ross's baby!
__label__non-neutral It's-it's so  inappropriate.
__label__disgust No, it's worse than that.
__label__disgust It's wrong.
__label__surprise It's… It is bigger than  mine!
__label__neutral I know.
__label__non-neutral You can't marry him!
__label__non-neutral Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.
__label__neutral Well do you love him?
__label__neutral Sure.
__label__non-neutral Sure?
__label__neutral Yeah, I mean whatever.
__label__non-neutral Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?
__label__non-neutral No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
__label__neutral So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
__label__non-neutral Here comes the bride.
__label__surprise Oh my God Monica!
__label__joy I wanna wear this everyday.
__label__joy You look so beautiful.
__label__joy Im so happy for me.
__label__neutral Hello?
__label__non-neutral Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
__label__neutral Yeah, we got him back. Everythings fine.
__label__anger Damnit!
__label__neutral Uh, yknow what?
__label__anger Ill tell you who it hurts!
__label__anger It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principals office wearing nothing but a catchers mitt!
__label__neutral That was
__label__anger I will be! Listen, I dont want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
__label__neutral Fine.
__label__non-neutral Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.
__label__non-neutral And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want!
__label__neutral No thats not what I want. Uh, Im glad you guys were bonding but I
__label__non-neutral Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff!
__label__non-neutral And I havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway!
__label__anger Crap!!
__label__neutral I gotta go!
__label__surprise Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
__label__neutral No.
__label__surprise Me neither! We have to get in!
__label__neutral Just act like you belong.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Oranges!
__label__neutral Shh!  Nice to see you again.
__label__neutral Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
__label__neutral Yes, of course.
__label__neutral Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see the seat number.
__label__neutral Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A.
__label__non-neutral Okay.  Mrs. Green! Okay Im really sorry!! Im apologizing for the  Okay, I bit my tongue, but Im
__label__joy Hey! Look whos back! Its the birthday girl! Hows the birthday girl feeling?
__label__non-neutral Well, I feel fine, but I think youre bumming out the rest of the kids.
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral Okay!
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__non-neutral I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.
__label__neutral All I really needed was a plan.
__label__neutral See I wanna have three kids
__label__non-neutral Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
__label__neutral As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time Im 35 which gives me five years.
__label__joy I love this plan!
__label__joy I wanna marry this plan!
__label__non-neutral You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed!
__label__non-neutral Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,
__label__non-neutral Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too yknow!
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
__label__neutral I dont know.
__label__disgust Why am I not surprised?
__label__anger Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this!
__label__neutral I dont think you have much choice.
__label__anger Well well see!
__label__neutral Bye-bye!
__label__neutral Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?
__label__neutral Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .
__label__neutral Dad?
__label__neutral Im here!
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
__label__sadness Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.
__label__neutral Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
__label__neutral Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
__label__sadness Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.
__label__joy Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of the memories
__label__neutral Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven
__label__neutral I used to
__label__neutral Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
__label__neutral Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a
__label__neutral Ok, got the vent open.
__label__joy Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
__label__neutral Ben, you ready?
__label__neutral All right, gimme your foot.
__label__neutral Ok, on three, Ben.
__label__neutral One, two, three.
__label__neutral Ok, That's it, Ben.
__label__neutral What do you see?
__label__neutral Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
__label__surprise Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
__label__surprise Wait! You forgot your legs!
__label__joy You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
__label__joy Thank you.
__label__neutral Filing system?
__label__surprise Oh-oh!
__label__neutral You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?
__label__joy It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
__label__neutral Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
__label__neutral I notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
__label__joy Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
__label__joy Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost
__label__neutral I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
__label__non-neutral Oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!
__label__neutral Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
__label__neutral Yes, I realize that
__label__neutral And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
__label__joy I love working with designers!
__label__neutral With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?
__label__neutral Chandler, you have an assistant right?
__label__fear Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
__label__neutral Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
__label__surprise I do?
__label__neutral Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Or not.
__label__neutral Where's Chandler?
__label__neutral Here I am.
__label__disgust Wash your hands!!!
__label__surprise How did youknow?
__label__surprise Hey! What's she doing back here?
__label__neutral Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
__label__neutral Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
__label__surprise What happened in Atlantic City?!
__label__neutral Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
__label__non-neutral Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
__label__neutral And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?
__label__neutral So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.
__label__non-neutral Now, I know what youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls.
__label__surprise You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
__label__non-neutral In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
__label__joy Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
__label__non-neutral Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
__label__neutral Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
__label__neutral So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
__label__non-neutral Of course I am!
__label__neutral Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot.
__label__neutral Ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.
__label__neutral And-and then guess what?
__label__non-neutral The babys coming and I dont know what to do.
__label__non-neutral Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
__label__neutral No. Sweetie, youre gonna be fine.
__label__non-neutral Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
__label__neutral Im going to the bathroom.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay.
__label__neutral It
__label__joy Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
__label__neutral I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
__label__neutral Not if you were here.
__label__neutral Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
__label__joy Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope its you!
__label__neutral I hope its you.
__label__joy Me too!
__label__non-neutral First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so important to me
__label__non-neutral Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
__label__neutral Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.
__label__neutral Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine
__label__joy Yes!!! Oh!!
__label__non-neutral Hypothetically!
__label__neutral Still.
__label__neutral If Phoebe were my maid of honor
__label__neutral Uh-hmm.
__label__neutral Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
__label__neutral Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.
__label__neutral Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours?
__label__neutral Well thats the best part. Umm,
__label__surprise Wh-why is that the best part?
__label__joy Because then I dont have to!
__label__neutral Well of
__label__non-neutral Im really not deciding!
__label__non-neutral Fine!
__label__neutral Yeah thats right.
__label__joy Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!
__label__neutral If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?
__label__neutral It's not just the drum noise.
__label__non-neutral Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye!
__label__non-neutral Oh god, my eye!"
__label__non-neutral I mean, it is so annoying.
__label__neutral Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
__label__surprise Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
__label__neutral Maybe on some level.
__label__surprise Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
__label__neutral No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you.
__label__joy Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you.
__label__joy And, a brownie!
__label__neutral Well, half a brownie.
__label__neutral Actually, its just bag.
__label__neutral Its been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin to feel faint so
__label__joy Oh man!
__label__joy This is so great!
__label__joy I actually feel like Im going on a real date!
__label__neutral Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and Im wearing underwear that goes up to aboutthere.
__label__non-neutral Hey come on now, this is a real date.
__label__neutral Uh, sonice place you got here.
__label__surprise Foosball, huh?
__label__neutral Pizza box.
__label__surprise Oh, a subscription to
__label__neutral Yeah, actually thats my roommates.
__label__neutral I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
__label__neutral Ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch yourself.
__label__non-neutral Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking?
__label__neutral Hm-mmm.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
__label__neutral Yeah, but Im pretty sure hes gay.
__label__non-neutral No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
__label__anger Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
__label__neutral Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
__label__joy Ha. Ha, ha.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
__label__disgust Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
__label__neutral Oh, I beg to differ. The
__label__neutral That was
__label__joy Oooooh.  : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
__label__surprise Well, not playing raquetball!
__label__surprise He forgot to leave his grip size!
__label__surprise He didn't get the goggles!
__label__neutral Well,sounds like you two have issues.
__label__neutral Goodbye, baby.
__label__neutral Ciao, bela.
__label__neutral Do they wait for me to do this?
__label__neutral So are you gonna tell him?
__label__neutral Why would I tell him?
__label__neutral How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
__label__non-neutral Oh...
__label__non-neutral What are you guys doing here?
__label__surprise Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
__label__neutral ...What did I ask?
__label__disgust God. I feel violated.
__label__disgust Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
__label__neutral Ross, ten o'clock.
__label__non-neutral Is it? Feels like two.
__label__neutral No,
__label__neutral What?
__label__joy There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
__label__joy Oh. Hel-lo!
__label__joy She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
__label__joy Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
__label__fear Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
__label__joy Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
__label__neutral Oh please, could she
__label__neutral He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
__label__joy Thank you, buddy.
__label__neutral Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
__label__joy You could do that!
__label__surprise Y'think?
__label__neutral OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
__label__neutral OK.
__label__joy This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
__label__neutral Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
__label__neutral Last time I do that, I promise.
__label__sadness I am so, so, so, so sorry!
__label__disgust Uh-huh.
__label__non-neutral And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
__label__non-neutral Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin me?!
__label__non-neutral Come on Monica, its our Valentines Day. Please? Please-please, please?
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral So, are we going in there?
__label__joy I am!!
__label__surprise Wow!
__label__neutral It actually is in the handbook.
__label__non-neutral I cant date you or have a hot plate in my office.
__label__non-neutral I cant believe we have to stop seeing each other.
__label__non-neutral For what its worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
__label__neutral I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we cant date. Its against the rules. Its forbidden.
__label__surprise Wow!
__label__surprise What?
__label__joy Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, its really hot.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral Well I-I-I dont care how hot it is its-its uh, its wrong.
__label__non-neutral Stop it!
__label__non-neutral No! No! Its wrong! Its-its-its naughty. Its taboo.
__label__non-neutral Shut the book!
__label__joy Lets also get a hot plate!
__label__joy Rach, youre in a great place in your life. Come on, youve got a great job! Good friends
__label__non-neutral Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
__label__neutral Oh Im not, I just like to try these on.
__label__neutral I do the same thing.
__label__joy Im just kidding. Im getting married July 25
__label__joy Im just kidding too.  Im getting married in December.
__label__neutral So when are you getting married?
__label__neutral Oh May 15
__label__joy Oooh its getting close!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral So uh, whos your photographer?
__label__neutral Jeffery.
__label__non-neutral We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
__label__surprise The best man? Wow!
__label__joy I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, whos your band?!
__label__neutral Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
__label__non-neutral Oh, youre so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
__label__joy Ooh, is that spelled with a C or a K? Oh my God! It doesnt matter; theyre both great!
__label__neutral Oh yknow what?
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__neutral Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinmans and get it half off.
__label__disgust This place is so overpriced.
__label__neutral So, does this  come in another color or
__label__neutral I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time.
__label__surprise It was unbelievable!
__label__joy We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
__label__neutral So have you called her yet?
__label__fear Let her know I like her?
__label__non-neutral What are you, insane?
__label__non-neutral It's the next day!
__label__non-neutral How needy do I want to seem?
__label__non-neutral I'm right, right?
__label__neutral Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
__label__surprise I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
__label__non-neutral Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
__label__neutral Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.
__label__neutral Her answer machine?
__label__neutral No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
__label__neutral So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
__label__disgust Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
__label__surprise Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
__label__neutral Okay, okay, what's going on?
__label__neutral Okay, they're just talking...
__label__neutral Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
__label__neutral So, um, what do you do for a living?
__label__neutral Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
__label__neutral Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
__label__sadness I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
__label__neutral Now that is funny.
__label__neutral Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?
__label__sadness 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
__label__neutral I guess.
__label__neutral Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
__label__neutral Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
__label__neutral Come on.
__label__neutral These people'll scooch down.
__label__neutral You guys'll scooch, won't you?
__label__joy Let's try scooching!
__label__neutral Come on.
__label__neutral Come on.
__label__neutral Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.
__label__neutral Carol, Kristin.
__label__neutral Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.
__label__non-neutral And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral When I was six years old.
__label__neutral Hm-mmm.
__label__neutral I wanted a big wheel.
__label__non-neutral And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.
__label__sadness It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me.
__label__sadness That was a pretty tough year.
__label__joy Thats-thats great!
__label__neutral See?
__label__joy I already feel like I know you a little better!
__label__joy Thank you.
__label__neutral Okay, come on.
__label__neutral Now we can go eat.
__label__neutral Lets go.
__label__sadness It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__anger Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
__label__surprise That's patio furniture!
__label__neutral So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
__label__neutral What about the birds?
__label__neutral I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
__label__neutral You pick one.
__label__neutral All right, how about the ladybugs?
__label__non-neutral Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
__label__non-neutral Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
__label__non-neutral Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!
__label__neutral Bijan for men?
__label__neutral Bijan for men?
__label__neutral Bijan for...   Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
__label__neutral Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
__label__neutral Ready, Annabelle?
__label__neutral You bet.  Maybe some other time?
__label__sadness Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?!
__label__joy That was amazing!
__label__neutral Phoebe and Gary are
__label__joy That was amazing.
__label__joy We are the hottest! Huh?
__label__neutral No, you're the best.
__label__neutral No, you're the best.
__label__neutral No, you're the best.
__label__neutral I
__label__neutral Hey guys!  What 'cha been doin'?
__label__neutral Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
__label__neutral How you doin'?
__label__neutral So what are you gonna do?
__label__sadness What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
__label__non-neutral Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
__label__non-neutral Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while?
__label__non-neutral Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
__label__neutral Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
__label__neutral Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
__label__neutral Why? What happened to him?
__label__neutral Nothing, hes just really believes in that.
__label__neutral It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
__label__joy Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
__label__neutral Well, okay, so whats nowgo get, go get the eggs, put em in there.
__label__neutral Okay, itll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
__label__surprise Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
__label__neutral Um-hmm, five actually.
__label__neutral Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
__label__neutral We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
__label__surprise Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
__label__neutral Hey, yknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
__label__neutral Sweety, now, shes a woman, not a gumball machine.
__label__neutral Okay, well yknow what, dont worry you guys, cause Im-Im gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
__label__neutral Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
__label__neutral Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.
__label__neutral So, umm, were kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
__label__non-neutral Whoa!! Thatokay, thats a
__label__neutral No, Im sorry.
__label__surprise Wow! You guys really dont know anything!
__label__non-neutral I know! Why dont you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
__label__neutral Sorry. So hows it going with Joey?
__label__neutral Oh just great.
__label__neutral He beeps me now with codes.
__label__neutral One is, "Bring me food."
__label__neutral Two is, "Im with a girl, bring us food."
__label__neutral Three is, "Im lost and I cant find food."
__label__non-neutral Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
__label__joy Yeah! Shes right in there!
__label__joy Oh great.   Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__surprise You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
__label__disgust Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
__label__non-neutral Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
__label__neutral I don't know, clean places?
__label__neutral Umm, yum!
__label__neutral It's Danny.
__label__fear Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
__label__non-neutral We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?
__label__surprise What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
__label__non-neutral The fake kind!
__label__neutral Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
__label__neutral We have a ladle.
__label__neutral Thanks, see you at the party.
__label__joy Okay, great!
__label__neutral Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
__label__joy You're so efficient. I love you!
__label__joy Let's go!
__label__non-neutral No-no-no! We need something old!
__label__non-neutral Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
__label__joy That'll work!
__label__neutral I don't think so.
__label__joy Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
__label__neutral Here justtake this.
__label__non-neutral That's stealing!
__label__neutral No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
__label__non-neutral Ohh.
__label__neutral Okay, one thing at a time.
__label__neutral Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
__label__joy Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
__label__joy Oh, that's great.
__label__surprise Why are- why are you so tanned?
__label__neutral Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
__label__joy Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk.
__label__non-neutral Oh God, oh.
__label__sadness Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
__label__non-neutral Monica? Monica!
__label__joy Water rules!
__label__neutral Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
__label__neutral Nope. Going to the
__label__non-neutral Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
__label__joy No, it is me!
__label__anger Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in!
__label__non-neutral Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that.
__label__joy I'm- I'm Monana!
__label__neutral Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
__label__joy Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
__label__neutral What?
__label__non-neutral They've arrested Monica.
__label__neutral Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.
__label__neutral Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
__label__neutral No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
__label__neutral Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y.
__label__neutral I just...
__label__neutral I wrote that out phonetically for you.
__label__neutral Phonetically?
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this.
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__surprise Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
__label__non-neutral Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"    I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
__label__surprise Wow. What does
__label__non-neutral No idea!
__label__non-neutral But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
__label__neutral Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
__label__neutral Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .

__label__neutral So umm, does it?
__label__sadness Im sorry.
__label__fear Does it?
__label__neutral Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole Does it? part just another glance.
__label__anger What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!
__label__anger Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesnt, and if you have to even

__label__neutral Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
__label__neutral Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client.
__label__neutral Why dont you tell me what happened.
__label__neutral Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
__label__surprise Im sorry, is this the same Rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
__label__non-neutral Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do
__label__neutral Oh, thats better then.
__label__neutral This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
__label__neutral I see. Have you considered therapy?

__label__neutral No problem.
__label__neutral And well need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
__label__surprise Ooh!
__label__surprise Theres no way to do this without her?
__label__fear Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
__label__neutral But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
__label__neutral Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
__label__neutral That's alright, I'll take it.
__label__neutral Bad things happen to me anyway.
__label__neutral This way I can break 'em up with a movie.

__label__fear Oh God.
__label__non-neutral Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
__label__sadness It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.
__label__sadness And I do, I have to make

__label__neutral We dont, really.
__label__neutral Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah! Yeah, no, were gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
__label__neutral Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars.
__label__neutral And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
__label__non-neutral You know, we dont really take advantage of living in the city.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__neutral Okay, Chandler!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
__label__joy Oh, well thank you in advance.
__label__surprise Op, but the twelfth brings a lovers spat.
__label__surprise Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
__label__neutral Hey guys!
__label__joy Hey!!
__label__surprise Oh my God! Its Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
__label__joy Oh thats right. Its your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
__label__joy Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? Ive dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
__label__neutral No! Joey, youre going to be great!
__label__fear But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I dont know anything about technology!
__label__non-neutral I cant even use Chandlers computer except to find porn!
__label__non-neutral And-and thats only cause its right there when you turn it on!
__label__non-neutral I think our lovers spat will start a little early this month.
__label__neutral Ill be waiting.
__label__non-neutral Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
__label__surprise Oh my God! It sure didnt look this way when I lived here.
__label__surprise I know!
__label__non-neutral Now look, theres only one problem though.
__label__neutral Theres only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joeys.
__label__sadness Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.
__label__non-neutral Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no ones fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
__label__neutral Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
__label__joy Okay!
__label__joy So Rach!

__label__sadness Oh, you have been through so much.
__label__sadness I have.
__label__neutral This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
__label__neutral Sorry, that was wax.

__label__non-neutral During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__sadness Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.
__label__neutral But I'll still always come back, like this.
__label__neutral And sometimes I may be away longer, like this.
__label__neutral But I'll still always come back, like this.
__label__non-neutral And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
__label__joy He is so amazing.
__label__joy Oh, I know. Look at him.
__label__neutral Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.

__label__anger No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
__label__neutral How can I help you?
__label__non-neutral Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section?
__label__non-neutral See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
__label__neutral We are aware of the problem you are referring to.
__label__neutral But as far as increasing security, Im afraid the library is very understaffed.
__label__non-neutral I, I cant help you.
__label__non-neutral Well, fine.
__label__anger Fine!
__label__anger If-if Im the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, Ill go up there and defend it myself!
__label__anger And dont you follow me!
__label__neutral Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
__label__surprise Oh my God! Phoebe look, its Ross and that girl.
__label__surprise No! No! Look at that!  Its a line of ants! Theyre working as a team!
__label__non-neutral Phoebe!

__label__neutral You still work at the multiplex?
__label__joy Oh, like Id give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
__label__neutral Thanks, Im set. Do you still live with your parents?
__label__neutral Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.

__label__neutral Okay.
__label__fear No-no-no-no!
__label__joy YES!!
__label__neutral Uh fellas,
__label__neutral Okay, so he's out of here.
__label__neutral Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
__label__neutral I know it doesn't make much sense
__label__neutral Much
__label__anger Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
__label__non-neutral So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
__label__non-neutral I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!
__label__non-neutral So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.

__label__neutral What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
__label__neutral Nah... not-not special enough.
__label__neutral Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
__label__neutral Waaay too special.

__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__joy The silk? Feels really good!
__label__non-neutral Ah yeah, sorry about that.
__label__neutral Its okay. Come, come on in.
__label__joy Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monicas place was nice, but her fiancée sure stares a lot.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__surprise Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
__label__neutral Uh-huh. Yeah, I-I have a knack for impressions.
__label__joy Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
__label__disgust YeahNo!!

__label__neutral I dont know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
__label__neutral But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
__label__neutral Well, you-you know what I meant.
__label__non-neutral No, you messed it up. Youre stupid.
__label__neutral So what job did you get Joe?
__label__neutral Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
__label__neutral Well, how can you be a tour guide, dont you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
__label__non-neutral I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
__label__neutral Y'know if we ever go to war and youre captured, youre in for a
__label__non-neutral It just keeps getting worse and worse!
__label__neutral Y'know?
__label__neutral I mean its bad enough that Im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, I think she knows.
__label__neutral Because every time were in the room together theres this weird like energy between us.
__label__neutral And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too.
__label__non-neutral And now I have seen her naked.
__label__neutral I mean at least when Ive seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something.
__label__neutral But there are no boles, shes smooth!
__label__neutral Smooth!
__label__surprise Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
__label__surprise Yeah! Oh my God!
__label__surprise So, you and Angela, huh?
__label__joy Yep. Pretty much.
__label__surprise Oh, that's what she meant!
__label__neutral You know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE!
__label__neutral You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion!
__label__neutral Yeah, most of it it's a place
__label__neutral Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
__label__neutral Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison    Avenue.
__label__neutral You know what?
__label__non-neutral She loves architecture, you know what you should do?
__label__joy You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there    there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
__label__surprise Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
__label__neutral But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food...
__label__surprise Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go

__label__neutral Oh yeah, why not?
__label__neutral Pheebs?
__label__neutral No thanks, Ive already seen one.
__label__neutral Okay, umm, Im gonna get my sweater.
__label__non-neutral Okay.  You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
__label__neutral Always.
__label__non-neutral I didnt get the annulment.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__joy Were still married! Dont tell Rachel. See you later.
__label__neutral Hey! Are you okay?
__label__joy Fabulous.
__label__non-neutral Listen, drama critics theyre nothing but, but people who couldnt make it as actors. You know what you should do?
__label__fear Exactly. So you didnt, didnt mention anything to Issac right?
__label__neutral Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
__label__neutral You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we havent actually met...
__label__non-neutral You dog!
__label__neutral Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
__label__neutral Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
__label__neutral Yeah, thats the one. Listen, I dont want to hurt her.
__label__neutral Oh, hey, man I know, doesnt matter how much we love em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
__label__neutral Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
__label__neutral Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. Were the same, you and me.
__label__non-neutral Actually, no, were not.

__label__non-neutral Ooh!
__label__neutral Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it?
__label__neutral Because every time I look at that cover Im like
__label__non-neutral It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
__label__non-neutral Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section

__label__surprise !
__label__surprise What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
__label__non-neutral I cant believe mom and dad are selling the house!

__label__non-neutral Huh?
__label__joy And-and-and I wrote a song for us!
__label__joy (Singing, to the tune of
__label__neutral That's okay.
__label__non-neutral But you haven't even heard the chorus!
__label__non-neutral Well, shell understand right? Its not like I did it on purpose.
__label__neutral Dad, that wont matter to her.
__label__non-neutral Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all hers is-is, is growing new stuff!
__label__non-neutral See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
__label__surprise Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
__label__non-neutral Well, can you blame her?
__label__joy Well I dont know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could

__label__joy Yknow Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
__label__surprise You could?
__label__joy Yeah! Ive been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
__label__surprise Your own boat?
__label__surprise What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
__label__joy Hes coming here for Thanksgiving!
__label__non-neutral Count in our heads as-as good
__label__neutral I guess I'm done.

__label__joy Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun!  Ohhh!
__label__neutral Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it
__label__neutral Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
__label__neutral Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
__label__neutral Do you want a date Saturday?
__label__neutral Yes please.
__label__neutral Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
__label__surprise He's a he?

__label__disgust Okay, goodbye...
__label__sadness Well, it's official there are no good movies.
__label__neutral Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
__label__neutral Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back.
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey, man. What's up?
__label__neutral Maybe you can tell me.
__label__non-neutral My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today.
__label__non-neutral The first good thing she gets me in weeks.
__label__anger How could you not give me the message?
__label__non-neutral !
__label__non-neutral Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
__label__non-neutral Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!
__label__neutral See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
__label__neutral Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
__label__surprise Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
__label__non-neutral Theres this kid in my class who said hes in love with me.
__label__surprise Whoa!
__label__surprise Whoa what?
__label__neutral Ross has a boyfriend.
__label__joy I do-I do
__label__surprise Really?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral I dont know.
__label__non-neutral I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid.
__label__non-neutral What-what-what-what is it?!
__label__non-neutral Am I giving out some kind ofsexy professor vibe?
__label__neutral Not right now.
__label__non-neutral It-itThe point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
__label__sadness Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid!
__label__non-neutral I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard!
__label__neutral Yknow youI couldnt concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me.
__label__non-neutral I mean come on, you remember whats its like to be 19 and in love.
__label__joy Oh yes! Thank you very much!  Oh thats-thats actually how the French drink it.
__label__joy A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man!  Yes!
__label__joy Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
__label__joy That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
__label__neutral Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
__label__neutral Pick a number! That is your
__label__joy 8. 8!
__label__joy Thank you!
__label__joy If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
__label__neutral Yeah, I understand.
__label__neutral Take as much time as you want.
__label__neutral Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it.
__label__non-neutral Ill be here.
__label__sadness Not smoking.
__label__surprise Were really gonna do this, huh?
__label__neutral Looks like it.
__label__neutral Yknow, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at

__label__neutral Okay.
__label__joy Susan! Hi!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Thank you so much for coming.
__label__joy Oh, I wouldnt miss it for the world.
__label__neutral Im-Im Ross by the way.
__label__joy Hello Ross.  I love what youve done with this space.
__label__joy Thank you so much.
__label__surprise How hot is this?!
__label__neutral Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm
__label__neutral G.I. Joe
__label__joy Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
__label__sadness It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
__label__disgust That, that's what's stupid.
__label__neutral I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers.
__label__neutral And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
__label__non-neutral Down at the docks again?
__label__neutral Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
__label__anger Im not gonna tell you! Youre the bad man who broke Sarahs leg.
__label__non-neutral Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
__label__anger Youre a big scrud.
__label__neutral Whats a scrud?
__label__anger Why dont you look in the mirror, scrud.
__label__non-neutral I dont have too. I can just look at you.
__label__non-neutral All right girls, and man. Lets see your final tallies.  Ohhhh, Debbie,  321 boxes of cookies,  Very nice.
__label__non-neutral Not nice enough.
__label__neutral Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
__label__neutral So, howd the lasagne go over?
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Good.
__label__neutral So you owe me three pretty things.
__label__neutral Yeah, Ive been thinking a lot about you too.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__sadness Its hard this whole platonic thing.
__label__surprise Its a word!
__label__neutral Yeah, I do think its better this way.  Yeah, were being smart.   Yes, Im sure.
__label__neutral You really sure?
__label__neutral Ill call you back.
__label__surprise So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
__label__neutral Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
__label__neutral Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.
__label__neutral But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary.
__label__neutral I am
__label__neutral I think you're better than you think you are.
__label__surprise Really? Okay, so
__label__neutral Know when to stop.
__label__neutral Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
__label__neutral Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen.  Don't do the dance.
__label__joy Right!

__label__surprise Are you being British?!
__label__neutral No. Not anymore.
__label__surprise Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
__label__neutral Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
__label__non-neutral Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
__label__non-neutral Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
__label__neutral Where is this party?
__label__neutral Here in Chelsea.
__label__non-neutral Who's party is it?
__label__neutral A woman's
__label__anger What woman?!
__label__neutral Chelsea.
__label__neutral Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here.
__label__disgust Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet.
__label__disgust Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle.
__label__non-neutral So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
__label__non-neutral Can I be that guy?
__label__joy Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
__label__non-neutral Yknow uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
__label__non-neutral Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
__label__surprise Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I dont feel that way about you.
__label__non-neutral Oh no-no-no, thats notNo-no-no!
__label__non-neutral Did you just flick me?
__label__non-neutral OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]
__label__anger Oh!  All right.  Now, let's not do this!
__label__non-neutral Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!
__label__anger OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
__label__non-neutral Ow! Ow! Ow!
__label__non-neutral I know!  I know!  I know!
__label__neutral Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
__label__anger Fine!
__label__anger Fine!
__label__neutral There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
__label__neutral Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on.

__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__sadness Hi, listen, Im sorry about before.

__label__surprise Really?
__label__non-neutral Yeah! Oh yes!
__label__neutral Ohh.
__label__joy Listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
__label__joy Thats a great idea! We can
__label__joy Totally!
__label__neutral We dont have to come up with this now.
__label__joy Oh good.
__label__neutral Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
__label__joy Thats great. Good for you guys.
__label__anger I am not high maintenance!
__label__anger I am not a pushover!
__label__non-neutral Who said you were?
__label__anger You did!
__label__neutral Oh, Im flaky. Ill say anything.
__label__non-neutral Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
__label__neutral That does not sound stupid to me.
__label__neutral You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?
__label__sadness I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.
__label__neutral Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
__label__non-neutral What uh-oh?
__label__non-neutral Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done.

__label__non-neutral Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
__label__neutral Okay,
__label__anger Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
__label__disgust Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
__label__non-neutral Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
__label__anger Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
__label__anger Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
__label__anger I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
__label__non-neutral Do not speak ill of the dead.
__label__anger We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
__label__non-neutral I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
__label__anger What did you say?
__label__fear I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
__label__neutral Yknow, maybe its best that we never got to do it again.
__label__neutral Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Yknow, technically we still
__label__neutral Im gonna go to the bathroom, maybe Ill see you there in a bit?
__label__neutral Kay!
__label__neutral Can I ask you something?
__label__neutral Uhh, no.
__label__neutral Felicity and I, were watching

__label__neutral Yes.
__label__neutral Thanks man.
__label__neutral Okay man.
__label__neutral But what about how much taller he is than me?
__label__neutral I mean, theres no way I can make myself taller now, yknow?
__label__non-neutral And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
__label__surprise Hey, Monica, wow youve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
__label__non-neutral I know!
__label__neutral Had the beef-tips, huh?

__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise Hey, how, how did you do that?
__label__neutral Alright, somebody.
__label__neutral OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
__label__surprise Whoooaa!
__label__neutral That's my sister.
__label__neutral OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
__label__surprise Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
__label__neutral Pheebs, what about you?
__label__neutral Oh... Milwaukee.
__label__neutral Um... Ross?
__label__neutral Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
__label__surprise No way!
__label__neutral The ride broke down.
__label__non-neutral So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
__label__neutral Oh, Rachel.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Oh, is the play over?
__label__neutral Yeah. Where were you?
__label__neutral Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller.
__label__non-neutral You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
__label__neutral Nah. I kept myself busy.
__label__neutral Oh, okay, yeah.  I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
__label__neutral Well theres yore. And uh, yknow, yesteryear.
__label__neutral Yeah no, Im telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff.
__label__neutral Ross, yknow if you ever decide you need to redecorateAnd I think that you should.
__label__neutral You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
__label__neutral Oh honey he doesnt need my help.
__label__non-neutral Oh, come on! I think hes ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__surprise Hey, yknow what?
__label__neutral Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, heres-heres 60 bucks, why dont you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
__label__non-neutral Yknow what? I dont, I dont think Phoebe really wants to come.
__label__joy No! I do want to!
__label__neutral Oh, she does want to.
__label__neutral She does want to.
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__surprise Wow, you have really pretty feet.
__label__non-neutral These old things.
__label__non-neutral Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, its been killing me today.
__label__neutral You mean theOkay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get yknow, real  nice and tight.
__label__surprise So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
__label__neutral Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__surprise Ow! Did you just bite me?
__label__surprise No!
__label__neutral Um, that's it.
__label__neutral No.
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__surprise You!
__label__neutral J.
__label__neutral Crew guy.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral Why have you been following me?
__label__non-neutral I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
__label__sadness You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
__label__surprise What?
__label__sadness One more chance Ursula, please?
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.
__label__joy Good deal.
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Hi! All right, lets go shoppin!!
__label__fear Um, y'know, before we go ah, theres something I need to say.
__label__neutral Oh, okay.
__label__fear Ive kinda of had this ah, this crush on you.
__label__non-neutral But since you were with Ross, I-I didnt do anything about it.
__label__fear But, now that youre not, Id really like to ask you out sometime.
__label__fear So-so thats-thats what Im doing, now.
__label__surprise Wow! Umm....
__label__neutral I dropped a cup.
__label__neutral Hello, tiny embryos.
__label__joy Well, Im-Im Phoebe Buffay, hi!
__label__joy Im-Im-Im hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months.
__label__joy You should know, that were doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, youve been there!
__label__joy Umm, yknow they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on.
__label__joy Okay, and-and I promise that Ill keep you safe and warm until youre ready to have them take you home, so Oh!
__label__neutral And also, umm next time you see me, Im screaming, dont worry, thats whats supposed to happen.
__label__neutral Ready?
__label__non-neutral Uh-huh.  Good luck.
__label__joy We're baack!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__surprise What are you guys doing together?
__label__neutral Joey and Janice's
__label__surprise Really.
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah.
__label__joy We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman.
__label__neutral You have got competition buddy.
__label__neutral I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so.
__label__neutral I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
__label__neutral You still can't stand her can you?
__label__sadness I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
__label__neutral Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
__label__non-neutral But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she.
__label__neutral It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
__label__surprise You told him to play the boxer gay!!
__label__non-neutral Well, I-I mightve said supergay.
__label__non-neutral You totally screwed him over.
__label__anger Joey, youre this guys teacher. I mean how could you do this?
__label__neutral Because, Monica, the guys so good, and I really, really want this part.
__label__neutral Well, if you really, really want it, then its okay.
__label__neutral Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
__label__non-neutral Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so
__label__neutral I'm not your brother.
__label__anger What about my children Drake?! Huh!?  No!! No!! No! God!
__label__neutral Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.
__label__anger Are you kidding me?!
__label__non-neutral It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!
__label__non-neutral I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!
__label__neutral Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
__label__neutral Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
__label__neutral Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
__label__neutral Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
__label__neutral Is there something wrong?
__label__neutral All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay?
__label__neutral You're hot.
__label__neutral I'm lovable.
__label__neutral Clearly there's a vibe going on between us.
__label__neutral But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
__label__neutral Joey...
__label__non-neutral Oh no its not, no its not. Its a first date. Im
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__joy Ho-oh, hes gonna get some!
__label__neutral Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment.
__label__neutral Yknow so umm, hes closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister.
__label__neutral Well, Im off to bed!
__label__joy You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
__label__joy Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
__label__joy No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
__label__fear Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__non-neutral Umm, look I like you.
__label__non-neutral I-I really do, I like you a lot.
__label__non-neutral Okay?
__label__non-neutral But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very
__label__surprise Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
__label__surprise Oh, Joey! Sorry!
__label__joy They made you head of the department!
__label__non-neutral No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!  Why didnt I get head of the department?
__label__neutral Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
__label__neutral Uh, Pauls Café. They got great food and its really romantic.
__label__joy Ooh, great! Thanks!
__label__neutral Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the
__label__neutral You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, Ill tell ya
__label__sadness Ooh, I miss dating.
__label__neutral Gettin all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant.
__label__joy Im not gonna be able to do that for so long, and its so much fun!
__label__neutral I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
__label__neutral Hey, yknow what?
__label__neutral Huh?
__label__neutral Why dont I take you out?
__label__surprise What?! Joey, you dont want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
__label__joy Yes I do!
__label__joy And were gonna go out, were gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out
__label__joy Okay! Ill go with ya! Ill go! Ill go with ya.
__label__neutral Ill be fun.
__label__neutral All right?
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking
__label__joy Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good,    and... and my co-star's good
__label__joy God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
__label__non-neutral Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with    me?
__label__non-neutral Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
__label__neutral Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
__label__anger Oh screw her, that part is mine!
__label__neutral Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
__label__surprise Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you    here.
__label__surprise I can't believe you married him.
__label__non-neutral But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a
__label__sadness So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
__label__non-neutral It's over! You
__label__surprise How can I?
__label__sadness Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?
__label__sadness How can I accept that...
__label__sadness I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.
__label__joy Kiss me.
__label__surprise What?
__label__joy Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
__label__neutral The bigger half.
__label__joy I'd like to propose a toast.
__label__joy Little toast here, ding ding.
__label__joy I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
__label__non-neutral Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
__label__joy So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
__label__joy That's so sweet.
__label__joy And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
__label__joy And a crappy New Year.
__label__joy Here, here!
__label__anger Now, hold on!
__label__anger Hold on!
__label__anger Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that Im gonna be at that airport and I hope that shell be there too!
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah, I said Rachels name, but it didnt mean anything, Okay?
__label__non-neutral Shes-shes just a friend and thats all!
__label__non-neutral Thats all!
__label__non-neutral Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I cant imagine spending my life with anyone else.
__label__sadness Please, promise me that youll tell her that.
__label__non-neutral All right, Ill tell her.  Come on bugger face!
__label__neutral Call me.
__label__anger You spend half your life in the bathroom, why dont you ever go out the bloody window!
__label__surprise What happened?!!
__label__surprise Well, I dont know!!
__label__neutral We fell asleep! That is all.
__label__neutral Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, Id better go.
__label__neutral I think that would be best.
__label__neutral Yeah. All right, Ill talk to you later.
__label__non-neutral Okay. But not about this!
__label__non-neutral No! Never! Never!  Bye.
__label__non-neutral No touch! No touch!
__label__sadness Umm ma'am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral It's a funny story, actually.
__label__neutral I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really  know what I was saying.
__label__surprise You fell asleep?
__label__fear But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain't that funny?
__label__surprise Irony?
__label__neutral Not a fan, alright .
__label__neutral See, here's  the thing.
__label__neutral I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go.
__label__joy See, me, I  love Tulsa!
__label__joy Tulsa is heaven!
__label__fear Tulsa is Italy—Please don't make me go  there!
__label__non-neutral Chandler, I…
__label__fear No no no!
__label__neutral Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?
__label__non-neutral Wh-why  would I when your name is Elaine?
__label__non-neutral Oh what a great picture of your son,  strapping!
__label__non-neutral That's a picture of your daughter, isn't it,  well she's lovely.
__label__non-neutral I like a girl with a strong jaw.
__label__neutral I'll call you from Tulsa.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral How are you?
__label__neutral I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
__label__neutral Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
__label__surprise That I was not expecting.
__label__neutral I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
__label__neutral Oh. Thanks.
__label__joy No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing
__label__neutral Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
__label__surprise I just can't believe you're in here.
__label__sadness I mean, what am I gonna do without you?
__label__non-neutral Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?
__label__non-neutral Who's gonna take me to the
__label__disgust Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
__label__neutral What do you mean?
__label__neutral Smell familiar?
__label__fear Oh no.
__label__sadness Oh, I am so sorry.
__label__sadness No me, I am so sorry...
__label__surprise Oh my.
__label__fear Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot.
__label__fear Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
__label__neutral Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
__label__neutral Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
__label__neutral My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
__label__neutral No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
__label__neutral Tho?
__label__non-neutral Ohhh.
__label__neutral That's good, have a seat.
__label__neutral Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle.
__label__neutral You're just gonna have to be brave, ok?
__label__neutral Can you do that for me?
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__neutral Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?
__label__fear Yes!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.
__label__anger Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!
__label__anger Oh, Ross!
__label__anger Let go of my hand!
__label__joy Youre gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!
__label__joy Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
__label__neutral Welllets just say
__label__joy Oo, where are the seats?
__label__neutral Uh, middle balcony.
__label__anger Youre a mean old woman.
__label__non-neutral No! Wait no! Shut upI mean dont cry! Let me get my checkbook!
__label__non-neutral Look honey, you dont have to do this, okay?
__label__joy Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me.
__label__joy Youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity!
__label__joy Thats the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
__label__anger That means nothing to me.  Come on!
__label__non-neutral Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
__label__neutral : Hey.
__label__neutral : What are you doing?
__label__non-neutral Ummm. Oh! Im sorry.  Its a little old but
__label__anger : No! Youre clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
__label__sadness Im sorry. I didntI dont come in here a lot.
__label__anger : Oh yeah, of course you dont!
__label__neutral No.
__label__disgust : Cause youre a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of
__label__non-neutral I didnt I never said that.
__label__anger : You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh?
__label__anger Well, why dont think of someone else for a change?
__label__sadness Okay, Im sorry.
__label__non-neutral Hello!
__label__neutral What's this?
__label__neutral Oh right its that girl's phone number.
__label__non-neutral Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me.
__label__surprise It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa!
__label__joy Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__surprise I dont know how any of these got opened?!
__label__surprise You opened them all?
__label__non-neutral I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!
__label__joy Oh hey! You got my parents gift!
__label__neutral Yeah. What is that?
__label__non-neutral Well, I dont know. I think it does something to salami.
__label__non-neutral Hey! Howd it go?
__label__neutral Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
__label__non-neutral Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
__label__joy I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you.
__label__surprise Oh wow, you didnt even try to unhook my bra!
__label__neutral So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
__label__non-neutral No, I will. Im just not up for it tonight.
__label__non-neutral Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know youre not gonna be alone in this.
__label__surprise Im not?
__label__fear Listen I uh  Its a scary world out there especially if youre a single mom.
__label__non-neutral Yknow, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond.
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__joy So,  Rachel Green will you marry me?
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__anger If I cant have it you cant have it!
__label__disgust I cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical.
__label__neutral Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget.
__label__neutral There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and
__label__neutral Paris?
__label__neutral We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
__label__neutral Keep talking.
__label__joy Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because its romantic, but because I can!
__label__joy I love you!
__label__joy Yes!
__label__joy I win again!
__label__joy Ha-ha!
__label__joy Thats like 500 bucks you owe me!
__label__joy Whoo-ho-hoo!
__label__joy $500 that is a loooot of electricity!
__label__joy Whoo-ho-ho!
__label__neutral I gotta buy some food.
__label__non-neutral Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
__label__surprise You serious?
__label__non-neutral Oh yes!
__label__joy Okay, get ready to owe me!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay, here we go. Ready?
__label__non-neutral No! No! No! Noone can beat me.
__label__non-neutral See? Now, thats why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
__label__surprise Who is that?!
__label__non-neutral Dont worry, Im brave!
__label__fear I am brave!
__label__fear II am brave!
__label__fear No-no-no-no!!
__label__neutral Can you tell me who is there please?
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Hi. Do you know what time it is?
__label__joy Its candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
__label__joy Oh please!  Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
__label__neutral 4:00 A.M.
__label__neutral So, can I get some candy?
__label__neutral I am sorry, but some of us have to
__label__sadness Umm, listen I am sorry, but Ill put some out first thing in the morning.
__label__neutral Well okay, Ill swing by later. Do you live in this building?
__label__neutral Um-hmm.
__label__surprise Mm! Seems like I wouldve remembered you!
__label__neutral Mm! Night Gar!
__label__non-neutral Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guys hammered!
__label__neutral Im sorry Joey, as long as hes here and hes conscious were still shooting.
__label__neutral You wouldnt happen to have a very big fork?
__label__neutral So I uh, I just talked to the director. Thats it, were done for the day.
__label__surprise Well have we finished the scene?
__label__joy Yeah! Youyou were wonderful.
__label__neutral As were you.
__label__neutral So I got your car, its right outside.
__label__surprise Why? Are we done for the day?
__label__neutral Thats what you told me.
__label__non-neutral Oh, thank you. Youre welcome.
__label__fear No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on!  Here we go.
__label__non-neutral Is that my ass?
__label__neutral What about these? These look the same?
__label__joy Definitely!
__label__neutral Not as each other!
__label__neutral Oh, then no.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hi!
__label__neutral You ready?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
__label__joy Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
__label__neutral Let me see the earrings.
__label__neutral Oh, honey, the earrings
__label__joy They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
__label__joy My boyfriend really does have good taste!
__label__neutral Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
__label__neutral Hm-mmm.
__label__neutral I know that theres no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Look at this!
__label__neutral Okay, but there
__label__anger I dont care! The wires have come loose in your head!
__label__neutral I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
__label__non-neutral And did you?!
__label__neutral No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
__label__neutral But it didnt. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral Hello darling.
__label__neutral Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
__label__neutral Okay, is everybody clear? Were gonna pick it upand move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? Were gonna
__label__neutral Ross, I really dont think
__label__joy Lift!! And slide!
__label__neutral Okay, here we go.
__label__joy All right everyone, lift!  And slide!!
__label__neutral All right Carl, were next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
__label__neutral Another
__label__neutral Thats right! And what are you not gonna do?
__label__neutral Well, Im not gonna talk because
__label__sadness I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but
__label__non-neutral Ohmy Gawd, I-I understand.
__label__sadness I-I am so sorry, Ill go.
__label__sadness Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.
__label__neutral Chandler,  you call me when this goes in the pooper.
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__joy I found my identical hand twin!
__label__neutral Ohh, you are
__label__neutral No!
__label__surprise But she just came up here!
__label__neutral That was Joey!
__label__neutral I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
__label__neutral Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
__label__anger Would you stop that!
__label__neutral Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard?
__label__neutral She didn't feel anything for him.
__label__non-neutral She loves you!
__label__surprise Really?
__label__non-neutral Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Good.  I should really start wearing hats!
__label__neutral I mean, why should I let them meet him?
__label__disgust I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him.
__label__non-neutral I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
__label__neutral Listen.
__label__neutral As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.
__label__neutral I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
__label__sadness I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
__label__neutral Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
__label__non-neutral No-no-no-no.  Hey!
__label__neutral Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
__label__neutral Hey sweetie.
__label__neutral Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
__label__neutral I cant tell you. Its a secret.

__label__joy Grandmas gonna have to get in line.
__label__non-neutral Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
__label__surprise What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
__label__neutral Who?
__label__neutral Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyones name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames.
__label__neutral Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
__label__neutral Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
__label__neutral Umm, no. No.
__label__surprise Yes you did! What was it?

__label__non-neutral No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
__label__neutral Okay, what else?
__label__neutral Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'

__label__joy Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
__label__surprise You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
__label__surprise What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
__label__disgust Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
__label__neutral What are you saying I should do?
__label__neutral I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
__label__joy Thank you, Monica.
__label__neutral Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
__label__non-neutral Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.

__label__surprise Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
__label__neutral Oh, which museum?
__label__neutral No, answer his.
__label__joy Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars.
__label__joy She was totally at my mercy.
__label__non-neutral Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
__label__neutral No, Im getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie.
__label__non-neutral She seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
__label__non-neutral How can she be great if shes from Poughkeepsie?  That joke wouldve killed in Albany.

__label__neutral Oh, yeah, sure.
__label__neutral I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, shes crying out, Where are they, where are they?
__label__neutral Well, shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
__label__non-neutral Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral You see, now, I would date this girl.
__label__neutral Shes cute, shes outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire.
__label__neutral I mean, thats got to come in handy
__label__neutral Okay, Ive got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?

__label__neutral 2:17.
__label__surprise Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
__label__surprise Are you serious?!
__label__neutral Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
__label__surprise Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
__label__non-neutral Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
__label__neutral Hey, you guys

__label__neutral And-
__label__neutral Yeah, can I help you with something?
__label__non-neutral Look, Im talking right now! Youreyou mean her.

__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hi Pheebs!
__label__neutral Are you moving out?
__label__neutral No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's.
__label__neutral Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
__label__neutral Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
__label__fear Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,
__label__non-neutral Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
__label__neutral Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me.
__label__neutral One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
__label__surprise Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
__label__non-neutral Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
__label__surprise All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
__label__neutral Which proves that I never lie.
__label__neutral I guess you don't.
__label__non-neutral Paolo made a pass at me.
__label__fear Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
__label__neutral Im not freaking out.
__label__neutral Why would I be freaking out?
__label__neutral A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
__label__non-neutral Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!
__label__neutral I mean, whats the harm in that?
__label__non-neutral Right here!
__label__non-neutral Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel
__label__non-neutral Phoebe and Rachel!
__label__non-neutral So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
__label__non-neutral It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Really?
__label__neutral Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that Im just not ready
__label__neutral I know! I know.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Im gonna go tell Joey that  that youre back. I was really worried about you.
__label__neutral Hey, did she buy it?
__label__neutral Totally.
__label__neutral So did Heldi show you the place?
__label__neutral Yeah, its beautiful.
__label__joy I cant believe youre gonna ask Monica to marry you!
__label__neutral I know.
__label__anger No Phoebe!
__label__anger You cannot get the phone that way; thats not fair!
__label__neutral Okay look, I have an idea.
__label__neutral Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.
__label__neutral And then whoever does gets the phone.
__label__neutral Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
__label__non-neutral I dont think so.
__label__anger Fine all right, but Id bet youd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
__label__neutral All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
__label__sadness Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
__label__non-neutral Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
__label__sadness Did I use that already today? Im sorry.
__label__neutral Yes okay.
__label__non-neutral Well now see this isnt telling us anything.
__label__neutral Joe.
__label__neutral Carlos.
__label__neutral Peter.
__label__surprise Ooh!
__label__surprise Peter Luger!
__label__non-neutral T hats a steak house!
__label__neutral Okay, a meat eater. Fine, thats one for you.
__label__joy Oh, I win! Hes got
__label__neutral So you dont know thats
__label__surprise His new girlfriend!
__label__surprise I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
__label__non-neutral I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.
__label__non-neutral Shes saving the rest for her divorce.
__label__neutral And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to
__label__neutral Well what happened at dinner?
__label__non-neutral My parents spent the money for our wedding!
__label__surprise My God! What did you order?!
__label__sadness Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
__label__neutral Honey, its gonna be okay.
__label__sadness No! No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
__label__neutral No, yknow what?
__label__neutral Its gonna be okay.
__label__neutral I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast.
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__neutral And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
__label__neutral Dr. Geller, theres a seat over here.
__label__neutral Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Im having my lunch at this table, here in the middle.
__label__neutral Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hell sit with me.
__label__neutral I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
__label__neutral Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.
__label__sadness Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow what I see, I see-I see division.
__label__non-neutral Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!"
__label__neutral Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.
__label__joy Im Ross!
__label__joy Im divorced, and I have a kid!
__label__joy Im Joey! Im an actor! I dont know squat about dinosaurs!
__label__non-neutral Im Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
__label__joy All right, there you go!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
__label__neutral Im Andrew, and I didnt pay for this pear.
__label__non-neutral Okay, good-good for you.
__label__neutral Im Rhonda,  and these arent real!
__label__surprise Wow, Rhonda.
__label__neutral Im Scott.
__label__neutral Yeah, okay, Scott!
__label__fear And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
__label__neutral So thanks for the warm welcome.
__label__joy Its good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play.
__label__neutral I hope you do too.
__label__joy Now, lets go out there and get em!
__label__surprise Huh?
__label__neutral And remember, there is no I in team.
__label__joy Yes, but theres two in martini, soo everybody

__label__joy I like funny.
__label__joy This team is about hard work, but its also about having fun.
__label__joy Good to have you aboard Bing!
__label__neutral Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
__label__neutral So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
__label__neutral They're gonna call her Chandler.
__label__neutral That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
__label__neutral Works on you.
__label__joy Oh, that is so sweet.
__label__joy No, no, ok, you hang up.
__label__joy Ok, ok, one, two, three.
__label__joy Well you didn't hang up either.
__label__joy She didn't hang up either...

__label__surprise When, when were you... under me?
__label__non-neutral Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
__label__surprise OK, I need to lie down.
__label__joy Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
__label__joy Really? That's great!
__label__joy I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her
__label__neutral (noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks,
__label__non-neutral Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one.
__label__non-neutral Ben is way cuter than that kid.
__label__disgust I mean look at him, look at you,
__label__neutral That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
__label__neutral Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
__label__non-neutral I look more like him than you do!
__label__non-neutral Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
__label__joy That really was some of your best work.
__label__non-neutral Hm-hmm, I told you!  I cant believe that Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
__label__neutral I have to be up in seven minutes.
__label__neutral Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Do you wanna?
__label__joy Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and Ill get the furniture polish!
__label__neutral Oh okay. But yknow what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
__label__surprise Boyfriend?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Im Joey.
__label__neutral Kristen.
__label__joy Oh wow, what a beautiful name!  What is it again?
__label__neutral Kristen.
__label__neutral Got it!  So
__label__neutral So uh, do you live around here?
__label__neutral Yeah!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Right down there.
__label__neutral Hey listen; let me give you a little tip.
__label__non-neutral Do not take a nap on this stoop  or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
__label__neutral Ill remember that.
__label__neutral Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
__label__neutral Oh I, I have plans tonight.
__label__sadness Oh.
__label__neutral But how about tomorrow?
__label__joy Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go?
__label__neutral You look strong, why dont I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
__label__neutral Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, Ill grab this one.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Listen, um...
__label__sadness I'm sorry.
__label__neutral : Yeah, um...  You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin'
__label__non-neutral That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
__label__neutral Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
__label__neutral If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
__label__non-neutral Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
__label__sadness You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
__label__neutral By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
__label__non-neutral Oh, hello liar.
__label__sadness Look, I-Im really sorry I let go of the bike.
__label__anger I couldve been killed I hope you know!
__label__sadness I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were
__label__non-neutral Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
__label__neutral Phoebe.
__label__anger What?!  What the hell?!
__label__anger All right, yknow what?
__label__anger If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then Im sorry, Im just gonna have to take it back.
__label__surprise What?! Why?!
__label__anger Because! Because, it-it-its Itd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar
__label__anger All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
__label__non-neutral Great! Great!  Youre making the bike very happy.
__label__non-neutral Okay Ross!  Please dont die!
__label__non-neutral How could you have kept all of this from me?
__label__neutral I was going to tell you, but
__label__anger But what?! You figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
__label__anger Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just  Why dont we just let the machine get that?
__label__neutral Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it.
__label__non-neutral No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-II need to, I need to lie down.
__label__joy Everything on your application looks really goodOhh!
__label__non-neutral Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
__label__neutral Oh dont worry, Im not really a party girl.
__label__non-neutral Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
__label__joy You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! Ill be living here.
__label__non-neutral Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it.
__label__surprise Why did you take the shower curtain down?
__label__fear That thing was a hazard!  Im very safety conscious.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hey man, how did the audition go?
__label__sadness Estelle said I didn't get it.
__label__surprise What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
__label__surprise No!
__label__neutral For all I know, shes trying to find me but couldnt because I kept moving around.
__label__neutral No, from now on, Im staying in one place.
__label__neutral Right here.
__label__neutral Well, its getting late.
__label__neutral Yeah, were gonna go.
__label__neutral Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
__label__neutral Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
__label__neutral Yeah, its a very large plane.
__label__neutral Thats cool.
__label__neutral But, well stay here with you.
__label__joy Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, yknow, but you dont have to rub my butt.
__label__surprise Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
__label__surprise Theyre not a couple!
__label__neutral Oh-okay, I get the game now.
__label__neutral Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
__label__joy Oh yeah!
__label__neutral Well okay, so then youre fine.
__label__neutral The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.
__label__neutral Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Noooo!!
__label__surprise Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, its me! Phoebe!
__label__neutral Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.
__label__surprise Wait a second! So, whats new with you?
__label__neutral Umm, nothing. I mean, Im getting married next week.
__label__surprise And your breasts! Hmm!!!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Umm look, youre coming on a little strong.
__label__neutral But Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together.
__label__neutral So, why dont we just start over okay?
__label__neutral And you can just tell me about yourself.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral I write erotic novels, for children.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Theyre wildly unpopular.
__label__disgust Oh my God!
__label__neutral Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
__label__surprise Wow! You do?
__label__joy Yeah,  a Pretty Huge
__label__disgust All right.
__label__non-neutral So, uh, how's she doing?
__label__sadness The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
__label__non-neutral How-how are you, Mom?
__label__non-neutral Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise What's different?
__label__neutral Nothing.
__label__neutral Oh, maybe that's it.
__label__non-neutral She is unbelievable, our mother is...
__label__neutral Okay, relax, relax.
__label__neutral We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
__label__surprise Oh God!
__label__neutral The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__disgust ...Yeah, they were gross.
__label__joy Oh, you know what I loved?
__label__joy Her Sweet 'n' Los.
__label__joy How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
__label__neutral Not just restaurants, from our house.
__label__neutral Maybe.
__label__surprise You can't!
__label__surprise Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said.
__label__neutral In the hall.
__label__neutral Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.
__label__neutral But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.
__label__neutral Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
__label__neutral Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
__label__joy That's a good one!
__label__neutral Hey, Joe.
__label__neutral Dad, Ronni's here.
__label__surprise Huh?
__label__neutral So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal.
__label__neutral Anything at all.
__label__neutral But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
__label__joy Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
__label__anger Im Monicas maid of honor. Okay? Dont try to blue pin me!
__label__neutral Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.
__label__non-neutral Limited seating my ass. Lets see who made the cut.  Hi!
__label__neutral Im Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
__label__non-neutral Used to work with her. Used to! Im a relative and I didnt get invited! A
__label__non-neutral Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
__label__joy So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
__label__neutral Okay, youre fine.
__label__surprise Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
__label__neutral Youll see.
__label__non-neutral I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
__label__non-neutral Oh God.
__label__neutral Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and yknow fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles
__label__neutral And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and  You go.
__label__neutral But-but, if you dont love this, well do it in any other place at any other time.
__label__neutral Really, its fine, whatever you want.
__label__joy Its perfect.
__label__non-neutral And, I dont know, if it starts to rain
__label__non-neutral Well then well get wet.
__label__sadness Ohh. And I dont even have a date.
__label__neutral Coming.
__label__anger I have a bone to pick with you.
__label__fear Uh-oh.
__label__non-neutral Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
__label__surprise Oh yeah? Did he pull the old
__label__joy Thats right! Thats right!
__label__neutral Oh that.
__label__anger Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! Theyre mean and theyre stupid and-and I dont want my son learning them!
__label__anger Yknow what? It doesnt matter! Because it is not true!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral And if it were true, how
__label__neutral Ms. Monroe  Oh there you go.
__label__surprise Mark's a genius!
__label__surprise Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
__label__non-neutral Look, don't you see what's happening here.
__label__non-neutral Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.
__label__neutral Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
__label__fear What am I going to do?
__label__neutral Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.
__label__neutral All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
__label__fear I don't know you guys.
__label__disgust All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.
__label__disgust And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
__label__non-neutral And before you know it, she's with him.
__label__non-neutral And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'
__label__non-neutral And he'll be all, 'Yes!'
__label__non-neutral And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'
__label__disgust And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'
__label__disgust And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
__label__non-neutral He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
__label__neutral This is what Ive got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
__label__neutral Great. Great.
__label__neutral Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, Ive got you, me, and Chandler and Im gonna invite Gunther cause, well, weve been talking about this pretty loud.
__label__neutral Ill be there.
__label__non-neutral All rightoh!
__label__neutral Listen, I know this is your party, but Id really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
__label__neutral Yeah. Tell ya what, lets not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
__label__neutral Okay! Well need a six-pack of
__label__neutral Hey guys, what are you doing?
__label__neutral Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.
__label__non-neutral Oh, come on!
__label__neutral Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him.
__label__neutral Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there.
__label__neutral Well, Chandler will be there for you too.
__label__neutral I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, hell be there.
__label__neutral And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot.
__label__neutral What do ya say? What do ya say?
__label__neutral Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.
__label__neutral But, all right, I dontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk.
__label__non-neutral I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to name my kid!
__label__non-neutral What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
__label__surprise I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
__label__non-neutral Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
__label__surprise What's that supposed to mean?
__label__neutral Nothing! It's an expression.
__label__neutral No it's not.
__label__neutral Don't listen to your mother.
__label__neutral You're independent, and you always have been!
__label__non-neutral Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!
__label__neutral And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
__label__neutral PBS Telethon.
__label__neutral Hi Joey.
__label__joy Hey Pheebs!
__label__neutral I
__label__surprise $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what
__label__non-neutral Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not
__label__surprise What kind of problem?
__label__non-neutral Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral Nooooo!
__label__non-neutral Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
__label__non-neutral Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
__label__non-neutral I don't wanna give up the bag.
__label__anger I don't have to give up the bag!
__label__non-neutral Do I Rach?
__label__anger Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
__label__neutral Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it
__label__surprise Oh, hey!
__label__non-neutral I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
__label__non-neutral I can't believe I'm hearing this!
__label__non-neutral Wait a minute!
__label__non-neutral Wait a minute!
__label__neutral I'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.
__label__neutral Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
__label__neutral I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
__label__joy Okay, great.
__label__neutral They say he's only got half a tank left.
__label__surprise Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
__label__non-neutral We're switching rooms again.
__label__surprise What? Why?
__label__anger This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
__label__non-neutral Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
__label__non-neutral Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__non-neutral Chandler!
__label__anger Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
__label__anger Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
__label__surprise Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
__label__joy Hey!
__label__surprise Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didnt think you were coming.
__label__joy Oh, I wouldnt miss this.
__label__joy Well, Im very glad youre here.
__label__joy Oh, youre such a gentleman.  Come on! Were going to my place!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hey-hey.
__label__neutral So are guys doing okay?
__label__neutral Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
__label__neutral Do you have a minute?
__label__neutral Well yeah, sure, whats up?
__label__non-neutral I got asked out twice today when I was at lunchby guys.
__label__surprise Oh really?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
__label__non-neutral Oh, did you not want people to know that?
__label__non-neutral But Im not gay. And I especially wouldnt want you to think I was gay.
__label__neutral Whys that?
__label__neutral I dont think I should say.
__label__neutral Ohh, you can say. Come on, I dont want you to feel like you cant tell me things.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Kay.
__label__neutral Well
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Id love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
__label__neutral Yeah, shes gay.
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__joy Great! All right, so Ill call you later.
__label__joy Great!
__label__surprise Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
__label__neutral That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.
__label__surprise Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
__label__neutral No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
__label__surprise Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!
__label__surprise Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
__label__disgust Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
__label__non-neutral What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.
__label__non-neutral Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.
__label__neutral But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.
__label__surprise You got all that from the back of her head?
__label__neutral All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
__label__neutral Whos Elaine?
__label__non-neutral Can you people not see me?!
__label__neutral So, will you talk to him?
__label__neutral I dont know Rach.
__label__non-neutral Oh, come on! Ill give you ten free
__label__anger One!  No ten! You said ten! You cant take that back!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?
__label__neutral We need a porn break.
__label__neutral We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
__label__non-neutral Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?
__label__neutral Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
__label__joy Ooh, good, youre hear! Okay.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__non-neutral Well, what-what cha got there?
__label__joy Oh this, well Im glad you asked.
__label__disgust Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?
__label__non-neutral Ahh!
__label__neutral Now, I know what youre thinking
__label__non-neutral Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
__label__surprise Phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they?
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__neutral Are you sure?
__label__anger No!
__label__neutral Honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
__label__neutral No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
__label__neutral Whats the second part of your plan?
__label__neutral Yes thats right.
__label__surprise Why?
__label__neutral I tired attacking two women, did not work.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral No, I mean its okay, I mean, theyre-theyre my friends.
__label__non-neutral In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
__label__non-neutral Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
__label__surprise Oh, no!
__label__surprise No-no!
__label__surprise No, I tired!
__label__neutral But I couldnt.
__label__non-neutral Thats why Im here.
__label__neutral Maybe we could attack them together?
__label__neutral That-thats a no.
__label__non-neutral What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross!
__label__anger Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross!
__label__anger I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
__label__non-neutral All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
__label__non-neutral No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
__label__neutral No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
__label__joy I like that.
__label__neutral Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
__label__neutral Huh?
__label__neutral One swift kick and hell back off.
__label__neutral All right, bad ankle, got it!
__label__neutral And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesnt wear a cup.
__label__joy Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
__label__neutral And uh, Liam, Liams got bad knees. You hit him right and hell go down like a lamp.
__label__non-neutral But-but, Liams on my team.
__label__anger I dont care! You just get him!
__label__joy Im gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
__label__joy The Red Ross! Okay.
__label__neutral Oh!  Oh by the way?
__label__neutral Uh-hmm.
__label__neutral James Brolin?
__label__neutral Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered hes gay.
__label__neutral Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Hello?
__label__neutral Hello, is Ross there?
__label__neutral Uh no, hes not. Can I take a message?
__label__neutral Yes, this Russell, Rosss divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I havent heard from him, I assume hes decided to give the marriage a try.
__label__surprise Ross got married againNooooooo!!!!!!!!!
__label__non-neutral Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking!
__label__non-neutral Oh!  Shes growing inside you.
__label__surprise Whoa!!
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__surprise Wow that was a big one.
__label__non-neutral I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.
__label__non-neutral Oh hey you guys!
__label__neutral Sure, I can hang out til I have to meet ya.  What uhHow come youre not going?
__label__neutral I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
__label__neutral I thought you already have a job.
__label__neutral And people say you dont pay attention.
__label__neutral No, this is a much better job.
__label__neutral Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
__label__surprise Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
__label__neutral Thats what I do now.
__label__neutral Hey Joey, come taste this.
__label__neutral What is it?
__label__anger Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well  Im getting my revenge!
__label__surprise You cooked him?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again.
__label__joy Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow!
__label__joy "Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
__label__non-neutral The front page? You really do live in your own little world, dont ya?
__label__neutral So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
__label__disgust No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
__label__sadness Were never gonna find anybody.
__label__joy Well then let me do it!
__label__non-neutral Joe
__label__non-neutral No-no-no!
__label__neutral Look, Ive been thinking about it.
__label__neutral Im an actor right?
__label__neutral So I wont get nervous talking in front of people.
__label__non-neutral Joey look its really sweet
__label__non-neutral No-no-no-no look no!
__label__non-neutral I wont spit, and I wont stare at Monicas breasts!
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__joy Everyone knows Im an ass man!
__label__neutral That is true.
__label__joy Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.
__label__joy Itll be me!
__label__joy And I swear Ill do a really good job.
__label__joy Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
__label__neutral Yknow, we havent found anybody else.
__label__joy It might be kinda cool.
__label__joy So I can do it?
__label__joy Ah-ha! Too cocky!
__label__non-neutral I still cant believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
__label__neutral Of course I do! And Im gonna give it back to you as soon as theyre done with it at the key shining place.
__label__non-neutral What the hell is that?
__label__surprise Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
__label__neutral You said there was a gas leak in here.
__label__neutral Well why dont you use your key?
__label__neutral Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded.
__label__neutral If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions.
__label__anger Come on!
__label__non-neutral Hurry up.
__label__neutral Oh! We could have done that.
__label__neutral Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about.
__label__sadness Oh, Im so sorry.
__label__non-neutral Um, and maybe Im wrong!
__label__neutral I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more.
__label__surprise You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him?
__label__neutral Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat.
__label__neutral (walking up with this
__label__non-neutral God Ross, what is that?
__label__non-neutral Oh, but its made her so happy.
__label__neutral Little girl misses her cat.
__label__non-neutral Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.
__label__neutral Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral I
__label__non-neutral He is right, isnt he?
__label__neutral Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong.
__label__surprise You think?
__label__neutral Oh-no, hes right.
__label__joy Seven hundred bucks!
__label__joy Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
__label__non-neutral Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
__label__neutral Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
__label__disgust What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
__label__neutral Me too.
__label__neutral Although this city is my home, so.
__label__neutral So thats dumb what I said, dont tell him I said that.
__label__neutral Umm, you make something up.
__label__joy Nice,  thank you.
__label__neutral This is me.
__label__neutral Here.
__label__non-neutral Your eyes are very pretty.
__label__joy Thank you, very much! Oh!  Thank you!
__label__neutral He would like to kiss you.
__label__neutral Okay, y'know what, you dont have to do that now.
__label__non-neutral No-no-no-no!!
__label__surprise Not him, you dont!
__label__neutral Well the moments over.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__non-neutral Oy!
__label__non-neutral Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
__label__neutral Id really prefer a mountain bike.
__label__neutral Janices birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
__label__surprise Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa.
__label__non-neutral Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
__label__disgust Thats a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. I would like to get her something serious.
__label__neutral Oh, you want something serious.
__label__neutral Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas.
__label__neutral Those are dead serious.
__label__non-neutral All right. Look, Im gonna go in here, and you dont buy me anything ever.
__label__fear No, no, you cant, you cant, okay, you cant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, you cant.
__label__surprise Why not?!
__label__neutral Oh God. Uh, okay, heres the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
__label__non-neutral What is the thing?
__label__non-neutral Okay. I went down to the Mattress King showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral They were in his office.
__label__sadness Well she, she wouldnt do that, shes with, shes with me.
__label__non-neutral All right!!
__label__non-neutral Im telling you its like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
__label__surprise Youre drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe Im a little drunk.
__label__joy Oh thats great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please?  There we go.
__label__non-neutral Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
__label__neutral How are you feeling?
__label__neutral You are
__label__non-neutral I really wish that you wouldnt.
__label__neutral Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?
__label__neutral Then we can put you in bed, okay?
__label__neutral Just smile and dont talk to
__label__joy Speech! Speech! Lets hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
__label__non-neutral Pheebs!!
__label__joy Dont you see? Everyones looking at me! The plans working! I didnt even have to take off my top yet!
__label__joy Speech! Come on Monica!
__label__joy Come on!
__label__joy Come on! Speech!
__label__non-neutral Hey Chandler, you cant keep your hands off her for one second!
__label__joy Oh-ho, I think its nice.
__label__neutral Well you have to because maybe its stupid.
__label__joy Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
__label__non-neutral Oh crap!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral The super couldnt figure out what it did.
__label__non-neutral A $200 an hour electrician couldnt figure out what it did.
__label__non-neutral Ive had seven pretty serious shocks.
__label__disgust I officially give up.
__label__joy Thank God.
__label__non-neutral I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
__label__non-neutral See? Im doing it. I am totally doing it.  I lost it.
__label__non-neutral Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
__label__neutral He doesn't have anyone.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
__label__disgust I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
__label__joy Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
__label__neutral Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
__label__neutral You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
__label__neutral Y'know, we don't have to watch this.
__label__non-neutral No way, forget it.
__label__non-neutral C'mon, she's your mom!
__label__neutral Exactly.
__label__joy Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books!
__label__joy I love her books!
__label__joy I cannot get on a plane without one!
__label__joy I mean, this is so cool!
__label__disgust Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
__label__joy C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral And a nice hot cider for Monica.
__label__neutral Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__surprise Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
__label__surprise Oh! That's why.  I'm sorry!
__label__neutral Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
__label__neutral Yes?
__label__non-neutral You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
__label__neutral Yeah I can, it worked real well.
__label__anger No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
__label__anger I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette.
__label__anger Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em.
__label__surprise Who are you talking too?
__label__disgust Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
__label__neutral I am
__label__anger You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.   Backup! Backup!!
__label__fear I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
__label__neutral Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
__label__fear Shh! Get me out of here.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__surprise Ross!
__label__neutral What?
__label__surprise Come here, check this out!
__label__neutral What? Is it the comet?
__label__surprise No! No-no. Look, theres a bug stuck in tar right here.
__label__non-neutral Joey comeI cant believeI bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of natures most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
__label__neutral Yknow, theres
__label__neutral Show me where?
__label__neutral Right-right up here.
__label__neutral Joey wheres the pipe that was holding the door open?
__label__non-neutral I dont know!   Yeah, I do.
__label__anger Joey!
__label__anger What?! All rightHey! Dont look at me! Youre the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid
__label__anger Its called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
__label__surprise Oh no! No! No!
__label__joy Wow! This place is incredible!  Stings penthat he gave to Phoebe.  Come on! Secret passageway!
__label__neutral Hi!
__label__neutral Hi!
__label__neutral Im Trudie.
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__neutral You must be Bens mum.
__label__neutral Why else would I be here?
__label__neutral Do sit down.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy Oh Rach thats great. Thats great.
__label__neutral Hi.. how was the game?
__label__neutral Well..
__label__joy WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
__label__surprise Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
__label__neutral Alan.
__label__joy He was unbelievable.
__label__joy He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
__label__joy I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
__label__joy Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
__label__neutral Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral ..I dunno, a little too Alan?
__label__non-neutral Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
__label__joy I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
__label__joy Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, thats the first A Ive gotten since seventh grade,
__label__non-neutral Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
__label__surprise What the hell!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral All right, lets start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
__label__disgust Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
__label__surprise My God!
__label__surprise These pants are burning up!
__label__surprise Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!
__label__non-neutral What is she trying to kill me?
__label__surprise It's like a volcano in here!
__label__neutral Are you hot?
__label__neutral Okay, it must just be me then.
__label__neutral That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
__label__anger You're driving me crazy with that!
__label__neutral Okay, I'll stop.
__label__non-neutral Dont stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
__label__non-neutral Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
__label__neutral You wanna play?
__label__neutral Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon.
__label__neutral And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
__label__neutral Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
__label__joy All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
__label__non-neutral I'm intrigued.
__label__neutral All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
__label__non-neutral Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
__label__neutral Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
__label__neutral Uh yeah, right here.
__label__joy Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
__label__neutral What's that?
__label__neutral Weeeell, it's rum, and-
__label__neutral I'm sure they'll be here soon.
__label__neutral Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
__label__neutral Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
__label__fear You are really frightening me.
__label__fear Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?
__label__neutral All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
__label__neutral All right, honey, time to start pushing.
__label__fear But they're not here yet!
__label__neutral I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
__label__fear Oh, god.
__label__non-neutral Here we go. Mona umm, I think its time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
__label__neutral Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
__label__non-neutral Aw, we-we are so So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, yknow hanging out with you.
__label__joy And I mean-Im having a lot of fun.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if its just fun.
__label__non-neutral Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right?
__label__neutral So where-where is it going?
__label__surprise Ah!
__label__neutral Thats-thats the real question.
__label__joy And-and the answer isis its going somewherefun.
__label__neutral Now I-I know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger.
__label__fear No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou
__label__non-neutral Im sorry, so umm, so where are we?
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__joy I am going to take you out to dinner tonight.
__label__joy I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .
__label__non-neutral No?
__label__surprise Really?
__label__joy They taste so good.
__label__neutral Drum roll.
__label__neutral Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
__label__neutral Nah, youre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
__label__neutral All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
__label__surprise Youre actually going through with this?
__label__non-neutral Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.
__label__neutral Okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
__label__non-neutral You got problems because of you!
__label__non-neutral Not your name!
__label__anger All right, this has got to stop!
__label__anger Chandler is a great name!
__label__non-neutral In factyes,  Im, Im sorry.
__label__neutral I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, Im-Im, Im gonna, Im gonna name the baby Chandler.
__label__surprise Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
__label__neutral It was.
__label__sadness Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, thats not gonna be me, not me.
__label__surprise Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
__label__neutral No.
__label__surprise Whoa. That was really good.
__label__neutral Thanks, any suggestions?
__label__non-neutral Hi!
__label__surprise You-youyou had sex with Ursula?!
__label__fear Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and
__label__surprise You didnt notice she was wearing different clothes?!
__label__non-neutral Well I was just so excited to see you.
__label__disgust Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird.
__label__non-neutral No-no its not!
__label__fear I dont want to lose you!
__label__non-neutral Its-its like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was youYeah it is too weird.
__label__non-neutral So I guess this is it.
__label__non-neutral Yeah.  Maybe its for the best. You smell just like her.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, so do you.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
__label__sadness Manhattan does not have enough stores.
__label__neutral Well,
__label__surprise You can?
__label__neutral Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
__label__neutral Um-hmm.
__label__neutral And a small piece of chocolate.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__sadness Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship
__label__non-neutral I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
__label__non-neutral Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
__label__non-neutral Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
__label__non-neutral I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
__label__surprise Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?
__label__neutral No! No! Not, Paris.
__label__joy Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
__label__non-neutral Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. Thats right, yes, Im being transferred to Yemen!
__label__non-neutral When?
__label__neutral I dont know exactly.
__label__sadness Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
__label__non-neutral But I do know that its some time tomorrow.
__label__joy Ooh, this is it!  Oh, thats him! Thats him!
__label__joy Great! Go get him.
__label__neutral Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
__label__neutral Hes not really my type.
__label__neutral No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see whats he like. People tell doctors everything.
__label__surprise But you said he was this great guy!
__label__sadness But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
__label__sadness You do attract some stinkers.
__label__neutral Chandler.
__label__neutral Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a
__label__neutral Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
__label__neutral Oh, listen.
__label__neutral If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them.
__label__non-neutral Really.
__label__neutral Nothing at all.
__label__non-neutral Really.
__label__neutral Nothing.
__label__neutral Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
__label__non-neutral Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one?
__label__non-neutral No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.
__label__neutral Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out?
__label__non-neutral No, no, I keep trying, yknow?
__label__sadness I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "go to the bathroom."
__label__neutral He may think Im sick.
__label__neutral Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with!
__label__neutral Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral Thats it.
__label__non-neutral Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna order me around all the time?
__label__neutral Pretty much.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__joy Hey Monica!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Hey man, you feeling any better?
__label__neutral Joey, we have something to tell you.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Youre pregnant!
__label__neutral Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, youre only married in Vegas.
__label__neutral What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youre married everywhere.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Yeah!
__label__surprise Oh my God!Eh! Well
__label__disgust You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave hes going straight to the porn.
__label__neutral Hes gonna go up to the counter with
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral I missed this.
__label__non-neutral Me too.
__label__neutral So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
__label__joy Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
__label__anger Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
__label__neutral We will.
__label__neutral Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
__label__neutral No Mon,
__label__neutral Every year.
__label__neutral And
__label__joy Hey! Ross!
__label__neutral Die Hard
__label__neutral Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
__label__neutral Whatd you rent?
__label__neutral Die Hard 2
__label__neutral Joey, this is
__label__neutral Oh, well we watch it a second time and its
__label__neutral Joey, we
__label__neutral And?
__label__joy And itll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
__label__neutral Die Hard
__label__neutral Dude, you didnt say
__label__neutral Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
__label__non-neutral Well, John McClane had plans!
__label__neutral No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
__label__non-neutral What are you talking about? Bitch.
__label__non-neutral I know you botched that operation on purpose.
__label__anger I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder.
__label__disgust I don't care if you    are my brother.
__label__joy Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch!
__label__anger Stop going through my stuff !
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__non-neutral I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
__label__fear No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
__label__non-neutral Please, what about you and Chandler?
__label__non-neutral That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
__label__non-neutral Well hello !
__label__non-neutral What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?
__label__anger I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
__label__non-neutral Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
__label__non-neutral I'm gonna do it.
__label__neutral And I can't stop you.
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
__label__neutral I'm smarter than
__label__non-neutral Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
__label__joy Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
__label__neutral Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im heading up there.
__label__neutral Uh, yeah, Ill take a coffee. Thanks, man.
__label__non-neutral Sure.  Coffee? Cause Im going up there.
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral No, thank you.
__label__neutral You guys need anything, cause Im heading up there.
__label__neutral Id love an ice water.
__label__neutral You got it.
__label__surprise Joey, what are you doing?
__label__non-neutral Just being friendly.
__label__non-neutral Joey, honey, I dont think youre supposed to go back there.
__label__neutral Nah, its okay. Right, Gunther?
__label__non-neutral Dont wink at me. And put on your apron.
__label__non-neutral Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
__label__surprise Joey, do you work here?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Hey, waiter.
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening.  Yeah we are.
__label__neutral Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.
__label__neutral Im calling for Monica Geller.
__label__neutral I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
__label__surprise This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!!
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__non-neutral I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
__label__neutral Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am
__label__non-neutral This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
__label__neutral So go fix it!
__label__neutral Go find Chandler!
__label__non-neutral He's probably up in your room!
__label__non-neutral Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
__label__joy Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
__label__joy Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
__label__neutral Anybody lose this?
__label__joy Comin' out. Place your bet.  Dice are out.  Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
__label__neutral Hmm.
__label__neutral Do you remember where the duck food is?
__label__surprise Yeah, its in the guys apartment under the sink. Why?
__label__neutral Because Im going to London.
__label__surprise What?! What do you mean youre going to London?
__label__neutral Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.
__label__neutral Now honey, you take care, you dont have those babies until I get back.
__label__non-neutral IRachel, you cant go! Ross loves Emily!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does.
__label__non-neutral But I have to tell him how I feel!
__label__neutral He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
__label__non-neutral Thats not why youre going!
__label__non-neutral Youre going because you hope hes gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach.
__label__non-neutral Forget that British chippy."
__label__surprise OhhDo you think he will?!
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__non-neutral Because hes in love with the British chippy!
__label__non-neutral Look, Rachel, if you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!
__label__anger Yknow, its too late!
__label__sadness You missed youre chance!
__label__sadness Im sorry, I know this must be really hard, its over.
__label__non-neutral Yknow what? No. Its not over until someone says, "I do."
__label__non-neutral I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. Im carrying a litter.
__label__neutral So is everybody here?
__label__neutral I got here a little early myself.
__label__neutral Let us begin.
__label__neutral Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.
__label__neutral Here.
__label__neutral Here.
__label__neutral Now as for the hydrosaurs
__label__neutral Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night.
__label__sadness Ive ah, Ive recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry.
__label__sadness So, do you think you can forgive me?
__label__joy Great.
__label__joy Thanks.
__label__neutral Okay, bye.
__label__neutral Hello, Jennifer?
__label__surprise Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there?
__label__surprise Oh, shes not home huh?
__label__neutral Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Are you all right?
__label__fear Uhh… I think I just got engaged.
__label__surprise Oh my God! He did it?
__label__non-neutral Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?
__label__surprise Are you kidding?
__label__non-neutral I'm like the one who talked him into it.
__label__non-neutral I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
__label__non-neutral And you really think this is a good idea?
__label__neutral I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people.
__label__non-neutral I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.
__label__surprise Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so.
__label__surprise Really?! Even Ross?
__label__joy Especially Ross!
__label__neutral Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come  back later.
__label__surprise Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just…I'll  come back.
__label__joy There he goes, your fiancée.
__label__neutral I guess so.
__label__neutral Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
__label__neutral I can't say that I'm surprised.
__label__sadness Oh, that is so unfortunate.
__label__neutral What?
__label__non-neutral Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
__label__neutral Okay, Ill be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe Im sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
__label__neutral You didnt leave lipstick marks on the phone.
__label__neutral Oh, then it mustve been you. Bye.
__label__non-neutral Bye-bye!  Thats why I moved out.
__label__neutral Hey, y'know while were on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you dont live here anymore.
__label__neutral I think on some levels she already knows.
__label__neutral Night Mon. Night Julio.
__label__neutral Adios.
__label__surprise Look Julio, someone left their book here.
__label__neutral Ah actually, that is mine.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, what are you reading?
__label__neutral Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
__label__neutral Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?
__label__neutral I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
__label__neutral Your a poet and don't know it.
__label__neutral Actually I ah, I am a poet.
__label__neutral Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?
__label__neutral Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
__label__neutral Mine?  Right here?
__label__joy I can write an epic poem about this lip.
__label__joy How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
__label__neutral Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral Were at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
__label__surprise Are we really in Montreal?!
__label__neutral Yes we are. So, coffee?
__label__non-neutral Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
__label__neutral Oh, no. But its just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
__label__neutral Okay, heres batch 22.
__label__non-neutral Oh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers.
__label__neutral This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
__label__neutral Lets give it a shot.
__label__neutral Okay. Man, I have
__label__surprise Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
__label__neutral No, just a Friday night.
__label__neutral Would she?
__label__anger Would she?  You ate my candy bar!
__label__disgust Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
__label__sadness I know honey, Im sorry.
__label__sadness Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in.
__label__non-neutral Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
__label__sadness Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt....
__label__disgust I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
__label__anger Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
__label__fear Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
__label__anger Its not funny, this is actually my job.
__label__neutral Oh believe me, I-I-Ive been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
__label__non-neutral Oh well then, so Im just going to go back to talking to my friend here.
__label__non-neutral And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
__label__neutral Ah, just one other thing.
__label__non-neutral Yes?!
__label__neutral I ah, I work at
__label__neutral Do you want my pickle?
__label__neutral Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
__label__surprise Why?
__label__neutral Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral Phoebe.
__label__non-neutral Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
__label__joy Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.
__label__non-neutral He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
__label__joy We should do something. Whistle.
__label__non-neutral We are not going to whistle.
__label__neutral Come on, do it.
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__joy Do it!
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__joy Do it do it do it!
__label__joy Woo-woo!
__label__surprise I can't believe you did that!
__label__neutral Hi! Umm, Im Monica Geller, Im the chef at Alessandros.
__label__surprise Still?
__label__non-neutral I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
__label__non-neutral I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
__label__anger Either eat it, or be in it.
__label__non-neutral Spoon?  So, what do you think?
__label__disgust Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.
__label__non-neutral Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; theres a new class comin in.
__label__neutral Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
__label__neutral I can.
__label__neutral Okay, go ahead.
__label__neutral Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
__label__neutral Thats very good, whats your name?
__label__neutral Monica.
__label__neutral Monica, you go to the head of the class.
__label__joy Okay.
__label__neutral And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,    it's a place I've never seeeeen.
__label__neutral But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen.
__label__neutral Humaaan spleeeeen.
__label__joy Olè!
__label__surprise What are you doing here!
__label__joy Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain!
__label__joy Great!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy It really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
__label__non-neutral Listen Phoebe...
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but...
__label__neutral But what?
__label__neutral This is kind of a classy place.
__label__neutral Ok, say no more.
__label__non-neutral I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
__label__neutral Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
__label__non-neutral Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
__label__non-neutral Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
__label__neutral I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention
__label__neutral Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
__label__non-neutral We can't. We're not pharmacists!
__label__neutral I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba...
__label__neutral Kate Miller?
__label__neutral Kate Miller it is.
__label__non-neutral And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
__label__neutral In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__sadness We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
__label__non-neutral This year was supposed to be great!
__label__disgust But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
__label__sadness No. No, you're not a loser.
__label__non-neutral Look at me!
__label__joy Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
__label__non-neutral Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
__label__joy See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy That really is something; that's really cool.
__label__joy Howdy partner!
__label__joy Maybe I should get another pair!
__label__joy Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.
__label__joy I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.
__label__non-neutral I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
__label__joy I would make a good cowboy.
__label__neutral Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.
__label__non-neutral No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
__label__surprise Oh yeah!
__label__neutral Great nap.
__label__neutral It really was.
__label__non-neutral Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.
__label__neutral So, lets talk about women. Im sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.
__label__neutral Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin?"
__label__disgust Oh, please!
__label__neutral Hey, how you doin?
__label__neutral Hey Mikey
__label__neutral Hey P
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral Setting rat traps.
__label__surprise To kill Bob??
__label__neutral No, no, to test his neck strength.
__label__non-neutral No, Mike, I don't want to kill him!
__label__non-neutral I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
__label__neutral Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
__label__neutral I'll find Bob, I'll get him.
__label__fear Bob?
__label__non-neutral Bob!
__label__non-neutral Robert!
__label__non-neutral Oh wait, I think I hear him.
__label__surprise Oh - Oh my god!
__label__surprise Bob    had babies!
__label__surprise Bob's a mom!
__label__non-neutral Better think of a new name for him.
__label__neutral I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
__label__neutral I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ...
__label__non-neutral Oh my god, we killed Bob!
__label__neutral Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
__label__neutral Suzie?
__label__joy Hmmm, soup!
__label__neutral Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
__label__neutral Oh yeah, no problem.
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__sadness Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection.
__label__surprise Joey!
__label__surprise What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
__label__anger Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!
__label__anger So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.
__label__anger I said, "No!"
__label__neutral Which puts
__label__non-neutral Great. So the ball is in his court?
__label__non-neutral Ball? There is no ball.
__label__surprise Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
__label__neutral Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
__label__surprise What?! Why?!
__label__neutral Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and
__label__non-neutral Oh great! That
__label__neutral Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's
__label__neutral Do-do you, do you have brothers?
__label__neutral No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
__label__neutral Are you close with them?
__label__neutral No-no, they're not very nice people.
__label__neutral Okay, listen, I really like you.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral I think this can go somewhere.
__label__neutral So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
__label__neutral Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of
__label__neutral Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
__label__non-neutral Its over.
__label__non-neutral Oh, was it awful?
__label__non-neutral Well, it was loong.
__label__neutral I didnt even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 oclock shadow on her head.
__label__sadness Anyway, she didnt want to stay.
__label__neutral I called a cab; she just left.
__label__neutral I wrote you a letter.
__label__joy Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
__label__neutral Its just some things Ive been thinking about.
__label__neutral Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
__label__neutral Okay.  Wow, its-its 5:30 in the morning.  So, Id better get cracking on this baby.
__label__neutral Well, Ill be waiting for you, just come up when youre done.
__label__non-neutral Okay, Ill be up in,  18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
__label__non-neutral The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
__label__neutral Well, you said that we except the
__label__neutral All right, that Ill retract.
__label__disgust But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasnt it.
__label__disgust Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice!
__label__disgust You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
__label__anger Hey! Im proud of that sauce, its delicious.
__label__surprise Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
__label__neutral Lebanon.
__label__non-neutral Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
__label__neutral How long is this gonna take? Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
__label__neutral Okay, then what happened?
__label__non-neutral Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn!
__label__neutral Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
__label__anger Nothing!   This is not over!
__label__anger No! No! No!
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in  Actually, thanks!
__label__neutral All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
__label__sadness Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__sadness Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
__label__neutral Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
__label__neutral That's okay, Joe.
__label__neutral All right, let's go Pheebs.
__label__surprise Oh God!
__label__joy That was amazing.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__joy Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?
__label__joy We may have just started a family.
__label__joy Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
__label__neutral And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
__label__non-neutral Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You cant just stare through the peep hole for three hours! Youre gonna get peep eye!
__label__surprise I knew it!
__label__non-neutral I knew it!
__label__non-neutral I always knew she liked him!
__label__non-neutral Y'know, shed say no, but here we are!
__label__neutral Right?
__label__non-neutral We just broke up, first thing she does!
__label__neutral You didnt just break up.
__label__anger Hey, its been like three weeks!
__label__disgust You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
__label__neutral Thats Bill Clinton.
__label__neutral Whos he huggin?
__label__surprise Oh my God! Thats Pete! But why is Bill huggin Pete?
__label__non-neutral This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
__label__joy We use it!!
__label__joy There you go!!
__label__surprise Oh my God, Monicas gonna go out with a millionaire.
__label__neutral Im not gonna go out with him.
__label__surprise Oh my God, I cant believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
__label__non-neutral Or incredibly offensive.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, sure, that too.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah!
__label__non-neutral Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily.
__label__neutral Well, there's this one thing Okay,  here goes.
__label__surprise I made a promise that--Oh hey!
__label__neutral What?
__label__surprise You're nose is bleeding!
__label__non-neutral Oh God.
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__anger Oh not again!
__label__sadness This-this happened when my grandfather died.
__label__disgust It's ugh!
__label__sadness Sorry.
__label__neutral Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
__label__neutral Umm
__label__sadness Sorry. Sorry.
__label__sadness Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
__label__non-neutral Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
__label__neutral Hello, Chip.
__label__non-neutral Hey, Rach! How ya doin?
__label__joy Im great! Im great. Ive got a great job at
__label__neutral So ah, Monica ready yet?
__label__neutral Shell be out in a second. So, Chip, hows umm, Amy Welch?
__label__surprise Amy Welch? Wow! I havent seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
__label__joy Thats right, I love you! And-and Im gonna play with you all the time.
__label__surprise How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
__label__neutral Hes talking to the baby.
__label__surprise Ohh!
__label__surprise Okay!
__label__surprise Okay, cause when-when he said, "I cant wait to hear your first words," I thought, "Theres a trick."
__label__neutral Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. Ill see you later.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__surprise Oh my, oh my God!
__label__surprise Aw, its unbelievable!
__label__surprise Wow!
__label__surprise She is kicking so much!
__label__joy Oh, shes like ummohwhos that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
__label__neutral Mia Hamm?
__label__non-neutral Mia Hamm!
__label__non-neutral Oh thats amazing.
__label__surprise Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
__label__surprise Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
__label__neutral Okay, what do you guys think?
__label__surprise Dude!
__label__non-neutral I have never known love like this.
__label__surprise You really like it?
__label__surprise Dude! How-how did you write this?
__label__neutral I stole Monicas and changed the name.
__label__neutral You cant
__label__joy If he goes first he can!
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__non-neutral Yeah!
__label__neutral Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, yknow?
__label__neutral Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
__label__joy Oh wow thats a great idea! And
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__non-neutral Oh.
__label__joy Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one.
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__neutral Yknow I gotta tell ya, sometimes I justI dont get Chandler.
__label__neutral Yknow, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you dont get all upset.
__label__non-neutral All the time?
__label__non-neutral All the time!
__label__neutral Cassie, how you-how you doin on thathot dog.
__label__neutral Im all done.
__label__joy Thank God.
__label__neutral I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
__label__neutral Oh right.
__label__neutral Right.
__label__joy Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you til you cried?
__label__sadness Were probably too old to do that now.
__label__joy Ill always remember that summer, because its when I got all of these freckles.
__label__joy Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and Ill always remember that summer because thats when I realized that we are related.
__label__surprise It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
__label__neutral Well Im, Im a little slow.  Just as our children would be.
__label__neutral Relax every muscle in your body.
__label__neutral Listen to the plinky-plunky music.
__label__neutral Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place.
__label__neutral Okay, tell me your happy place.
__label__joy Richard's living room, drinking wine.
__label__anger All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
__label__non-neutral I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
__label__neutral Well, okay, fine, use my happy place.
__label__neutral Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
__label__neutral All right, I'll try not to.
__label__neutral Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
__label__sadness Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
__label__joy All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
__label__sadness I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
__label__neutral All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__joy Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains.
__label__neutral And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
__label__disgust Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
__label__neutral OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
__label__neutral See you later Rach.
__label__neutral Bye-bye Julie.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
__label__neutral Hey?
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral Can I ask you somethin'?
__label__non-neutral Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__neutral Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
__label__neutral What's up?
__label__neutral F.Y.I..
__label__neutral I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons.
__label__neutral Her name is Stephanie... something.
__label__neutral She's supposed to be very good.
__label__surprise But what about Phoebe?
__label__disgust Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
__label__sadness Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
__label__neutral Uh...
__label__non-neutral Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
__label__non-neutral Ahh, no.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__surprise Are you jealous?
__label__non-neutral Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all.
__label__non-neutral I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
__label__non-neutral You are totally jealous.
__label__non-neutral I'm not jealous.
__label__neutral All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers.
__label__neutral And y'know, and um, I...
__label__neutral Honey, I love you too.
__label__non-neutral Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise Huh.
__label__non-neutral Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
__label__neutral Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
__label__surprise I cant believe you came back.
__label__non-neutral Dont say anything.
__label__neutral I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna think.
__label__joy I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
__label__joy Rachel! Rachel!
__label__neutral What?
__label__surprise You missed the exit!
__label__neutral Oh, sorry.
__label__surprise My God, what were you thinking about?
__label__neutral Um,  Barry.
__label__non-neutral Awwww!!
__label__surprise I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
__label__non-neutral Dude!
__label__joy And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.
__label__surprise God!
__label__non-neutral All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
__label__neutral Well actually, Ross doesn't.
__label__neutral Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
__label__neutral Dear Mary-Angela.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hows it going.
__label__non-neutral This is the hardest letter Ive ever had to write.
__label__disgust What the hells a matter with you?
__label__non-neutral How do you think Joeys going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
__label__neutral Well, thats the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually Ill be in Cuba.
__label__neutral All right, look, look, youve got to do this yourself, okay in person.
__label__neutral At least you know her name.
__label__neutral You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
__label__non-neutral What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
__label__non-neutral Where in Cuba?
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
__label__surprise Oh! I knew it! What happened?
__label__non-neutral Umm, she kissed me.
__label__surprise What?! You kissed!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?
__label__neutral A two and a five.
__label__joy Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Oh yeah! Okay, lets play again.  What do you got?
__label__neutral A four and a nine.
__label__surprise Youre kidding right?
__label__neutral No. Why?
__label__surprise Well thats a full cup!
__label__joy Damn! I am good at Cups!
__label__surprise What? Why? Where are you?
__label__neutral Im still on the set!
__label__non-neutral Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
__label__non-neutral I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go until we get this.
__label__non-neutral Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister.
__label__non-neutral No! No, Im the minister! Alright, look-look, put em both on the phone, Ill marry them right now.
__label__non-neutral Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
__label__anger Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I have the power!
__label__non-neutral Oh hey Joey! What's up?
__label__neutral I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
__label__neutral Yeah, I've been around.
__label__neutral Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
__label__neutral Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.
__label__surprise Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees!
__label__neutral Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.
__label__joy Great! Problem solved!
__label__non-neutral Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
__label__neutral All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
__label__surprise Why?
__label__non-neutral Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
__label__anger Bastard!
__label__surprise You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping orOh!
__label__surprise All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
__label__non-neutral Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__surprise Oh, I can't believe it!
__label__joy I mean I think it's great!
__label__neutral For him.
__label__neutral She might be able to do better.
__label__neutral Hey guys!
__label__neutral Joey! Come here! Come here!
__label__surprise What? What?
__label__neutral Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
__label__neutral You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
__label__neutral No. Joey, she
__label__surprise Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
__label__neutral Yes, but y'know what?
__label__neutral It doesn't matter who knows what.
__label__neutral Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!
__label__joy Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
__label__neutral It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
__label__neutral Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta change things.
__label__surprise You really think it would be that different?
__label__surprise How could it not be?
__label__sadness I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
__label__sadness And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a
__label__neutral Well, things change.
__label__sadness I dont want them to move to a
__label__neutral Itll be okay Joe.
__label__surprise Its still there!
__label__neutral Mrs. Braverman must be out.
__label__non-neutral She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.
__label__fear By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
__label__fear No that could kill her.
__label__neutral Well, we dont want that.
__label__neutral No, so were protecting her.
__label__neutral But we should take it.
__label__non-neutral But we should move quick.
__label__surprise Why?
__label__non-neutral Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
__label__fear Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
__label__neutral Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
__label__neutral Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
__label__neutral Well, you're gonna.
__label__neutral I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
__label__neutral Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
__label__neutral Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.
__label__non-neutral And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?
__label__neutral Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
__label__neutral Hey, you're not him.
__label__neutral You're you.
__label__neutral When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.
__label__non-neutral Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!
__label__neutral And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
__label__non-neutral You really think so?
__label__neutral Yeah. I really do.
__label__neutral Thanks, Chandler.
__label__non-neutral Get off!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
__label__neutral When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
__label__neutral And the cream?
__label__neutral Cheese makes me thirsty.
__label__neutral Okay. Lets move on.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__surprise Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! Youve never made this before?
__label__surprise Oh no!
__label__neutral I dont know anything about cooking.
__label__neutral I had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
__label__joy Well, hats off to the chef.
__label__neutral I-I-Im sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didnt hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
__label__joy The chef!
__label__joy Thats right.
__label__neutral Hey, Pheebs.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral How's it going?
__label__non-neutral Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
__label__neutral So what's going on?
__label__neutral Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
__label__neutral I dunno, there's just something about...
__label__neutral Basically we just feel that he's...
__label__disgust We hate that guy.
__label__disgust Yeah. Hate him.
__label__sadness We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
__label__disgust ...No, we hate him.
__label__sadness We're sorry.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
__label__non-neutral Yes that was mine.
__label__non-neutral 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
__label__non-neutral Yes that would have made more sense.
__label__anger Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!
__label__neutral All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time.
__label__neutral And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.
__label__non-neutral Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?
__label__surprise !
__label__non-neutral Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
__label__non-neutral Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
__label__surprise She said what?
__label__neutral She said, "If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
__label__non-neutral Postpone it?
__label__non-neutral Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?
__label__non-neutral Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?
__label__neutral This isnt right.
__label__non-neutral I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure theyll come back when we can do it right.
__label__non-neutral I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
__label__anger Dont you point your pants at me!
__label__anger We have no choice!
__label__non-neutral Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross dont you understand?
__label__non-neutral This is our wedding Im talking about.
__label__neutral The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when were getting married.
__label__non-neutral So what are you saying? Its now or never?
__label__neutral No. Im saying its now.
__label__non-neutral Or?
__label__non-neutral Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
__label__non-neutral Its not the pants.
__label__non-neutral Its you that is backwards.
__label__anger And if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all!
__label__sadness No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please
__label__neutral Hi, honey.
__label__neutral See you later.
__label__non-neutral What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
__label__anger Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
__label__neutral Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller.
__label__surprise Oh no!
__label__neutral I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
__label__non-neutral Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!!
__label__surprise This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
__label__anger NOOOO!!!!!!!!
__label__surprise Ma! What're you doing here?
__label__neutral I came to give you this  and this.
__label__surprise Oww! Big ring!
__label__neutral Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
__label__non-neutral Do you uh, do you talk about me?
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah, all the time.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
__label__disgust Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
__label__disgust Have you ever seen so much crap?
__label__non-neutral Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
__label__neutral Check this out. Can I have this?
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.
__label__neutral All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.
__label__non-neutral It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
__label__sadness If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
__label__joy Fortunately, it is me.
__label__joy And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.
__label__joy Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate.
__label__neutral Y'know, someplace nice.
__label__neutral Yeah, someplace nice.
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__non-neutral How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
__label__neutral So, what do you think?
__label__joy I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
__label__joy I know!
__label__neutral So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
__label__joy Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
__label__joy Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!
__label__surprise Whats this?
__label__neutral Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
__label__neutral Gotcha.
__label__neutral This place is really my Grandmothers.
__label__neutral I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.
__label__neutral So if the landlord ever asks, Im 87 year old woman, whos afraid of her VCR.
__label__neutral So are you thirsty?
__label__non-neutral Oh, you bet I am!
__label__non-neutral Okay, heres your penis!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral How was your first day?
__label__neutral Ohh, okay.
__label__joy Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
__label__neutral Thank you, its my moms. So this is the kitchen.
__label__neutral Hey, ready for dinner?
__label__joy Ooh, absolutely!
__label__joy Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
__label__neutral Ooh, I love that place!  So, no.
__label__neutral How about Mama Lisettie's?
__label__neutral Enh. Sure!
__label__disgust I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out.
__label__neutral Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!
__label__neutral Thatthis milk is mine.
__label__neutral I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.
__label__joy Okay, let's go!
__label__non-neutral Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the
__label__neutral But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
__label__disgust Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
__label__anger Okay, stop!
__label__neutral Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?
__label__non-neutral Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
__label__neutral Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
__label__non-neutral Thank you.
__label__non-neutral Okay, go!
__label__neutral Go!
__label__non-neutral Go!
__label__disgust Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
__label__non-neutral No! No! Phoebe, come on! I dont want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
__label__joy No but at Monicas you can eat cookies over the sink!
__label__sadness I know. Im sorry.
__label__neutral All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral God, what a mess.
__label__neutral Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
__label__sadness Well, I lost.
__label__sadness Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.
__label__non-neutral Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
__label__joy Hey! Howd the interview go?
__label__sadness Oh, I blew it. I wouldnt of even hired me.
__label__sadness Oh, come here sweetie, listen, youre gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.
__label__sadness Thats not how that was supposed to come out.
__label__sadness This is the worst Christmas ever.
__label__neutral Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
__label__anger I cant!
__label__anger Its too late!
__label__sadness Terry already hired that girl over there.
__label__sadness Look at her, shes even got waitress experience.
__label__sadness Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.
__label__neutral That word was swans.
__label__surprise What do we got there?
__label__surprise A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
__label__joy You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
__label__neutral It's all right.
__label__neutral It's all right.
__label__neutral You don't have to explain.
__label__neutral This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
__label__neutral You're our third call tonight.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
__label__sadness I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
__label__neutral No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
__label__joy Thank God. Food.
__label__neutral Phoebe?
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral Do you have a plan?
__label__non-neutral I don't even have a 'pl'.
__label__non-neutral No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
__label__surprise Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
__label__surprise Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
__label__non-neutral Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
__label__non-neutral And-and a power tie?
__label__surprise Oh God.
__label__surprise Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
__label__neutral Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
__label__neutral Big Bird's friend.
__label__joy I see pizza!
__label__joy Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
__label__non-neutral Hello? Who are we spying on?
__label__neutral Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
__label__neutral What?!
__label__joy I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
__label__disgust No, no!
__label__disgust What are you crazy?!
__label__non-neutral Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, its like a law!
__label__neutral Allll done!
__label__joy Aww, thank you.
__label__neutral Okay, whos next?!
__label__disgust No-o-o!  No way!
__label__neutral Come on, please?! Im boredddd! You let me do it once before.
__label__non-neutral Yeah well, if ah, if thats the rule this weekend...  No!
__label__surprise Its beautiful! Its like the first bathroom floor there ever was.  Whoa! Are you going in there for?
__label__neutral What, like a number?
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hi! Bye!
__label__neutral Okay, Im done with my choices, these are final.
__label__non-neutral Well, its about time.
__label__neutral Ooh, very official.
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
__label__neutral And who laminated it?
__label__neutral That would be me.
__label__neutral All right let me see.  Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
__label__non-neutral Hey, its my list.
__label__neutral Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
__label__neutral Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the

__label__non-neutral Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early
__label__non-neutral Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
__label__non-neutral Oh no, I'm fully qualified to
__label__anger Shh!
__label__anger Doogie, shh!
__label__surprise Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon?
__label__surprise Huh?

__label__joy Oh cool! You made him cry!
__label__neutral Hey, theres uh, some people outside, askin about candy.
__label__anger Well, theyre just gonna have to wait arent they? Ive only got two hands!!
__label__neutral Need some help?
__label__non-neutral No! You dont know the system! Therell be nobody messing with the system!
__label__neutral Your license please.
__label__neutral You dont-you dont want to hear about my dream OfficerPretty?
__label__neutral Its Petty.  Ill be right back with your ticket.
__label__surprise You have a son!
__label__neutral I know. I know.
__label__neutral Uh, like, could these margaritas
__label__neutral Hello, Mr. Bing.
__label__joy Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
__label__neutral Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk
__label__neutral Sure.
__label__neutral No problem.
__label__non-neutral You have to give 'em something, you know.
__label__neutral Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
__label__neutral Petrie.
__label__neutral Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working
__label__non-neutral ....right?
__label__non-neutral Right?
__label__non-neutral I mean its pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back.
__label__non-neutral Y'know I dont, I dont need them, huh, Ive got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
__label__joy Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
__label__surprise 717?  Wheres 717?  Hey, youve have more of these for Susan right?
__label__neutral No. But its okay, Ill just put out pickles or something.
__label__joy Ross, thank God.
__label__surprise Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
__label__disgust I ate a bug.
__label__non-neutral Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Lets stock up.
__label__fear Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we dont know where we are, so we cant get a tow truck.
__label__non-neutral Oh, now you want a favour?
__label__neutral Yes, please.
__label__anger Well, oh, Im sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but Im a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
__label__neutral Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
__label__non-neutral No, Im not gonna pick them up.
__label__neutral Listen, we both know youre gonna do it cause youre not a jerk.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__non-neutral So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
__label__non-neutral No, Rachel doesnt want me to....
__label__neutral Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but dont punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
__label__neutral Yeah, youre right.
__label__sadness God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
__label__sadness Oh, I know.
__label__sadness I kinda feel like it's my fault.
__label__anger Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
__label__anger Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
__label__non-neutral Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
__label__neutral All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
__label__non-neutral Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
__label__anger Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.
__label__non-neutral Okay, I admit it!
__label__joy I love this coat!
__label__joy Okay, Iit's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley!
__label__neutral Remember Phil Huntley?
__label__joy He was fine!
__label__joy So your dad dropped by. Hes a pleasant man!
__label__fear Oh no
__label__neutral Id better go. (She goes and sits down in the
__label__sadness Ross Im so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
__label__anger I dont care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now shes totally freaked out!
__label__neutral Oh okay, Ill fix that to. Whats her e-mail address?
__label__anger Rachel!
__label__non-neutral All right, I promise. Ill fix this. I swear. Ill-Ill-Ill-Ill talk to her.
__label__anger Okay!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Thank you!
__label__non-neutral Thats it?!
__label__surprise You call that a fight?
__label__non-neutral Come on!
__label__non-neutral "We were on a break!"
__label__non-neutral "No we werent!"
__label__surprise What happened to you two?
__label__surprise !
__label__neutral Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
__label__neutral I'm sorry.
__label__neutral But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it.
__label__neutral Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
__label__neutral Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
__label__surprise Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the
__label__neutral I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
__label__non-neutral Is this because of the burrito thing?
__label__neutral You need to give him money.
__label__surprise Give him money? It was a joke!
__label__non-neutral No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
__label__neutral Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
__label__neutral You've got to be smooth about it.
__label__neutral Hey, I can be smooth.
__label__neutral Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
__label__neutral Of course, sir.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Id better get back to my desk.
__label__joy Okay, you hard worker! Ill remember to put that in your evaluation.
__label__surprise My what?
__label__neutral Well, youve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation.
__label__neutral But yknow, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
__label__surprise Are you serious?
__label__neutral No, Ive just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
__label__neutral I can blow dry it.
__label__neutral I can put gel on it.
__label__neutral It doesnt matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head.
__label__disgust Its so annoying.
__label__non-neutral Does it bug you?
__label__disgust You bug me.
__label__neutral Is there any chance you didnt see that?
__label__neutral Hey Joey, what cha doing?
__label__neutral Sweepin. Why? Turn you on?
__label__non-neutral No.
__label__non-neutral Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
__label__neutral Joey, did
__label__non-neutral Where are you going? The vicar wont be home for hours.
__label__surprise Joey,  where did you learn that word?
__label__neutral Where do you think,  Zelda?
__label__non-neutral You found my book?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah I did!
__label__anger Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
__label__surprise Okay, look Im sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldnt have, but you got porn!
__label__anger Hey-hey, yknow what?
__label__anger I dont care!
__label__non-neutral Im not ashamed of my book.
__label__neutral Theres nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a littleerotica.
__label__non-neutral Its just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
__label__non-neutral You got porn!
__label__joy Well, I feel like a snack!
__label__neutral Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are.
__label__neutral Oh no thanks. I dont like
__label__surprise What?!
__label__sadness Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
__label__neutral Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__non-neutral No-no theyre not.
__label__anger Theyre still very angry!
__label__neutral But yknow Chandler is also half-Swedish.
__label__neutral You know what the Swedish people are famous for?
__label__non-neutral Sitting down and being quiet.
__label__neutral Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more
__label__anger You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
__label__surprise How did you know about that?!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Come in.
__label__neutral Thanks for comin back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and
__label__joy Great!
__label__neutral Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match.
__label__neutral Okay, so I made up a little test.
__label__neutral Now, Im gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
__label__neutral I can do that.
__label__neutral Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
__label__neutral Fight.
__label__joy Very good! Okay. G.
__label__neutral String?
__label__joy Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
__label__neutral Kitten?
__label__non-neutral Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, butbye-bye!
__label__disgust Dad, please dont pick your teeth out here!
__label__disgust Alright, and if youre gonna put your feet up, why dont you sit on the-
__label__non-neutral Monica, leave him alone
__label__non-neutral Will you hurry up?
__label__surprise Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janines friends are dancers?!
__label__non-neutral And that theyre going to be drinking alot!
__label__surprise ?
__label__neutral No, I did, but tell me again, because its so romantic.
__label__anger Well youre whippin so slow! Cant you do it any faster?
__label__anger Joey!
__label__anger Come on!
__label__non-neutral I dont wanna make any mistakes, alright?
__label__fear This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?
__label__neutral So why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
__label__joy Oh I am!
__label__anger Ross, if you dont tell them, then I will!
__label__non-neutral Okay, fine!
__label__neutral Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
__label__neutral Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it cant? Okay.
__label__joy You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
__label__joy Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
__label__joy Okay, now you're even cuter!!
__label__neutral Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
__label__surprise What are you talking about?
__label__joy I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
__label__non-neutral That's not possible!
__label__surprise Ow!
__label__non-neutral I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
__label__non-neutral Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
__label__sadness I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
__label__anger No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!

__label__neutral Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge.
__label__neutral Right?
__label__neutral And then you say to person, I bet you cant roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face.
__label__neutral And then when they do it, theyre left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
__label__neutral Can I do it to you?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I-I-I-Im funny Ben, but Im not stupid. Okay?

__label__neutral So the Porsche guy took his car back.
__label__neutral But you found the keys to his clothes?
__label__non-neutral No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.

__label__non-neutral Uh, hang out?! How long?
__label__neutral I don't know.
__label__non-neutral A week?
__label__neutral Maybe two?

__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral So how was Joan?
__label__neutral I broke up with her.
__label__surprise Dont tell me, because of the big nostril thing?
__label__disgust They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
__label__neutral Come on, they were not that huge.
__label__disgust I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain.
__label__surprise How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
__label__neutral Hold it, hold it.
__label__neutral I gotta side with Chandler on this one.
__label__disgust When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple.
__label__disgust It made me nuts.
__label__neutral You or me?
__label__non-neutral I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
__label__surprise You guys are messing with me, right?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
neutral	also I was the point person on my companys transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
neutral	You mustve had your hands full.
neutral	That I did. That I did.
neutral	So lets talk a little bit about your duties.
surprise	My duties?  All right.
neutral	Now youll be heading a whole division, so youll have a lot of duties.
neutral	I see.
neutral	But therell be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.
neutral	Good to know.
neutral	We can go into detail
fear	No dont I beg of you!
neutral	All right then, well have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, youll fit in well here.
surprise	Really?!
neutral	Absolutely.  You can relax; you did great.
surprise	But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
non-neutral	You know? Forget it!
surprise	No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
non-neutral	No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know
neutral	Ok!

sadness	Got me.
neutral	Can I get a beer.
neutral	Hey, did you pick a roommate?
joy	You betcha!
neutral	Is it the Italian guy?
non-neutral	Um-mm, yeah right!
surprise	Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
surprise	What, what, what?!
surprise	What?!
neutral	He was with her when he wrote this poem.
neutral	Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside.
neutral	Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'
surprise	He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
non-neutral	You really think that is what he meant?
sadness	Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
neutral	Done.
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	Hi!
surprise	What are you doing here?
neutral	Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
neutral	Oh.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Howd did it go?
joy	Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldnt shut up.
joy	Im so proud of you.
joy	Me too!
non-neutral	Listen, Im ah, Im sorry Ive been so crazy and jealous and, its just that I like you a lot, so...

non-neutral	Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
non-neutral	I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
neutral	Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
non-neutral	I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
anger	You fell asleep!!
anger	There was no kangaroo!
non-neutral	They didnt take any of my suggestions!
neutral	Thats for coming buddy.
neutral	Ill see you later.
sadness	Dont go!
sadness	Im sorry.
sadness	Im so sorry!
surprise	Look!
non-neutral	This guy fell asleep!
non-neutral	He fell asleep too!
anger	Be mad at him!
non-neutral	Or, call an ambulance.
neutral	Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
non-neutral	What?! What is with everybody? Its Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
neutral	Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring.
neutral	See, if Im not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity
neutral	Okay, thats enough honey!
neutral	I dont know.  Let me see the ring.
joy	Great! Okay, here.

neutral	I know.
neutral	I'm back.
neutral	So, are we gonna get together or what?
neutral	Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
neutral	Great, I'll see you then.
joy	Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
neutral	Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."
neutral	I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
disgust	Oh my god. You are pure evil.
non-neutral	Ok, pure evil , horny and alone . I've done this
anger	Nobody!
anger	Nobody respects the bucket!
non-neutral	You wouldn't believe what people put in here!

surprise	What?!
non-neutral	Whats wrong with you?
neutral	Nothing!
fear	Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.
neutral	But um, I dont think its anything serious.
surprise	This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor!
fear	No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
non-neutral	Thats a hernia.
anger	Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!
joy	I love your place! Where is this guy from?
neutral	Uh thats an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.

sadness	Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
non-neutral	I knew that was him!
sadness	Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
neutral	Hey, you ok?
sadness	I guess.
neutral	There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey.
neutral	I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else.
neutral	Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
neutral	Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.

joy	Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
non-neutral	Oy!!
surprise	Whats with all this sand?
neutral	Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
neutral	Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
anger	Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
joy	Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
neutral	If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?

neutral	Yeah, that really calms me down.
non-neutral	And!
joy	We have so much in common!

non-neutral	Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
surprise	Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
neutral	It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
surprise	What's going on with you?
anger	I got no sleep last night!
neutral	Why?
disgust	My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed.
neutral	Oh, and deaf.
neutral	So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time.
disgust	You have no idea how loud they are!
neutral	Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
joy	Thanks.
disgust	Ew! What is that? Something exploded!

neutral	Breathe, breathe, breathe.
surprise	Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually going to kill you dead.
non-neutral	Okay! You dont think I thought of that?
surprise	How can you not know which one?
non-neutral	I mean thats unbelievable.
neutral	I mean, was it Gina?
neutral	Which one is Gina?
neutral	Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
neutral	No, no, no, thats Dina.

neutral	: Right.  Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.
surprise	Really?
neutral	: Yeah, you could dance real good with her, shes the same size as me.
neutral	No, Im good.
non-neutral	Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
neutral	Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so
surprise	Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
neutral	Who knows?
neutral	Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
joy	Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!
joy	Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
joy	Yeah!
neutral	Actually, that can't happen.
neutral	Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
neutral	So it'll be either you two  or you two.
non-neutral	Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
neutral	Yeah, it is.
neutral	No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
non-neutral	Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
joy	Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
non-neutral	Please!
non-neutral	Are you kidding?
non-neutral	I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody noseI mean I-Im not proud of it but, I really am.
joy	And its all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
fear	I think youve got concussion.
joy	No, no, Im serious. Thank you.
fear	Youre welcome.  Im sorry. Did I hurt you?
non-neutral	Its worth the pain.  Yknow what, you know what? Its not.
surprise	Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
non-neutral	I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do"  "I do".
neutral	Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
joy	David is going to propose to Phoebe.
surprise	What?  Why?
non-neutral	Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
anger	Chandler, we have talked about this.
anger	You are not supposed to give people advice!
non-neutral	Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
neutral	I
anger	They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!
non-neutral	She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone
non-neutral	Man, that's some
neutral	Oh, that's not what you want...
neutral	This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
joy	It-its great to meet you Paul.
neutral	I usually prefer Elizabeths boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
neutral	Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
anger	So Ross, what your problem?
surprise	Eh-whExcuse me?
anger	Why cant you get a girlfriend your own age?

neutral	No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
neutral	Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
neutral	Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
surprise	What?! You totally get embarrassed!
neutral	No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.

joy	I did it!
joy	I rode a bike!

joy	Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
non-neutral	Good, good, life is good...
joy	Good!
non-neutral	Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
neutral	Oh, good for you.
non-neutral	She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that".
sadness	Mike and I broke up.
sadness	It means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us.
surprise	Oh my God!
sadness	I'm sorry.
sadness	I'm sorry too.
non-neutral	Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
non-neutral	I know.
neutral	Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.

non-neutral	You look at me, and its nothin.
non-neutral	Nothing.
joy	Tasty! Im really starting to feel like you guys have a history, its-its nice.
neutral	I have a question about this scene.
neutral	Yes?
non-neutral	Well, I dont understand why Adriennes attracted to Victor.
neutral	Peel the onion. First of all, hes good looking.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	I think my characters gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
neutral	Oh, hey, how about this one.
non-neutral	Ah, its says so in the script!
non-neutral	Y'know ah, I-I dont know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that youre a bitch.
anger	It doesnt say that in the script.
non-neutral	It does in mine!
non-neutral	I cant
non-neutral	Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
neutral	Yknow who has a great video camera?

neutral	Sure. So how long you been...
neutral	Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
surprise	Since then?!
neutral	No, it's only been six years.
neutral	I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy.
neutral	...Joe.
neutral	Y'ever been in love?
neutral	...I d'know.
neutral	Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
disgust	You're one to talk.
neutral	Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
non-neutral	Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
surprise	Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
neutral	Everythings gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
surprise	Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  Thats supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
neutral	Hey, Rach, how was work?
neutral	Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasnt a chair.
neutral	By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
neutral	Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming.
neutral	Im just gonna throw it out, its probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
neutral	Something wrong?
neutral	No. Nothing.
neutral	And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
surprise	Yeah, that's it?
neutral	Yeah.
joy	Yess!!
joy	We're teeth people Zack!
sadness	Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
non-neutral	No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name!

non-neutral	No they didnt!
neutral	You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
neutral	It's gonna be worth it.
neutral	It's a known fact that women love babies, all right?
neutral	Women love guys who love babies.
neutral	It's that whole sensitive thing.
neutral	Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there.
neutral	Maybe one of them will break away.
non-neutral	No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left.
neutral	All right, gimme the baby.

non-neutral	What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
neutral	Well, we are great guys.
neutral	Bye.
neutral	Well, not really.
neutral	I mean technically its-its not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.
non-neutral	Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
non-neutral	Well Ross, you be careful now. You dont want to get a reputation as yknow Professor McNailshisstudents.
non-neutral	Yeah. What-what should I do?
neutral	Well Ross, it seems pretty clear.
neutral	I mean whats more important?
neutral	What people think or how you feel, huh?
neutral	Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
joy	Joey that is so sweet.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?

non-neutral	Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance!
non-neutral	I mean, I love-I love this little guy!
surprise	Ah-ah!!

anger	God!
neutral	Hey, how you doin?
neutral	Hey.
non-neutral	Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
neutral	No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
non-neutral	I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
anger	For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
anger	You had no
anger	Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
anger	But I told you, I didnt have the time!
anger	Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
anger	Wh, Ross what do you want from me?
anger	You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
neutral	I know.
non-neutral	Ooh, I have to tell you something.
neutral	What?
neutral	But I cant tell you.
neutral	Okay, but wouldnt it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
neutral	Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldnt tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
neutral	Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
neutral	No.
neutral	Does it have to do with Joey?
neutral	No.
neutral	Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
neutral	No, but lets come back to that later!
joy	Hi!
joy	Richard!
neutral	Actually, Im not here to complement the chef.
neutral	Ohh Oh, thats okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef.
neutral	Like I have nothing better to do!
neutral	So whats up?
joy	Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
neutral	Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
joy	No! I came here to tell you something else.  I came here  to tell you I still love you.
non-neutral	One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
non-neutral	So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
anger	Maybe!  Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it! I cant!
fear	Joey, I am scared to death about this.
fear	But I really think I can do it, Im just gonna need some help.
neutral	And Bobbys gonna be here the whole time.
joy	You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, were straight-up gangster rap.
anger	Look, Rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her. Why cant you do that for me?
non-neutral	Because! Cause Cause youre my baby sister!
joy	And youre my big brother!
neutral	I mean, youre my favorite guy in the whole world.
neutral	Im not even scared to tell mom and dad.
fear	I was scared of telling you.
non-neutral	Well Id be scared of them, but all right.
sadness	Joey, I cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.
sadness	I want him to have his uncle.
sadness	Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
joy	Of course hes gonna have his Uncle Joey!
joy	Were gonna be all right. I mean, even if were not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
joy	Thats right! By his uncle too!
joy	And by you.
neutral	Okay Bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have a little moment.
non-neutral	Come here!
non-neutral	No! Seriously! Whats wrong with you?!
joy	I had a really nice time tonight.
joy	So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
neutral	I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
surprise	You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch?  Ohhh! I saw
neutral	Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.

non-neutral	Im not-Im not-Im not gay!
neutral	Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
neutral	Uh-huh.
non-neutral	That sounds great!
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You cant eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
surprise	Theres gravy?
neutral	If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time.
neutral	That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, thats your department now.
neutral	What are you doing?
neutral	I think I left a donut up here.
neutral	So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so Im happy.

non-neutral	Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?
joy	Yeah!
neutral	Oh then you know each other.
neutral	Were on a semi-first name basis.
neutral	What do you think of adding him to our team?
non-neutral	Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know if he has what it takes.
surprise	Really? They love him down on six.
neutral	But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here.
joy	Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
neutral	A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
joy	No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans tux!
surprise	What?
joy	Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat Batman film he was in.
anger	You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James Bonds tux!
neutral	So?
sadness	SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.
non-neutral	Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say "I do," hes thinking, "Yeah, Id do her too!"
neutral	Well then we still have a problem.
neutral	Yeah!
neutral	With what?
neutral	Well, were trying to find someone to perform our wedding and theyre all either boring or annoying or yknow, cant stop staring at the ladies.
joy	Oo! You should have one of us do it!
neutral	Phoebe, were getting

surprise	Are you serious?
joy	Yes! A friend of mine did it and its totally legal!
joy	I call it!!
anger	What?! No! It was my idea!
neutral	Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
anger	Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
neutral	We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
joy	See, I see.... big passion in your future.
surprise	Really?
neutral	I do.
joy	Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
non-neutral	It's never gonna happen.
non-neutral	Everybody knows!
neutral	That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why.
neutral	Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldnt sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
neutral	Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
neutral	Yeah, I wouldve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
surprise	What?!?!
neutral	Okay, this is what Im talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
neutral	You can spill. In the sink.
sadness	Aw, honey its not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I dont see that happening.
joy	I love you, too.
non-neutral	Aww, good.  What?
sadness	What? Im just said.
neutral	No youre not, youre wondering which cushion it is.
surprise	Oh my God! Are you serious?!
neutral	Uh-huh.
joy	I would love to live with you Ross; thats-thats great! Thank you!
neutral	Well, Im-Im just glad I could, yknow, help you out.
non-neutral	Wow! Im-Im so happy for you guys.  This is so-so, not stupid.
joy	Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me!
sadness	I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.
joy	You just saved me!
joy	Youre my hero!
neutral	Hero, I uh, I dont knowwell, all right.
joy	Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
non-neutral	Oh please!   Youre gonna say things now, arent ya?
neutral	No.
neutral	No, I wont.
neutral	But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise.
non-neutral	She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!
non-neutral	And thats how she ended up living with me!
neutral	Okay, thats a lie.
disgust	Ugh!!
neutral	What happened?
neutral	I ended up at Ross's place.
neutral	Oh, I musta missed counted or something.
anger	Damn!
non-neutral	She's not there anymore.
neutral	Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
neutral	No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
non-neutral	...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?
joy	Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
neutral	Lose the robe.
surprise	Me?
joy	That's great.
neutral	Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
neutral	No, no, I'm still working on mine.
surprise	That's it?
non-neutral	Yeah, it was really hard.
neutral	Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
non-neutral	Ok, you weren't there.
joy	Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice!
neutral	Pretty nice?
neutral	Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
neutral	We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weve got a canoe.
neutral	Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe.
non-neutral	You gotta take the canoe!
neutral	All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
anger	Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
non-neutral	Good for you!!
neutral	Pheebs?
neutral	Yeah?
neutral	Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
surprise	One ticket to Yemen?
neutral	Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
surprise	Im sorry sir, I dont understand.
neutral	What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
neutral	Are you travelling with a child?
neutral	No.
neutral	All right, yknow what, shes  gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card.
non-neutral	Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we dont take library cards.
non-neutral	Whats the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
neutral	Okay, but this is the last time.
joy	With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there.
joy	Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hows she doing?
surprise	She?
non-neutral	Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she?
neutral	I dont know.  I cant tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
neutral	Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
non-neutral	Excuse me?
neutral	What?
non-neutral	Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
neutral	Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
neutral	Well sensitive is important, pick him.
neutral	Yeah.
disgust	Oh sure, go with the sissy.
anger	Jason is not a sissy!
non-neutral	Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesnt matter.
neutral	I mean, I think it wouldve happened either way.
neutral	I mean if you hadnt initiated it I-I-I know I wouldve.
joy	It was an amazing night.
joy	It was. It was an amazing night.
non-neutral	You think it looked amazing?
neutral	Do we have a name yet?
neutral	No, not yet.
neutral	Thats fine, for now well just call her Baby Girl Green.
neutral	Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
joy	Hello baby girl.
non-neutral	Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
non-neutral	I dont like sitting up here! Im just gonna over
non-neutral	No Rachel! They got here first!
neutral	Why is Ross doing that?
fear	DANGER
surprise	Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
neutral	No thats all right. Dont worry about it.
disgust	Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain!
non-neutral	Rach! Hey! Its fine! Youre at Joeys!
surprise	Really?
neutral	Yeah! Look!
non-neutral	Ive never lived like this before.
neutral	I know.
neutral	All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food.
neutral	Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
joy	I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen    Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
surprise	Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support    you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so
neutral	Also so
neutral	Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
neutral	Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff!
neutral	OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
neutral	About what?
neutral	He's planning your birthday party.
joy	Oh my God! I love him!
fear	You'd better act surprised.
neutral	About what?
joy	My surprise party!
surprise	What surprise party?
non-neutral	Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
neutral	Well, he didn't tell me.
neutral	Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
anger	This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
neutral	No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
anger	Yuh-huh!
non-neutral	I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.
non-neutral	I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.
surprise	Looks like I was second to last.
neutral	Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad.
neutral	Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an invitation.
anger	Chandler! Hes your father; he should be at the wedding.
disgust	I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I havent seen him in years.
non-neutral	Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!
non-neutral	Well he doesnt have to know!
neutral	Its not like we run in the same circles.
disgust	I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
neutral	Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
non-neutral	Trust me, you dont want him there either.
neutral	Okay?
disgust	Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
neutral	So what! As long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil I dont care.
neutral	Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
neutral	Hello! Whos in there?
neutral	How ya doin?
non-neutral	Who in the hell are you?
neutral	I guess you wouldnt believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
fear	No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us!
non-neutral	No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
non-neutral	Im not gonna marry Chandler!
anger	Not after this!
neutral	Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo.
neutral	I gotta go.

neutral	Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?
neutral	Y'know what, actually  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
non-neutral	I thought you didn't smoke.
neutral	Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?
neutral	Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?
surprise	And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!"
neutral	But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
neutral	We get high.
neutral	Oh, me too.
neutral	I'm kidding.
non-neutral	Oh, me too.
non-neutral	Oh, are you sure you're ok?
neutral	Yeah.
sadness	Does it still hurt?
sadness	Yeah.

non-neutral	Come on!
disgust	They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous!

joy	Hey!
joy	Hey!
joy	Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
joy	Oh boy, me too!
neutral	Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours

neutral	You can take it off.
non-neutral	Just slice that baby right off!
neutral	Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing?
neutral	Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
neutral	Well that's not a third nipple.

neutral	Yeah? The work problem?
joy	Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.

joy	Very good,  so good.
joy	I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
sadness	Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didnt call.

non-neutral	Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
non-neutral	Come on! Look where you are!!
neutral	When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
neutral	Remember, a virgin for me please.
neutral	Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
neutral	Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy.
neutral	Well, if you think it will help.
anger	No!
non-neutral	That was a test!
non-neutral	In a couple of hours Im gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me!
non-neutral	And then after that, Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice
non-neutral	You should! How is she?
anger	Ohhh!!
joy	I think somebody needs another lap dance.
neutral	All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
surprise	You do?
surprise	You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman.
non-neutral	That and arrogance.
neutral	Hey.
joy	Hey! How was sailing?
joy	Wow thanks!
non-neutral	Joe?
joy	Yeah!
neutral	Uh, youve had a lot of sex right?
surprise	When? Today? Some, not a lot.
fear	Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt.
fear	There huhhmm, there-there was an incident.
neutral	Dont worry about that man, that happens.
surprise	Its happened to you?
neutral	Yeah! Once.
surprise	Well, whatd you do?
neutral	I did it anyway.
neutral	Sup? Sup dude?
fear	Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me.

surprise	Come on man, really how old?!
disgust	Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
surprise	And they knew about it?
surprise	Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
anger	Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
anger	Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just dont know what the big deal is!
non-neutral	The big deal is I dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! Cold beer.
neutral	Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
non-neutral	Do you always have to bring him here?
neutral	I didn't wanna leave him alone.
neutral	Alright?
neutral	We- we had our first fight this morning.
neutral	I think it has to do with my working late.
neutral	I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
neutral	Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
joy	Oh, that'd be great!
neutral	Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
neutral	Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
neutral	All right, check it out.
neutral	Check this out.
non-neutral	It says here that theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!
neutral	"Its almost as good as being there."
joy	Its better! You cant go to a museum in your underwear!
joy	Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
neutral	Uh, may I help you?
neutral	Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, Im the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.

neutral	I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore.
sadness	Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a
surprise	Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
neutral	I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
non-neutral	No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says hes gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
non-neutral	Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea.
neutral	Oh. Look, just friends, I wont grope you. I promise.
non-neutral	No, I just I think that its too soon.
neutral	No its not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
neutral	I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
surprise	And now you want that money back.
neutral	Exactly.
non-neutral	Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
non-neutral	Its not a real game! I made it up!
non-neutral	Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
neutral	I don't know.
neutral	But I can see through your sheet.
neutral	Yeah, yeah, that's her.
neutral	But y'know what?
sadness	Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
neutral	Why?
sadness	Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
surprise	What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
non-neutral	No. No. No. She lives on the
neutral	No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby.
neutral	And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway.
neutral	You've been counting wrong.
non-neutral	I did
non-neutral	Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this.
non-neutral	Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
surprise	Why? Do you have the answers written on there?

joy	Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
non-neutral	No you cant.
non-neutral	Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
non-neutral	You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long.
anger	Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
neutral	Okay.
sadness	Im sorry.
surprise	And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio.
fear	You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
neutral	Well, that shouldnt be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
neutral	Pete, can I get you something else?
neutral	Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if youre given em out.
neutral	Havent you and I covered that topic?
neutral	Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you.
non-neutral	Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
non-neutral	Well, if that were true, Id dating my Aunt Ruth.
disgust	And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.
neutral	Come on, you think she should go out with me, dont you?
non-neutral	Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?
disgust	I mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean.
disgust	That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
neutral	I mean really, think about it.
neutral	Ho-ho, I will.
surprise	I believe I read that somewhere!
anger	That only is not funny, it's physically impossible!
non-neutral	Ok?
non-neutral	Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...
anger	It's not funny!
anger	!
neutral	I respectfully disagree.
anger	I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
neutral	Who cares? Nobody reads those things
non-neutral	You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.
neutral	I don't have a page.
non-neutral	Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
non-neutral	I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
surprise	Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
non-neutral	No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
disgust	So, rocks.
sadness	I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
joy	Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?
joy	I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
surprise	Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
sadness	Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
neutral	You
neutral	Why?
joy	Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop.  Get up! Get up! Get up!
non-neutral	I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you dont think your son will think its yours and be horribly traumatised?
non-neutral	Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
neutral	Ohh, its time to go.
non-neutral	Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clocks a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes.
neutral	Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes?

neutral	I
joy	Are you kidding? I love that guy!  Mornings here! Morning is here
non-neutral	Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
neutral	Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
non-neutral	Monica, you dont even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
neutral	Yknow what? I am
sadness	Im sorry. Im so sorry.

neutral	Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
neutral	I think its best sir.

surprise	Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
anger	Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!
disgust	Great, now he's waving back.
disgust	Man, we gotta do something about that guy.
disgust	This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment.
non-neutral	It creeps me out!
anger	I feel like I can't do stuff!
non-neutral	What kinda stuff?
disgust	Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
surprise	You cook naked?
neutral	Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
surprise	What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
neutral	Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
non-neutral	Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt called. Not that I even care, y'know.
neutral	Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to.
anger	You think you know me so well.
neutral	Well, dont cha wanna?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Okay, well I do know you.
neutral	Thats what I said.
neutral	Well so?
sadness	I cant.
sadness	I cant.
sadness	She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone.
sadness	Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like all my lives.
neutral	Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
neutral	Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
neutral	It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
joy	It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
non-neutral	Nuh-uh.
non-neutral	Yuh-huh.
surprise	So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
disgust	Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.
surprise	This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
neutral	No.
non-neutral	Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
non-neutral	Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my
neutral	There you go.
non-neutral	Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
neutral	That's the rule.
anger	What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
non-neutral	How'd you get to that?
non-neutral	Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
surprise	You knew about that?
disgust	Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
neutral	Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
non-neutral	What do you mean, like, buy it together?
neutral	Yeah
non-neutral	You think we're ready for something like that?
neutral	Why not?
neutral	Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
non-neutral	Why, are you moving out?
neutral	I'm not moving out.
fear	You'd tell me if you were moving out right
neutral	Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
non-neutral	Aw, I know all about Kip!
non-neutral	It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
non-neutral	Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
non-neutral	Aw, don't do that
non-neutral	Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
neutral	Oh no, stay here well keep doing this. Ill pay you.
neutral	No, I got in trouble for that before. Ill see you later.
joy	Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss.
non-neutral	Oh my God! Oh my God! Im so sorry!
neutral	Aw forget it, its from
anger	You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! Im gonna kill you!!
sadness	Yknow this is actually not a great time for me.
joy	Okay! So, well just stay married.
joy	Yes, exactly!
joy	And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
non-neutral	Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Id have to talk you into this more.
fear	Okay, see now Im scared because I dont actually think youre kidding.
non-neutral	Im-Im not kidding. Look I-I, I cant have
surprise	What-wh-what so well just stay married forever?!
neutral	Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you?
non-neutral	Really?
joy	I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.!
neutral	Its
sadness	Ohh, okay, Im sorry.
neutral	Youre right.
neutral	Yknow what?
non-neutral	We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far
neutral	Im asking you to do me a favor.
non-neutral	You are asking me to be your wife!
neutral	And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
surprise	Oh my God!
non-neutral	I know, I know, I'm such an idiot.
non-neutral	I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week.
non-neutral	I mean, how clean can teeth get?
neutral	My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
neutral	Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
neutral	-leg?
neutral	That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
surprise	You actually broke her watch?
surprise	Ooh, steer clear of you.
neutral	That's right.
sadness	Barry, I'm sorry...
sadness	I am so sorry...
sadness	I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...
neutral	No real-, honey, really its fine, just g-go with Susan.
non-neutral	Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea.
neutral	Okay, okay, bye
neutral	So what are they doing?
non-neutral	I dont know, something girlie.
neutral	Hey, youre early.
surprise	What are you doing with the lamp?
neutral	Im just taking it to be re-wired.
disgust	Oh, well dont take it to the same place you took the stereo, cause theyve had that thing for over a week.
neutral	No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
anger	Youre disturbing my oboe practice.
non-neutral	You dont play the oboe!
anger	I could play the oboe!
joy	Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
joy	Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
anger	All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
surprise	What is going on?
anger	What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!

joy	Oh hi!
joy	Hi!

non-neutral	Great! Well umm
neutral	I think I might need one more cup of coffee.
neutral	Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
neutral	Okay.
sadness	Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him.
anger	Go!
surprise	What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
anger	I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wont quit.
neutral	I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
surprise	Oh God Oh, hes in there right now?
neutral	Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
non-neutral	Uh, lets rip!
surprise	Really? Are you sure?
joy	Oh Phoebe!
neutral	Okay, sorry. Yeah.
neutral	Hey Rach.

surprise	Did he tell you?
non-neutral	Oh, I....
joy	Oh, and hes got such a good heart! Doesnt he have a good heart?
non-neutral	Oh, I know...

neutral	Listen, can you do me a favor?
neutral	I'm gonna be out today.
neutral	Can you    just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
surprise	You don't trust him?
neutral	I think the check in is that way.
neutral	Ahh.
neutral	Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
non-neutral	Well theres some people who do want to marry me.
surprise	There are?
non-neutral	Yeah! Richard!
surprise	R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?!
neutral	Thats right.
neutral	Chandler
surprise	You just told me that he hates marriage!
non-neutral	That-that hes a-a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife!
non-neutral	That-that hes against marriage and always will be!
neutral	You got
fear	You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
neutral	I knew.
surprise	You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
neutral	I did.
sadness	Oh.
fear	Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?
neutral	Sometime?
neutral	Maybe?
non-neutral	Yeah, maybe...
joy	Okay... okay, maybe I will...
surprise	Why?
neutral	Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
joy	Well, youre amazing.
neutral	Oh no-no-no.
surprise	A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
non-neutral	Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
joy	Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
non-neutral	Oh, I dont know.
joy	Oh-no-no-no, you are!
joy	You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that.
neutral	You mean with Casey.
neutral	No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes pretty cool.
neutral	Or Casey.
neutral	No-no, Kathy.
neutral	Could be Casey.
neutral	No. No, Kathy.
neutral	Consider Casey.
non-neutral	Yknow what I think?
joy	I think somebodys got a little crush on Casey.
non-neutral	How bout I fix you two up?
non-neutral	What do you think?
joy	That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
neutral	Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
neutral	Honey, whats the matter?
neutral	I just saw Janice.
non-neutral	Cause every time I see your face, I cant help but fall from grace. I know.....
non-neutral	Wow! This girl is good.
non-neutral	Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
neutral	I like her.
neutral	Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
neutral	Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from these people.
non-neutral	Look at you. All jealous.
neutral	Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, shes more.. y'know, and youre more
neutral	beside meeeee-eeee-ee. .

neutral	Oh no, one of those look for the hidden meaning songs.
neutral	Yes, hello.
neutral	I have a question.
neutral	Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.
neutral	A beard and a moustache.
neutral	Thank you.
neutral	No,
surprise	What?! What else did he say?
neutral	Umm, he said he thought I was funny.
neutral	So Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
non-neutral	Ross, no! There is
neutral	Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
non-neutral	Ross, I am a human doodle!!
neutral	Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun!
neutral	Okay?
neutral	And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna
neutral	Okay, there was
non-neutral	Come on!
non-neutral	Oh wait, dont you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies?

neutral	Oh yeah? Okay.
neutral	Okay.
surprise	But! Dont you have to give him his money back?
non-neutral	Uh-huh.  Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you.  Okay, lets go see Monica!
surprise	Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
neutral	You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
non-neutral	So?!
surprise	Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade?
non-neutral	Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
neutral	Oh right, right.
non-neutral	I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
surprise	Well usually...yeah!
neutral	Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
neutral	Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me.
sadness	Im such a jerk.
neutral	Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
joy	Hmmm... this is so nice.
neutral	OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
neutral	OK.
neutral	OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
surprise	Ohhh!!!!
neutral	Yes, yes, that's right...
surprise	Oh, look at the little cat!
surprise	What?  Ow!
neutral	Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
neutral	I didn't mean
non-neutral	Why not?
joy	It's brilliant!
joy	Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!
neutral	well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding...
neutral	Thank you, Chandler.
neutral	Sincerely.
joy	Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
non-neutral	How do you think I should propose?
neutral	David, I'm pretending to
joy	Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  Come on Joey! You cant win if you dont ask any
surprise	What?!
joy	Well, you promised me a fun road trip!
anger	Weve been on the road six hours and youve been asleep for five and a half!
non-neutral	We are switching at the next rest stop and
neutral	All right. All right.
non-neutral	Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radios broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
surprise	Really? I dont
anger	Sing!!
non-neutral	Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
joy	Morning!
joy	Everything was delicious!
joy	Thank you!
joy	It was. The duck in particular was superb.
joy	Thank you!    You haven't said anything...
neutral	Actually I do have one small complaint.
neutral	Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
non-neutral	The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind    of a mood-killer!
surprise	What musician?
neutral	We did?
non-neutral	You owe me 20 bucks.
joy	Thank you. Thank you so much!
neutral	Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
surprise	Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?
non-neutral	What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
neutral	All right, I'm nine years old.
non-neutral	Oh, I hate this story.
neutral	We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
sadness	I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
surprise	Oh my god.
sadness	Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
surprise	Hey, who's this little naked guy?
neutral	That little naked guy would be me.
surprise	Aww, look at the little thing.
non-neutral	Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
surprise	Who are those people?
surprise	Got me.
neutral	Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
surprise	Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
neutral	Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
neutral	Looks like a fun gang.
joy	Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
non-neutral	Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
non-neutral	So, whats this about?
neutral	Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
neutral	No.  This is my red sweater.
fear	Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me? Okay.
non-neutral	Whats going on Rach?
non-neutral	Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
non-neutral	Yknow, Im actually glad Phoebe called.
non-neutral	I know we broke up because you thought I wasnt mature enough, but Ive really grown up and think we should get back together.
non-neutral	Oh, its just not the right time.
non-neutral	It is the right time.
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	Kay!

neutral	I wont speed.
neutral	And you promise youll get this taken care of right away?
neutral	I promise.

neutral	Yeah!
neutral	Can he handle the stick?
neutral	Oh well
non-neutral	I can handle the stick!!
joy	Hey!
joy	Hey!
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Oh hi.

surprise	Weirdest thing. Did I hearMother of God its true!
surprise	Chandler Bing!
surprise	Jan-Janice!
non-neutral	Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
neutral	Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.
surprise	Janice I didnt even know you were pregnant! Whos the unwitting human whos essence youve stolen?
neutral	Its you. This is yours.
surprise	What?!
joy	Look how nervous he gets! We havent slept together in years!
fear	Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
non-neutral	Man, Im starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
neutral	Yknow, yknow Im lookin and I dont think anyones home here.
neutral	I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and yknow explain later.
surprise	Yeah? Really? No ones home?
neutral	I dont think so. Hello?  When you get in there
neutral	Hey, what's up?
sadness	I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
sadness	Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
anger	Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
anger	You had no relationship!!
anger	No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
anger	Oh God, stop with the plan!
neutral	So what, so what you saw him with a girl?
anger	Who cares?!
anger	That doesn't mean anything!
neutral	Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
non-neutral	She was kinda stupid.
neutral	You're right.
neutral	All right, I'm just gonna go on the date.
neutral	I'm gonna go on the date.
neutral	That is the new plan.
non-neutral	Come on, hurry!
neutral	Hi.

anger	Stupid Jane Rogers!!
surprise	You are having a party tonight??
neutral	Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
non-neutral	And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were    gonna get away with that?
neutral	I do it every year.
surprise	You do that every year??
anger	I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
non-neutral	Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us??
neutral	Yeah...
non-neutral	And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times    restaurant?
neutral	Yeah...
non-neutral	OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime    tour of that button factory?
surprise	Who's this from?
neutral	Oh, that's Ross's.
surprise	Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered.
neutral	Remembered what?
surprise	It was like months ago.
non-neutral	We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.
surprise	Oh!
surprise	I can't believe he remembered!
surprise	Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
surprise	I can't believe he did this.
neutral	Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
surprise	What did you just say?
fear	F-hah.... flennin....
surprise	Oh.... my God.
joy	I really like waking up with you.
joy	I like waking up with you too.  Oh! It's such a beautiful morning.  Oh, I can stay here all day.
joy	That would be great!

non-neutral	Wait, just a second.
surprise	Okay.  Oh! Oh no.
sadness	Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from
surprise	Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
joy	Hi!
surprise	This is Bonnie?  This is Bonnie?  Youre Bonnie?
neutral	I can show you an ID if you want?
surprise	Oh no, Im sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
neutral	Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
neutral	Oh, that must be it.
neutral	Well I hope you have fun tonight.
joy	Thanks! You too.
neutral	I believe it.
non-neutral	No you dont.
neutral	Yes, I do.
anger	No you doy'know what, youre not gonna suck me into this.
anger	Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
anger	I do not always have to beokay, okay.
neutral	Jurassic Park
fear	I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
neutral	Maybe we should check the trash chute.
neutral	Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
neutral	That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	There he is!
anger	Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!
neutral	Just, y'know out.
non-neutral	Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
neutral	What were you doing?
neutral	I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
non-neutral	You walked around all night in the city by yourself?

joy	I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
surprise	But my apartment!
neutral	Was the setting of Phoebes triumph.
non-neutral	But the mess!
neutral	Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
neutral	Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out.
neutral	Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!
neutral	When will that be?
neutral	!
non-neutral	Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
joy	Hey!
joy	Hey Ross! The babys kicking!

neutral	Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi.
neutral	Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
neutral	You didnt say Boutros Boutros Gali.
neutral	Boutros Boutros Gali.
neutral	He says he was too.
neutral	Interesting.
neutral	So I was wondering....
non-neutral	Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
joy	Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.

neutral	Well, I was having a conversation.
anger	Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I havent been able to say two words to each other.

neutral	That would be great. Thank you.
disgust	so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera!
neutral	Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.

non-neutral	Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera!
disgust	Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
joy	Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it.
non-neutral	Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
neutral	Here, I'll get it.
neutral	We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
joy	Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
non-neutral	Oh, great!
non-neutral	Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!
surprise	That was unbelievable!

neutral	Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story.
non-neutral	Oh dad, really you dont need to
non-neutral	Well, Id gotten Judy pregnant. I still dont know how that happened.

surprise	Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
surprise	Was it not pain-free?
disgust	No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
neutral	Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad.
non-neutral	Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.
neutral	But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest.
surprise	Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
non-neutral	Now, are you glad we didnt start with the bikini strips?

joy	And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
neutral	Yeah that's the same.
non-neutral	That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
neutral	Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
neutral	Which one?
sadness	Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
non-neutral	Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about.
sadness	Y'know, for me anyway.
sadness	And of course, the Indians.
anger	Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
neutral	Hi, guys.

neutral	So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain.
neutral	So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
joy	...and live forever as a machine!
joy	That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?
neutral	You and I, we're interfacing.
non-neutral	Yeah, I gotta go.
joy	Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
neutral	David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
neutral	Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
neutral	See?
non-neutral	Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
neutral	Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
neutral	Oh, I should go, too.
neutral	Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
non-neutral	Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there.
non-neutral	And she was like "Oh, don't worry!
neutral	I asked him.
non-neutral	He's totally ok with seeing you!".
joy	So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
non-neutral	Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
non-neutral	Exactly!
neutral	And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
non-neutral	I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,
neutral	Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
joy	Ok, that'll be great!
disgust	Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
disgust	That's not what we're gonna do!
disgust	Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
joy	Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
neutral	Hello Skidmark.
neutral	Its a nickname, Ill explain later.
neutral	Its pretty clear.
neutral	Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
surprise	Thats why you broke up with me?
non-neutral	You-you-you didnt know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!
joy	Ni-chou chi-ma!
non-neutral	Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
neutral	Hi everyone.
neutral	I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
non-neutral	Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
neutral	Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
fear	What did, what did he say?
neutral	Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.
neutral	So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so.
neutral	.
neutral	.
joy	Oh, great!
joy	We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
non-neutral	Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly.
joy	All I could think of was yknow, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
neutral	And did he?
joy	Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
neutral	Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
joy	I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks today and Ive only had six.
non-neutral	Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.
sadness	Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I?
disgust	You sound like a guy.
disgust	No, a guy would be saying, "Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."
surprise	Oh my God!
non-neutral	Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!
surprise	Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up!
sadness	I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again.
neutral	Youll have a last kiss.
joy	Thank you so much for coming back over.
non-neutral	Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
neutral	I know Mona, just hear me out.
neutral	First of all, Im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own.
neutral	Youre gonna have to tell me how you did that.
neutral	Focus.
neutral	Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are
neutral	All right wheres that turkey!
surprise	Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
joy	Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
neutral	No.
anger	No!
non-neutral	Yes!
neutral	Ahh.
joy	Oh, would you look at that Monica?
joy	I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
anger	Okay, Im next.  Dont! Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe!
joy	Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.
anger	Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!
neutral	Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
neutral	Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
neutral	Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.
non-neutral	But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
non-neutral	I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!
non-neutral	Or Friday with no two pizzas!
non-neutral	All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over.
joy	No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!
non-neutral	All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
joy	Thats right!
joy	Cause Im a Tribbiani!
neutral	And this is what we do!
non-neutral	I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we dont read a lot or run very fast, but damnit!
joy	We can eat!
neutral	Well?
surprise	Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
joy	Look at this!
surprise	Oh! You have a window!
joy	Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...
surprise	Oh look! That guy's peeing!
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Hi.
non-neutral	Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
neutral	Ohh.
neutral	Okay. Lets use this brush.
neutral	Okay. This stuff?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	All right.
neutral	Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
neutral	Oke-dokey.
neutral	Where exactly is your zoo?
neutral	Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.
neutral	Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
neutral	Yes.
neutral	Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
non-neutral	No-no, he's, he's very docile.
neutral	Even if he were... cornered?
neutral	Well I, I don't know. Why?
neutral	Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
non-neutral	He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
neutral	How about a hammer, or a small blade?
non-neutral	Why- why- why would he need a blade?
non-neutral	Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something.
neutral	Otherwise it's just cruel.
joy	He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
neutral	We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
neutral	...He's in.
joy	He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
disgust	You're making a big mistake here.
neutral	I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
non-neutral	My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.
joy	Really helped speed the process along!
surprise	Janice!
surprise	You're not... gone?
surprise	Oh!
neutral	Sid is still in his room.
non-neutral	I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him.
surprise	So did you do it?
neutral	Did you make your deposit?
joy	Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
fear	That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
non-neutral	I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
neutral	Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
non-neutral	Phoebe, where's your purse?
non-neutral	No, no! Give it to me!
anger	You can't have it.
anger	Give it to me!
anger	No
anger	I'll go in there.
non-neutral	Oh yeah.
neutral	Phoebe come here
joy	Haha!
anger	Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
disgust	What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
neutral	I just had sex.
surprise	Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
neutral	Well, you never told me how old you were.
disgust	Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
joy	I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
fear	Don't say it.
joy	...in love with you.
surprise	Really?
sadness	Sorry.
anger	Well,fall out of it.
anger	You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night.
non-neutral	Oh god, oh god.
disgust	I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.
disgust	I'm Joan Collins.
neutral	Who?
non-neutral	Thats right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!
neutral	Uh sweetie, maybe youd be more comfortable here?
anger	You. Like you havent done enough.
neutral	Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.
neutral	I mean I wish I were a seahorse.
neutral	Because with seahorses its the male, they carry the babies.
non-neutral	And then also umm, Id be far away in the sea.
non-neutral	God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
neutral	Oh I know, Ive been there. I remember toward the end
neutral	Oh Phoebe, thats a great story.
non-neutral	Can you tell it to me when youre getting me some iced tea?
anger	Oh God, get out!
anger	Get out!!
anger	Get out!!
anger	Get out!
anger	!
neutral	Lets.
joy	All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itll be okay.
fear	Oh my God.Whats he gonna do now?
fear	I cant watch!
neutral	Oh.
non-neutral	Seriously, how can you watch this?
non-neutral	Arent you scared?
fear	Terrified.
joy	Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
neutral	Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
surprise	Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse?
neutral	Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine.
neutral	I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
neutral	Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I
joy	Fine! Maybe I will too!
non-neutral	Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
non-neutral	You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
non-neutral	MY SANDWICH?!!!
anger	MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
neutral	Whats the matter, Pheebs?
non-neutral	She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
surprise	What?!
sadness	Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.
sadness	Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is.
sadness	She knows, and she wont tell me.
sadness	Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
sadness	Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet.
neutral	Where ya going?
neutral	Well, shes out of town so, theres gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
fear	Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
anger	Well, are any of those people here?!
surprise	Oh my God, so do I!
surprise	I knew it, wow!!
neutral	Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
joy	Ohh, so cute.
anger	Uh-huh, well! But umm, still Im-Im mad at you.
non-neutral	I know. Im mad at me too.
neutral	Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? Im kinda hungry.
surprise	Hey! Me too!
non-neutral	All right, stop it. Now youre just doing it to freak me out.
neutral	Ok, you can do this.
neutral	It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.
neutral	Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
sadness	Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
anger	All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.
surprise	Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
surprise	Really?  My God, hes really cute.
neutral	Go for it.
surprise	Phoebe, Im engaged!
neutral	Im just saying, get his number just in case.
neutral	But no: Chandler is in an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
non-neutral	Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, Im engaged.
disgust	Well you should be embarrassed.
joy	I did, but that was really fun.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Chandler. I sensed it was you.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Unagi. Im always aware.
non-neutral	Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?
neutral	Whats up?
neutral	I cant figure out what to make Monica.
non-neutral	Oh, why dont you make her one of your little jokes.
fear	Im going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
neutral	Yknow what?
neutral	Shed-shed love this.
non-neutral	Uh, its an exact replica of Apollo 8.
neutral	I made it in the sixth grade.
neutral	Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
neutral	Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon.
non-neutral	But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
non-neutral	Wait a minute, I cant give this to her.
neutral	Why not?
non-neutral	Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
neutral	Yeah, see ya.
joy	Hey, thank you so much.
non-neutral	Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
neutral	No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
anger	Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
neutral	He might still show up.
anger	Oh, what are you, stupid? Its been three hours.
neutral	Is that all?
sadness	I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding?
neutral	Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding.
neutral	Um, its going to be a small ceremony.
surprise	Uh, tiny!
neutral	Were not even sure why were having it.
neutral	Its actually going to be just family.
surprise	Ohwaityou two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing
neutral	Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
joy	Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
joy	Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
neutral	Well, I brought the next best thing.
surprise	Whoa!  Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
joy	Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
joy	Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
joy	You're so sweet!
joy	Ohh, you're so sweet!
surprise	Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
neutral	Huh.
non-neutral	Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
neutral	Uhh.
anger	You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
neutral	Nah.
fear	How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape, a rapist or a killer or something!
surprise	Dont you think I asked him that before he got in?!
anger	Yknow what? Im not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!
anger	No!
neutral	Do you like car games?
neutral	Yeah, yknow the license plate game?
neutral	I
joy	Ooh, Ill play! Ill play!
non-neutral	No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
neutral	Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica?
non-neutral	I cant figure this out!
non-neutral	Its so hard!
non-neutral	Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah!
non-neutral	Paper cut!
neutral	Now, have you told anyone else?
neutral	No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont want Monica to find out.
surprise	You told me.
non-neutral	Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
surprise	Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadnt been on the toilet.
neutral	Me too.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey.
non-neutral	Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
neutral	Oh all right.
neutral	Yeah, coffeehouse.
neutral	Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
neutral	Oh well, we dont because we gottheother pl-place.
disgust	How rude.
surprise	Oh, Im sorry. You wanna bite?
surprise	The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
surprise	What?
surprise	The ring is gone!
disgust	Ugh.
non-neutral	Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisAh-ha-ha!!
non-neutral	You lost the ring!
anger	Youre the worst best man ever!
anger	Dude, this isnt funny!
fear	What am I gonna do?!
non-neutral	I go to bed last night, everythings cool!
non-neutral	I wake up this morning, the strippers gone and the ring is gone!
surprise	You slept with the stripper?
non-neutral	Of course!!
anger	What difference does that make?!
non-neutral	Well, I'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
neutral	Joey, do you have a minute?
fear	Dude, what am I gonna
non-neutral	Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
fear	Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
neutral	Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
non-neutral	Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have
neutral	What-what is it, what is it?
surprise	Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
non-neutral	Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
non-neutral	Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
disgust	I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
surprise	What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
disgust	And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
non-neutral	I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone
anger	I'm not listening to you!
joy	Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it!
non-neutral	Stick to your side!
non-neutral	Hey, come on now!
neutral	All right, what are we havin?
neutral	Uhh, I dont believe in these crazy diets yknow, just everything in moderation.
neutral	Ill take those to go.  For the kids.
neutral	Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
non-neutral	It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldnt have said.
neutral	But believe me, thats not gonna happen today.
neutral	Understood. So, whatd you say back then?
neutral	Well, I said that I
neutral	Ha!
joy	So you like the drums!
joy	That's, that's great!
neutral	Yknow, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation.
non-neutral	All right, okay, well, apparently not!
joy	So, yay!
neutral	Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four...
joy	Tequila!!
joy	That's fun.
surprise	Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
sadness	Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
anger	Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
fear	Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we just forget about it.
anger	Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed.
neutral	All right thats it, school is in session!
surprise	My God! Is this a gym card?
neutral	Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but Ive missed the last 1200 times.
neutral	So why dont you quit?
non-neutral	You dont think Ive tried? You think I
neutral	Who is Maria?
joy	Oh Maria. You cant say no to her, shes like this lycra spandex covered gymtreat.
neutral	You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
anger	No!
neutral	So youre strong enough to face her on your own?
fear	Oh no, youll have to come.
neutral	Thanks.
neutral	Thank you.  Mon?
neutral	Hmm?
neutral	Pheebs, I dont think anyone's mad about that.
non-neutral	Exactly! Because it's in the past!
neutral	Anybody gonna eat that?
joy	Pheebs!
joy	Hey!
neutral	Listen, you know how uh, when youre wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
non-neutral	Yeah!
surprise	Well, when Jake did it I saw thathe was wearing womens underwear!
neutral	I know. They were mine.
disgust	Oh.  No! No wait, thats weird!
neutral	No, its not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
disgust	Thats weird!
neutral	Im wearing his briefs right now.
non-neutral	Thatskinda hot.
joy	I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
neutral	Yeah, I wouldnt know about that.
joy	And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
disgust	Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
non-neutral	There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinking even more than you.
disgust	Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.
non-neutral	Im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear!
non-neutral	I dont think you could ever do that.
non-neutral	Hey! I
disgust	Okay, whatever.
neutral	Lusts of the flesh.
neutral	What?
neutral	I dont know.  A cowboy theme?
neutral	Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
joy	Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it's beautiful I love it!
neutral	Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya.
joy	Hey!
neutral	Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
neutral	Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my  breast?
neutral	It's all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but don't worry. It'll happen.
surprise	Yowsa!
neutral	Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your  mouth.
non-neutral	Dear Lord.
neutral	I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?
neutral	Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…
non-neutral	Oh look, she's pulling away again!
neutral	Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?
neutral	She looks scared.
neutral	Doesn't she  look scared?
neutral	Y'know, I don't really know her.
neutral	Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
neutral	No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
neutral	Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
neutral	Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."
neutral	Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
non-neutral	Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
anger	No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.
non-neutral	The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
non-neutral	Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
neutral	Pathetic mess?
neutral	I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.
joy	I'm thinkin', cha-ching!
neutral	Thanks.
neutral	Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice.
neutral	You're doin' this.
neutral	Hi. She said yes.
joy	Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?
joy	"Happy birthday to you!"
neutral	Youre paying for that.
surprise	What? No-no its her birthday!
surprise	Youve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
neutral	But it really
neutral	You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
anger	Damnit!
joy	Rach? Hi!
joy	Hi!
neutral	Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
neutral	Well yeah
surprise	Oh wow!
surprise	I mean, wow!
non-neutral	I mean, I-I-I think shes cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
surprise	Really?!
non-neutral	Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
neutral	Oh so-so not really never.
neutral	I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.
neutral	I mean after all weve been through, I justyknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.
neutral	Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
non-neutral	Oh-ho, and mine!
non-neutral	Okay, sono toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
fear	No-no wait-wait! I cant just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
neutral	WellI only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.
non-neutral	Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
sadness	Its just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
neutral	Chandler?
non-neutral	I-Im sorry?
non-neutral	No look, I-Im sure that people know you exist!
non-neutral	Oh yeah?
neutral	I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.
sadness	Ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk.
neutral	Hang-hang on.
neutral	Hey everybody!
sadness	Uh, Im gonna kill myself!
neutral	Ill get back to ya.
neutral	I got nothing.
neutral	Wait.
neutral	Uh, hey Marge!
neutral	Ehh, nothing.
non-neutral	Nothing.
surprise	Apparently, theres like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and theres only this one robot and this one guy who controls it!
surprise	I didnt know he could get me fired!
fear	What am I going to do?
neutral	Well yknow Joey, youre a pretty charming guy.
fear	Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
neutral	No sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! Youve got to kiss some serious robot ass!

surprise	I didn't know there were docks.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey.
sadness	Aww, is it broken?
non-neutral	No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
neutral	Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
non-neutral	Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
non-neutral	Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
surprise	What is this? Fruit?
neutral	Monica's making jam.
joy	Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
neutral	Because the kids need new shoes.
neutral	I'm going into business people.
non-neutral	I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard.
non-neutral	I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.
neutral	What's the opposite of man?
neutral	Jam.
fear	Oh Joey don't!
non-neutral	It's way to hot.
neutral	This will just be my batch.
non-neutral	Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
surprise	Why? Do you think hes still mad at us?
neutral	Well hes probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
surprise	What? Mine arent tinted.
neutral	Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
neutral	I will have one.
neutral	Okay, Im not gonna have one.
neutral	Neither will I.
non-neutral	No, no, its just my tooth.
neutral	All right Ill have one.
neutral	So whats a matter, you need a dentist? Ive got a good one.
fear	No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him.
neutral	See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
surprise	Why? Why cant you go to him?
non-neutral	Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
joy	That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienists blouse.
surprise	Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
non-neutral	Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob.
surprise	And all these people actually died?
non-neutral	Yes, while I was in the chair!
neutral	Thats why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, its not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
neutral	Pheebs, come on, you didnt kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.
neutral	Its, its, its just ah, a coincidence.
non-neutral	Well tell that to them. Oh! You cant, their dead.
surprise	Hello?
neutral	Ross.
non-neutral	Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
sadness	It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
joy	No, no, that-that, thats all right. Umm, Im just glad you called.
non-neutral	Ross umm, theres something that Ive got to tell you, theres-theres someone else.
non-neutral	Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
non-neutral	You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
sadness	Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
neutral	So, let's go.
neutral	Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
neutral	Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.
neutral	You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
neutral	Okay, Ive got three of my five.
neutral	Three of your five, what?
neutral	Celebrities Im allowed to sleep with.
surprise	Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
neutral	Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left.
neutral	All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
joy	Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
surprise	Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
neutral	Susan Sarandon.
disgust	Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
joy	And!! Isabella Rosselini.
joy	Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around.
neutral	So?
neutral	So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time.
neutral	Yeah, cause thats why you wont get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
non-neutral	Oh thats five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesnt she want to come out?
neutral	Yknow what I think it is?
neutral	I think youve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesnt want to leave.
non-neutral	Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
neutral	Twenty-one hours, youre a hero.
non-neutral	Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
neutral	Actually, I think youre ready to go to the delivery room.
surprise	What?
neutral	Ten centimeters, youre about to become a mom.
surprise	My God. Okay.  Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
neutral	Are they here yet?

neutral	No, I know, but Ihe just went on.
non-neutral	He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
anger	No no no! Federal regulations!
neutral	OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is
neutral	Alright. What's the message?
neutral	Uh... I don't know.
neutral	Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
neutral	What?
neutral	It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
surprise	: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about!
anger	There's no Rachel!
non-neutral	Don't give me that deep freeze.
neutral	Here's the thing, Janice.
neutral	You know, I mean, it's like we're different.
non-neutral	I'm like the bing, bing, bing.
neutral	You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.

non-neutral	Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
non-neutral	Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
non-neutral	I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
surprise	Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?
non-neutral	Oh, I don't know, a million?
neutral	Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
neutral	I'm fine.
neutral	All right.
fear	I'm not fine. Here she comes.
neutral	Wait here. Breathe.
surprise	How do you do that?
neutral	It's like a gift.
neutral	We should always always break up together.
neutral	Oh, I'd like that.
non-neutral	You win.
neutral	Well, what did you have?
non-neutral	It doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six.

neutral	Okay, now much have you won so far?
surprise	Uh,  wow, 700.
surprise	Not 700 exactly?
neutral	Yeah.
non-neutral	Double it!
surprise	What?
neutral	Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
surprise	Really?
neutral	Hey, I didnt make up the rules.
neutral	Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card.
neutral	Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.
surprise	Dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getNo way!
sadness	Im, Im sorry you didnt get to go to Spacecamp, and Im hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it.

joy	Pheebs, thats great!
joy	Oh, yay!
neutral	But yknow umm, Rachel doesnt rhyme with draddle.
disgust	I know but its so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
neutral	What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.

neutral	Not her.
neutral	Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I cant decide between the two of them.
neutral	Yknow the one from Poughkeepsie, even though shes a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun.
neutral	But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown.
neutral	Yknow shes, well shes-shes just as pretty, I guess shes smart, shes
neutral	If shes no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
neutral	Well, I-I want to give her another chance, yknow?
neutral	She lives so close.
neutral	And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasif she was kidding was very funny.

neutral	Hi.
sadness	Listen, Im sorry about that whole thing with Roger.
non-neutral	It really wasnt right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think youll really enjoy.

neutral	Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
surprise	Janice?
surprise	Oh.... my.... God.
non-neutral	Hey, it's Janice.
non-neutral	Well, okay so, I dont have it all worked out quite yet. Just dont say anything to Rachel, please?
neutral	Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
non-neutral	Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!

neutral	Your mom called me. So is this her?
neutral	No, this is a loaner.
neutral	I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
neutral	I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game?
neutral	Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
neutral	Yeah, they're not so bad.
neutral	Im sorry I wont be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but Im

neutral	I just called a friend of mine.
surprise	Yeah?
neutral	I think I may be able to book
surprise	Really?!

sadness	Im sorry daddy.
non-neutral	I dont believe this!!
fear	Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
anger	Stay calm?!!
anger	How do you expect me to stay calm?!
anger	This is unacceptable Rachel!
anger	And I wanna know why?!!
anger	Is it because that punk Ross wont marry you?!
non-neutral	Thats it!
anger	Is that it?
non-neutral	!
sadness	Yes. Yes, he says Im damaged goods.
surprise	So, youre like a zillionaire?
surprise	And youre our age. Youre our age.

joy	Now get out of here you!!
non-neutral	Okay, Im running out of places I can touch him!
sadness	Look, is there something wrong with me?
sadness	I mean why am I only attracted to guys where theres no future?
sadness	Either theyre too old, or theyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me, and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on!
sadness	I mean, seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me?
neutral	!
neutral	No.
neutral	Okay, Im gonna go get Frank.
neutral	So, were walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, Hey, lets go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes, remember?
non-neutral	And then, and then, you turn to me and say, Nah, lets just hang out at your place. Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
neutral	Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
anger	You know what else Im not gonna miss?
anger	"Im Monica.
anger	I wash the toilet 17 times a day.
anger	Even if people are on it!"
anger	"Hi Im Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, Id better wash it and shrink it!"
anger	"Im Monica, I dont get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
non-neutral	Hey! I call her!
anger	"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
anger	"Oh my God, I cant find a boyfriend!
anger	So I guess Ill just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
neutral	Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
neutral	Item J437-A, color: winterberry.
neutral	Hi umm, listen come here, come in.
sadness	Im so-so sorry about yesterday.
sadness	I-Im really sorry.
non-neutral	Its just that I
neutral	Listen Ross, you dont have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
surprise	You do?
non-neutral	Yeah, you still have feelings for me.
joy	And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you.
sadness	And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we cant.
sadness	Its too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasnt meant to be.
non-neutral	Oh God youre right.
sadness	Ross, wewe have to be strong. Okay, I-Im gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?
neutral	No.
neutral	Im telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
neutral	Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I dont want to make it savory.
neutral	Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
neutral	Gimme this.
neutral	Hi! Okay, dont be mad at me, but I couldnt resist.
surprise	Brides magazines?
neutral	Yes, and I know that youd say no if he asked you, but Im sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
non-neutral	Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.
non-neutral	It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.
non-neutral	I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean I cant.
non-neutral	Right?
non-neutral	I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
surprise	Oh my God.
neutral	I know.  I need more pie.
neutral	Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
surprise	You didnt break up with that fireman?
neutral	No, that was my way of telling you.
neutral	Well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.
neutral	He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
surprise	Wow!
neutral	Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
neutral	So then, are you going to dump Jason?
neutral	Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now sos Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?
neutral	So Its really just about the math.
neutral	Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
anger	Ok, look! Enough is enough!
non-neutral	No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
neutral	Monica, that was also true an
non-neutral	I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
neutral	But...
non-neutral	Look!
neutral	You knew this about me when you married me!
neutral	You agreed to take me in sickness and in health.
non-neutral	Well, this is my sickness!
neutral	Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
neutral	Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
neutral	Yeah me too, all night.
surprise	Really?! How come we didnt cross paths?
neutral	Yeah well thats because uhI stayed in my room. Yeah, you dont want to look in my hamper.
surprise	I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there!
surprise	Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker
neutral	Yeah, okay lets leave these two alone.
disgust	No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
non-neutral	Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
neutral	So.
neutral	So.
neutral	I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.
neutral	I mean, you know, we've never really talked.
neutral	I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
fear	I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
surprise	Really? Me?
neutral	Yes.
surprise	Oh my god, are you kidding?
non-neutral	Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
neutral	Well, you're not totally paranoid.
non-neutral	Oy.
non-neutral	Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
neutral	Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
joy	Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
neutral	I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
neutral	All right, Julie.
neutral	Bye.
disgust	Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.
joy	Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
neutral	Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with the one I picked first.
anger	Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over!
surprise	What?
non-neutral	Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
surprise	They put you in jail?
non-neutral	The little jail between the doors!
anger	Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
non-neutral	I know, Im sorry! But yknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
non-neutral	Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
neutral	Maybe it was the guy.
non-neutral	It was the ring!
neutral	No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
neutral	Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
non-neutral	No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
neutral	Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
neutral	Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend.
surprise	Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
joy	We can, we can go to Aruba!
sadness	When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.
sadness	You would've liked it.
neutral	I had a bra.
neutral	Hey, Dr. Farber.
neutral	All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
surprise	What?!
non-neutral	I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
surprise	Oh my God! What does
neutral	Oh that's an eye removal machine.
non-neutral	All right, I'm outta here!
joy	I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	So were done then!
neutral	Almost! But first, we gotta start.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	This is a glaucoma test.
neutral	Uh-huh.
neutral	Sit down.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
surprise	What?!
non-neutral	A small puff of air, now come on!
fear	Sure, now Im scared.
neutral	No, we can go together! Just dont wait too long though, okay? Cause Im outta here sometime before Friday.
fear	Yeah, but I dont wanna die!
joy	No-no, itll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
neutral	Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
neutral	Oh, hey.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Youve have lipstick right here . Thats okay, its mine, we just kissed.
surprise	Hey!
surprise	Hey!
non-neutral	Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
neutral	No. Y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail.
non-neutral	Yeah!
neutral	Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
surprise	Youre building a post office?
neutral	No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. Its a one day job, max.
surprise	Okay.  My word! Those are snug.
neutral	Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valentes.
neutral	Power saw kinda got away from me there.
joy	Hi!
non-neutral	Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
neutral	So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?
sadness	I cant seem to say goodbye.
surprise	Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
non-neutral	Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
neutral	It was cheesecake.
neutral	It was fine.
surprise	It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  Wow!
joy	My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
non-neutral	Yknow what? Forget it!
neutral	Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted.
neutral	Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
neutral	Mommas Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
neutral	This ones from me.
surprise	Ahh!
neutral	It wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its really fun.
surprise	A scooter!
neutral	Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
joy	No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
joy	Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys?
neutral	For my last birthday you gave me a
neutral	Okay.
joy	Happy birthday Grandma!
neutral	Its better to be over the hill  then buried under it.
neutral	All our love Monica and Chandler.
joy	Thats funny, yeah!
surprise	No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
joy	No, I know! I get it! Its funny!
non-neutral	No, because youre not a grandmother!
non-neutral	No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I dont have any of those things.
neutral	Thats why its so funny.
non-neutral	All you had to do was buy the card!
neutral	Hey, Joey. What's going on?
neutral	Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
non-neutral	Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
non-neutral	Sorry. Wrong boobies.
neutral	Hello, Joey.
non-neutral	Oh! ...Hello, dear.
surprise	Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
joy	I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
surprise	Really?
disgust	No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
neutral	Hey, buddy.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Oh, that's attractive.
non-neutral	Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
disgust	Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
neutral	Oh, ah- the kid has it.
anger	The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
neutral	You gotta do it, man.
non-neutral	Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatevercan't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
anger	'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
anger	Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
anger	GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
anger	...Now
joy	Oh, look, wish me luck!
neutral	What for?
neutral	I'm gonna go get one of those  job things.
neutral	Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. Thats good right?
non-neutral	You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
surprise	What? Hes gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!
joy	Hi!
joy	Im so glad you could make it.
non-neutral	Yes, thank you so much. And again, were so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
non-neutral	Try. Theres my little girl.
neutral	Shes still mad.
joy	Yeah I know. Isnt it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
surprise	Phoebe, Sandras mad at you too. It-it doesnt bother you?
neutral	Oh, thats veryReally very-very okay.
joy	Julies cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, thats about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
neutral	Have you felt Rachels cervix Ross?
disgust	No, I dont think well be doing that.
disgust	Were not gonna do that.
neutral	Well, if you like you can feel Rachels and then feel mine to compare.
neutral	Am I interrupting?
joy	Uh yes! Thank you.
neutral	Oh. Oh wait no.
neutral	Later.
non-neutral	No-no-dont! Dont leave me here with these people.
neutral	Oh uh, Im sorry.
fear	No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
neutral	Try feeding her again.
neutral	I already fed her.
non-neutral	I know, that's why I said again!
fear	Alright you guys, we can't turn on each other, Okay?   That's just what she wants.
neutral	Hey.
non-neutral	Phoebe! Rachel! Its Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.
sadness	Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
non-neutral	For what?
sadness	Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
neutral	And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
surprise	You al-you already had it?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
sadness	Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you dont have either.
sadness	We ruined everything.
sadness	Ugh
non-neutral	Well no, wait a minute, thats not true!
joy	No, what did, that was really sweet.
joy	And it kinda works out for the best.
surprise	What do you, what do you mean?
joy	Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!
joy	I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I dont even like!
non-neutral	Surprise
non-neutral	Sur-surprise.
neutral	Monica.
non-neutral	I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
neutral	Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.
neutral	Not you guys.
joy	You got it going on!
neutral	So, what are we gonna do today?
neutral	They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
non-neutral	Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
non-neutral	I don't think so!
neutral	Why not?
neutral	Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
non-neutral	I'm not always that bad!
neutral	Oh,
surprise	I punched you...?
surprise	And...?
surprise	... Phoebe...?
neutral	... and...?
non-neutral	I clunked your heads together!
sadness	Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
neutral	Oh, thats okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
neutral	Yeah.
surprise	Hey!
sadness	I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a fire.
surprise	What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?!
neutral	Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.
fear	All right. Did everyone get out okay?
neutral	Well, the giraffes okay. And so is the pirate.
surprise	Ohh. What is this?
fear	No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under there!!
non-neutral	Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey! How long until Petes fight?
neutral	Oh, about five minutes. Right now theyre interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
neutral	Hot dog?
fear	Four, please.  Im really nervous.  Thank you.
neutral	So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
neutral	What?
surprise	Oh!
joy	I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really terrific.
sadness	Ohh, thats too bad!
non-neutral	No, I-Im saying I liked her.
neutral	Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
non-neutral	Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again.
disgust	Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
neutral	Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?
neutral	Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
joy	Hey, the fights starting!
neutral	Okay, well be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
non-neutral	Nine times!
neutral	Okay, I had to put on lotion!
neutral	But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
neutral	Fights over!
neutral	Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesnt want to get married?
non-neutral	Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.
non-neutral	Hi guys!
neutral	Hey!
neutral	Hey!
neutral	What are you up too?
neutral	Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites.
neutral	Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
neutral	Yeah, Big Brother.
neutral	Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
neutral	Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
non-neutral	Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
neutral	Eh
sadness	Okay well thats good to know.
joy	The Mr. Bowmonts here!!!
joy	Oh thats great, my friend Joeys in the movie business.
neutral	Yknow who I ran into from school? Howie.
neutral	My friends name is Joey.
neutral	Apparently Howies editing now.
non-neutral	Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
surprise	Can you believe that?!
surprise	Yknow I-I-I havent spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
disgust	Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie.
disgust	No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
disgust	The nerve huh?
disgust	Yeah!
neutral	Refill?
non-neutral	Hey! How you doing?
joy	Good! Good, long time no see.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Like your sweater.
neutral	Oh hey, right back at ya.
surprise	Oh, its crazy about Rachel huh?
surprise	Yeah. SheWell, shes one crazy lady?
neutral	So whose is it?
neutral	Umm, I dont some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	He is so weird.
surprise	You wanna fool around with Joey?
joy	Yeah!
joy	You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't    get it out of my head!
surprise	And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
surprise	Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
neutral	Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
neutral	Who, who are they?
neutral	I know them from work.
surprise	Both of them?
neutral	No, one of them...
neutral	Which one?
neutral	I don't know, what were the names I just said?
non-neutral	Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
sadness	All right, all right, you're right
surprise	What the hell are you cooking!
surprise	Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
surprise	Fire alarm?  Oh! Hi, officerfireman, can-can I help you?
non-neutral	We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
non-neutral	Thats not mine.
non-neutral	Yes it is.
fear	How do you know?
disgust	The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, dont wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
anger	Okay do youOkay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
non-neutral	Please reattach this, its against the law to disconnect them.
non-neutral	Fine!  But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
neutral	Theres a reset button under the plastic cover.
surprise	Theres a reset button?!
joy	Ugh, thank you!
joy	Thank you!
surprise	Theres a reset button!
surprise	My God!
surprise	Why didnt I see that!
neutral	Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button?
joy	Oh here it is!
surprise	Oh!
joy	Ohh, God!
neutral	Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
anger	Ring dammit, ring!
neutral	Thanks.
surprise	Hey, you know our phone's not working?
surprise	What?!
neutral	I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
anger	I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
neutral	Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.
non-neutral	Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
anger	Nngghhh!!!!!!!
neutral	Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
neutral	"Heating device."
neutral	Radiator.
neutral	Five letters.
neutral	Rdtor.
surprise	Yeah, is Sidney there?  Oh, this is?  Sidney's a woman.
neutral	Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
neutral	Well, how long do you think it'll be?
neutral	Any minute now.
non-neutral	Hey, this-  Heyy...
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey! Any good mail?
neutral	Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild.
neutral	Ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, Im kinda.
neutral	"Benefits lapsed."
neutral	Hmm thats weird. I dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
neutral	Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year.
surprise	Let me see that!
neutral	All right.
surprise	Oh, I cant believe this!
anger	This sucks!
non-neutral	When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow?
non-neutral	And it wouldnt matter.
non-neutral	Now I gotta be careful?
non-neutral	!
non-neutral	Im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire.
non-neutral	All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see my agent.
neutral	Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
non-neutral	look both ways before you cross the street.
surprise	I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
joy	I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
neutral	Y'know what else I can't believe?
neutral	I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
neutral	Do you know anything about women?
neutral	No.
neutral	That's all right.
neutral	Okay.
joy	Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
joy	Yeah. He could row like a viking.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Mmm.
neutral	So how'd it go?
neutral	Oh, y'know..
neutral	Did he mention us?
sadness	He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
sadness	You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
joy	...love you.
neutral	Are you're hands still wet?
non-neutral	Uh, moist, yeah.
neutral	Let's dry 'em again.
non-neutral	Oh my God! Oh my God!!
surprise	Still crying?
neutral	Like a
neutral	Yknow, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
neutral	Whats the other one?
neutral	I dont know, Ive never had to use the other one.
neutral	Im just saying yknow, if were having sex, hes not gonna be talking.
non-neutral	Oh thats right.
neutral	Youre the talker.
joy	Anyway uh, great idea!
neutral	Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
neutral	Oh, we have some
non-neutral	No you dont!
neutral	Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up.
joy	Great!
neutral	Yeah, what town are we near?
neutral	Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
non-neutral	Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route were on?
neutral	Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
neutral	Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?
non-neutral	I dont know, Im sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?
neutral	Okay!
neutral	Yeah, no they dont do that.
non-neutral	Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
non-neutral	Who?
fear	I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?
neutral	I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
anger	No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
fear	But if...
anger	No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, youll have to think of something else.
joy	Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
non-neutral	So the going for help went well?
neutral	Im telling you man, I saw it.
anger	Yeah, well, youre wrong! Okay, youre wrong.
non-neutral	Im not wrong! I wish I was. Im sorry. Bet that barium enema doesnt sound so bad now, huh?
neutral	I know.
neutral	Lets try a lookof far offwonderment.
joy	Okay, well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and the days to come.
surprise	Chandler!
surprise	What is the matter with your face?!
non-neutral	I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!"
non-neutral	Hey!
anger	Dont laugh at him!
neutral	Hes
joy	Aww!
non-neutral	Thats it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
joy	Were gonna find love!
joy	Definitely!
neutral	Yeah, Im pretty confident about that.
joy	Thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
neutral	It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
neutral	What do you mean?
neutral	Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.
neutral	You mean a backup?
joy	Exactly!
neutral	Yeah, yeah I got that.
neutral	You do?
neutral	Hm-mmm.
neutral	Who?
neutral	Joey.
surprise	Joey?!
joy	Yeah!
surprise	Are you serious?!
non-neutral	Yeah, I locked him years ago!
surprise	Wh So If neither of you are married by the time youre 40, youre gonna marry Joey.
neutral	Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
surprise	Oh, seriously?
neutral	Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
neutral	Yeah, Im sorry man.  You wanna go watch?
joy	Yeah!
neutral	Good morning.
non-neutral	Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
joy	Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
non-neutral	Ohh thats nice.
joy	Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
disgust	Wo-women? You mean like old women?
neutral	Well kinda old, like 30.
neutral	Oh.
surprise	And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
surprise	Thats great! Wow man, so Joey mustve really taught you some stuff huh?
neutral	A little.
surprise	Yeah?
neutral	How you doin?
joy	Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
neutral	I know.
non-neutral	So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
surprise	What did you just say?
joy	You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
surprise	Are you serious?!
joy	Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
joy	I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
joy	Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!
joy	Whoa!
non-neutral	Where have I heard that before?
neutral	Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas.
neutral	I guess it must've been some movie I saw.
neutral	What do you say?
joy	Okay!
joy	Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
non-neutral	Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
neutral	It went under the table.
non-neutral	Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
joy	All right!
joy	Here it is! Here it is!
neutral	That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
neutral	It's a four.
neutral	I think so too.
joy	Well thats it. Im done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats.
joy	Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you.
neutral	Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
neutral	Is there anything we can do for you?
neutral	No just, nobody press on my stomach.
neutral	You can keep those pants by the way.
surprise	Whoaheywh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
neutral	Yeah, you want some?
joy	Ah, just cut me a little sliver.
neutral	A little bigger.
neutral	Little bigger.
surprise	What?!
non-neutral	Are you afraid youre gonna run out?!
anger	Cut me a real piece!
surprise	Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
neutral	I need to talk to you, its pretty urgent. Its about Monica and Chandler.
surprise	Oh my God!
neutral	Of course, of course.
neutral	Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?
neutral	Umm, do you know each others hometowns?
non-neutral	Why dont you   Wh-whats going on?
neutral	Well, umm, not much.
neutral	But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow?
neutral	So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
neutral	Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler?
neutral	NothingWhy?!
anger	Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
neutral	Oh yeah it is! Im going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
anger	Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
neutral	Oh, Im sorry. Im so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
non-neutral	Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this.
fear	Okay,  I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life without you.
sadness	Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.
sadness	Your good heart Rach,  and, and....
neutral	No.
sadness	I cant, youre a totally different person to me now.
sadness	I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.
non-neutral	God, and now I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant,  it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.
sadness	Its just changed, everything.
sadness	Forever.
non-neutral	Yeah, but this cant be it, I mean.
sadness	Then how come it is?
neutral	Windows are clean, candels are lit.
non-neutral	Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt.
neutral	Did I turn the fish?
neutral	No, cause I made lasagne.
non-neutral	Am I out of control?
neutral	Just a touch.
non-neutral	Mon, I don't understand.
surprise	I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms?
surprise	I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
neutral	What?
non-neutral	Could tonight be the Night?
neutral	I don't know.
non-neutral	Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know.

neutral	But that's okay, no problem.
neutral	No problem.
non-neutral	Hmm, noodle soup.

surprise	What-what?
surprise	Ow! Ow! Contraction.  Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
neutral	Would you like to see a semi-private room?
neutral	Yeah, it couldnt hurt to look.
neutral	I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
non-neutral	That's funny. Who are they?
neutral	The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
surprise	You mean they're lovers.
neutral	If you wanna put a label on it.
surprise	Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
non-neutral	Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.

anger	Phoebe!
non-neutral	Its not here.
neutral	Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why dont you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
neutral	How could I have left them in the copy room?
anger	I dont know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? Its not a perfect world! Just go please.
anger	Fine.
non-neutral	Thank you.  Hello?  I still dont get it.
joy	How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!

surprise	Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean youre going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
neutral	Well, hes very charming.

joy	Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
surprise	Oh Im sorry! Do you need a break?

non-neutral	Come on more!
non-neutral	Oh God!
neutral	Yeah, you like that dont you?
joy	Oh yeah right there!
joy	You want it there? You take it there baby!
non-neutral	Uh Phoebe?
non-neutral	Yeah, say my name. Say it!  And now Im going to cover you back up, and umm were never doing this again.
anger	Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy?
anger	Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be!

surprise	What the hell is in there?
non-neutral	It's just my knitting that's all!  Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
neutral	There will come a time in each of your careers when youll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.
neutral	I had such an opportunity in the recent, present.
non-neutral	And Im ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually.
anger	Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him.
non-neutral	And now, hes got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me Im stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV.

neutral	Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
joy	Hi! Hi, Im Ross, you dont know me, but Im a big, big fan of yours. I mean,
neutral	Arent you with that girl over there?
neutral	Well, yeah, kinda.
neutral	Um, but thats okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so Im allowed to sleep with you.
non-neutral	No, no, no, its flattery.
non-neutral	Im sorry.
non-neutral	Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella.
fear	Dont, dont just dismiss this so fast.
neutral	I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...

neutral	May I see it?
fear	Um, no.
non-neutral	Come on!

surprise	Im not on the list!
neutral	Um, see, but thats not the final draft.
non-neutral	Its laminated!
neutral	Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
neutral	Y'know its ironic...
neutral	What?
neutral	...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
neutral	Were just gonna be friends.
non-neutral	Get out of here you lurker!  Go on! Get!
joy	Hey Pheebs!
surprise	Ohh! You made up!
neutral	Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.

neutral	Well, yknow its none of my business, but arent you married?
non-neutral	Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Yknow I just wish we could be like on a break!
non-neutral	Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
neutral	So thats the only reason she could be here huh?
neutral	It couldnt have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe Im a good listener and I uh I put on a
non-neutral	Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
neutral	Yknow what?
neutral	I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to you later.
neutral	Good-bye.
surprise	Whoa!
neutral	Uh, that was your sister actually.
neutral	She-she thinks that youre just using me.
neutral	So?
sadness	Im sorry.
surprise	What are you doing here?!
neutral	I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Umm, okay, okay, look.
non-neutral	I took this picture from your fridge.
non-neutral	Okay, because I know that this is my Father.
non-neutral	Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.
anger	Now, look I deserve to know where I came from.
non-neutral	All right?
anger	So if you can help me find my Father then you should!
anger	Otherwise, youre just mean!
anger	So, just tell me the truth!
non-neutral	All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
surprise	My Father is Chuck Magioni?
neutral	No, no, thats just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!
sadness	And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats the truth.
sadness	Oh.
neutral	But umm, youre right.
neutral	I think that a person should know where they come from.
neutral	Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay.
neutral	Im your mother.
surprise	Heh?
sadness	Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
surprise	Whats happening to your accent?
surprise	Come again?
non-neutral	Whats-whats this nonsense?
sadness	All right, Im-Im not English.
neutral	Im from Long Island.
non-neutral	I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.
sadness	Im sorry.
non-neutral	So, if we could just get back to the lecture.
neutral	Umm, were there any questions?
neutral	About paleontology.
non-neutral	All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.
non-neutral	Obviously, I screwed up.
non-neutral	But what you guys think of me is really important because Im-Im hoping to get a permanent job here.
non-neutral	So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
non-neutral	Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am
non-neutral	Well, hello Rachel!
neutral	Where you going, Joe?
neutral	For a walk.
non-neutral	Oh. You mind if I join you?
neutral	Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.
surprise	Your thoughts? Plural?
joy	Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!
neutral	I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
non-neutral	Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??
non-neutral	You guys are killing me!
non-neutral	She's forbidden fruit!
non-neutral	It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?
neutral	Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?
neutral	Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
non-neutral	Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
surprise	Great novels?
neutral	Fine ... mediocre porn
neutral	Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office.
neutral	Now, he doesnt get in until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
non-neutral	Thats kinda sad.
neutral	Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,
joy	Got it!
joy	Lets roll!
neutral	Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
neutral	Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anythingminute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan.
neutral	Uh actually, Id like to speak with both of you.
neutral	Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
neutral	Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
neutral	Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
non-neutral	Oh! No problem! I
surprise	What?
neutral	You are iron.
joy	You are steel!
non-neutral	Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
neutral	I told you, were adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
surprise	I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
neutral	Look, you and I went to different high schools...
neutral	Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school.
neutral	You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.
non-neutral	I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
surprise	They had to have that specially made?!
neutral	It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
surprise	Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
surprise	Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out.
joy	And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.
neutral	I-I owe her this.
neutral	I never let her eat.
neutral	Oh, you go out with him.
surprise	Oh, really?!
neutral	Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
neutral	Ill try.
neutral	Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that youre dancing with.
neutral	Yeah, yeah, okay.
non-neutral	Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown  Im trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
anger	Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, shes real, uh, mellow!
neutral	Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know
anger	Ross, get over it! Its not like she hates you.
sadness	Yeah but
neutral	Ross, shes not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
non-neutral	Huh. Yknow whats not one of a kind? A twin!
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	Hey!
joy	Ooh, Phoebes here! Okay, lets turn out all the lights and well just watch the movie!
joy	Okay. HeyOoh, cool sheets!
joy	Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
joy	Sure!
non-neutral	He got it a flea market!
disgust	You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
neutral	And Joey?
neutral	How do you think she's doing?
surprise	Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
surprise	Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
joy	Thank you!
neutral	Now that Rachel's gone?
non-neutral	So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
non-neutral	Oh, god help us.
surprise	What?
disgust	Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
disgust	Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
non-neutral	What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
sadness	I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
joy	So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
joy	Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
neutral	Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
surprise	What do you mean?
sadness	Carol our sex life isits just not working
joy	Hey there little fella!
neutral	Hey, uh-hey, why dont we get some shoes on ya, huh?
joy	Hey, why dont you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room!
joy	Yay!
surprise	!
joy	Yay!
joy	Yay!
non-neutral	Seriously, our sex life I was thinking, maybe I dont know, we could try some-some new things.
neutral	Yknow?
neutral	For fun?
surprise	Like what?
non-neutral	Well I dont know umm,  what if we were too tie each other up?
neutral	Umm, some people eat stuff off one another.
disgust	Nah!
neutral	Umm, yknow we-we could try dirty talk?
neutral	Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
joy	I love that idea!
joy	Hey, Sophie!
non-neutral	So whos idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
anger	Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
surprise	Oh my God, they took my idea!
surprise	That was you?!
non-neutral	Yeah! Okay, here you go.

neutral	Yes, but, Ross you
non-neutral	What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
sadness	Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
surprise	Why would we do that?
sadness	Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
neutral	Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
non-neutral	Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
surprise	The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
neutral	The balloon?
neutral	No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached

non-neutral	Hi uh, Im Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect Id like to donate some fluids.
neutral	Were actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so were not looking for applicants right now.
sadness	Oh thats too bad. Ive kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure theres no studies I can participate in?
neutral	Well, heres a schedule of whats coming up.
neutral	Thanks.  Well but this one starts now.

non-neutral	We already got the results back on that on, and theyre not good.
neutral	Hey! Hows it goin?
neutral	Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
joy	Yes it has! I made cookies!

non-neutral	But you should eat them now because theyre hot from the oven.
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	Oh-ho! But not in here! Cant eat em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
neutral	Okay, Ill be out in a second.
neutral	Okay!
neutral	What are you doing?

neutral	Me too, we should get goin'.
neutral	No.
neutral	Oh. Mine does.
neutral	Okay, here comes another camera.

neutral	Theyve been taping those people up there all day.
neutral	Right.
non-neutral	Hey, whatd you guys do to get up on there?
non-neutral	Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
joy	Yeah!

neutral	Thats it, feel the rhythm. Thats better.
neutral	Uh-huh.
non-neutral	Okay, youre dancing with that girl over there.

surprise	My son? Pretty serious.  Oh hey Katie!  What uh, what are you doing here?
neutral	Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this.
neutral	Ah, mustve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
neutral	Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.
neutral	Oh.
fear	Oh uhI actually came here to ask you out.
joy	Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. Im just gonna put this  back in my pocket, pretend

neutral	Well, like father, like son.
joy	Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
surprise	Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
non-neutral	Well, y'know, possibly.  You didnt tell him that, though? Right?
neutral	Ummmmmmmm, no.
non-neutral	You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell the guy that!
non-neutral	Why not?! Id be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to getoh I see.
non-neutral	Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea.
non-neutral	Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
neutral	Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
surprise	Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
surprise	Instead of...?
neutral	That's right.
neutral	Never had that dream.
neutral	No.
neutral	All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
surprise	And they weren't looking at you before?!
neutral	Finally, I figure I'd better answer it,
joy	Honey! Dinners ready!
joy	Whats my little chef got for me tonight?
joy	Your favorite!
joy	Ho-ho-ho,  fried stuff with cheese!
joy	Yep! And lots of it!
joy	Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here.  Okay.
joy	Okay, in we go.
joy	Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!  How you doin?
neutral	Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate.
non-neutral	So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is.
neutral	Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
surprise	Oh my god.
surprise	What?
non-neutral	Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
neutral	Come on, they're close.
disgust	Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
neutral	Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
disgust	Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
neutral	Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
disgust	Oh my god, what were you thinking?
neutral	All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
surprise	Oh!
surprise	Ow!
disgust	I'm outta here.
neutral	Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
surprise	Really?
neutral	Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
joy	Hello! One marriage please!
joy	Yep, we wanna get married!
neutral	All right.
joy	Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!

neutral	Are you sure you wanna do this?
joy	Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
joy	Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
neutral	Wait!  Okay!

surprise	Yes.  Youre not asking are you?
neutral	No.
joy	Yes! Totally!
joy	Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
joy	Youarenot going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
surprise	He asked you out?!
non-neutral	No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
joy	Saucy!
neutral	What are these?
neutral	Electrical plans for the building.
fear	Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
neutral	I know that switch does something, okay?
neutral	So-so I went down to city hall and got these.

surprise	Wow! If only more people knew.
neutral	Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in
neutral	Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.

neutral	Bye!
neutral	Bye!
sadness	Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.
disgust	Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
surprise	Actually, I did!
neutral	Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
surprise	Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
surprise	Are you serious?
non-neutral	Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
non-neutral	Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsShe knows!
fear	Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
neutral	All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
neutral	No, let's just leave the lights on.
surprise	Oh my God!
non-neutral	You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
neutral	Oh fine.
joy	Ready?  Wrestle!
neutral	Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
neutral	All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
fear	Can we please focus here, a naked mans life hangs in the balance!
non-neutral	Im telling you hes dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
neutral	All right, ladies and gentlemen, lets poke.
neutral	Steady.
neutral	Steady.
neutral	Okay, a little higher.
neutral	Careful of the angle.
neutral	Okay, okay, were approaching the window  Thread the needle.
neutral	Thread the needle.
joy	Hes alive! Hes a-live!!!
disgust	And yet, were still poking him.
neutral	Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
non-neutral	He does not look happy.
surprise	Hey-hey, now hes showing us his poking device.
non-neutral	Hey, thats never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
non-neutral	Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other.
disgust	Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard.
surprise	Oh God oh!
surprise	Contraction!
neutral	Yeah? Okay.
surprise	Ooh! Ow!!
non-neutral	Are you looking at her?!
anger	No!
anger	Dont you look at her you sick bastard!
fear	Honey I swear! I wasnt looking at her!
anger	Shes in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!
neutral	Umm. Umm, Im-Im just gonna
anger	See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!
non-neutral	No-no, ImIm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.
neutral	You miss your girlfriend?
neutral	Just ignore them.
neutral	Ross.
non-neutral	What? What?
neutral	Hes looking at me.

joy	Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, whos ass I cannot kick.
joy	Say it!
joy	Say we are unagi!
non-neutral	Its not something you are! Its something you have!
joy	Say it!
non-neutral	Yknow what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
neutral	Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
neutral	Yeah, it's in there.
surprise	Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
neutral	Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
surprise	Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
surprise	Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
neutral	Yes. Yes.
surprise	You?!  And-and you?!
joy	Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
surprise	How?! When?!
neutral	It happened in London.
surprise	IN LONDON!!!
neutral	The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
non-neutral	But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
fear	No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
fear	Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
non-neutral	All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's
joy	I know, it's great!
disgust	Aww, I don't want to see that!
non-neutral	We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
neutral	And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
neutral	Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
neutral	No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
neutral	Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
surprise	Ahh!
fear	What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
neutral	Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
surprise	Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
neutral	You got a better idea?
neutral	All right, call it in the air.
neutral	Heads.
neutral	Heads it is.
joy	Yes! Whew!
neutral	We have to assign heads to something.
neutral	Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
non-neutral	What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
neutral	Okay, some tricks of the trade.
neutral	Now, Ive never been able to cry as an actor, so if Im in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling.
neutral	Or ah, or, lets say I wanna convey that Ive just done something evil.
neutral	That would be the basic I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it  Okay, lets say Ive just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.
neutral	And thats how its done.
joy	Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
neutral	Hey, Mr. Trib.
non-neutral	Hey-hey.
neutral	Then Im gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
surprise	Who are you?
neutral	Hi, Im Eric, Im gonna be Chandlers new roommate.
surprise	Im Chandlers new roommate.
surprise	I-I-I dont think so.
surprise	I could be Chandlers new roommate.
surprise	But, he told me over the phone.
neutral	He told me in person.
surprise	Thats weird.
joy	Well, Im going to go into my new apartment now.  Ehh!
surprise	Hey! Look who I found!
joy	Oh, hey guys!
neutral	Yknow, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
neutral	Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
neutral	Or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas?
non-neutral	No!
neutral	Didnt think so!
neutral	Okay, cmon guys, show us where the presents are!
non-neutral	Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thats as good as garbage?
neutral	Hmm, how about my azzz?
neutral	Hey, this is hollow.
surprise	What?
surprise	This bench, its hollow! I cant believe I never knew that!  Oh, the presents!!!
fear	No, dont look directly at them!
surprise	What?
neutral	Alright, no, we could look at them!
neutral	I
non-neutral	Hi! Im so glad youre here, but its gonna be a while. I-I wished youd called first.
neutral	Oh thats all right, Im coming back later with your father.
non-neutral	Oh good.
neutral	I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
neutral	Okay, whats up?

surprise	Ma, youre asking me to marry you?
joy	This is your grandmothers engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
surprise	Mom no, come on! Thank you.
fear	Just hear me out!
sadness	Maybe this wouldve happened if Id been more nurturing, or Id paid more attention, or I... had a uterus.
non-neutral	I cant believe this!
sadness	I know no, no, y'know you dont deserve this, you dont Ross.
sadness	Youre, youre really, youre so good.

neutral	Did you hear that?!
non-neutral	I dont need you guys to care about me!
joy	Because the universe cares!
joy	The whole universe!
sadness	I really wished theyd care just a little bit though.
neutral	Yknow, I dont-I dont think its you.
fear	This is a freaky place.
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	Guys!
neutral	Oh no, its you.
neutral	Yeah.
joy	I like this one.  It seems to say, "I love you and thats why I have to kill you."
joy	They cant all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
surprise	Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?

anger	Im not getting into this again!
non-neutral	Okay! Oh God, yknow what? Its really bad.
anger	Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.
non-neutral	This doesnt mean anything, does it?
anger	Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! Right?
neutral	That is true.
non-neutral	Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
neutral	Oh, Ive been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
neutral	Joey, you know you dont actually have one.
non-neutral	Come on! What are you doing?! Im in character! Would you talk to her!
non-neutral	Ahh, I think it just moved. Its really poking me.
non-neutral	All right, thats it, were going to the emergency room.
non-neutral	What?! No, you cant, you cant leave me here with them! Were baby-sitting!
non-neutral	The babies are asleep, Im sure youll be okay on your own for a while!

non-neutral	Hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got to go to the hospital.
neutral	But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
neutral	I think thats gum.
neutral	Im pretty sure its gun.
non-neutral	Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go.
non-neutral	A real man wouldnt just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?
neutral	That was the only way I could get him to
neutral	Hi! How are the Gellers?
anger	Dont call us that!
anger	The judge wouldnt let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
non-neutral	Hey! Its Porsche!!
joy	Hey sweetie!
joy	Hey!
surprise	Theres no back to this couch!
surprise	Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
neutral	Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yknow?
neutral	Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think I was yknow, all dead inside.
joy	Oh thats so sweet! Look Chandler I dont care if you cant cry, I love you.
neutral	Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
non-neutral	Stop it!
neutral	No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, were up at the altar and Im like this.
neutral	I wont care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
neutral	Yeah?
non-neutral	Of course he is!
non-neutral	What, do you think Id just use my son as-as an excuse?
anger	What kind of father do you think I am?
neutral	All right, sorry.
neutral	I gotta go make a fake Ben.
surprise	The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
neutral	Well, either that or uh
non-neutral	Joey!!
neutral	Yeah?
non-neutral	Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
non-neutral	Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!

joy	You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
surprise	Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
neutral	Huh. That's nice.
neutral	and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve just lasted just one day, burned for
neutral	Eight whole days.
joy	Thats right, and thats why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
joy	Awesome!
surprise	Yeah?
neutral	My favorite part was when
neutral	The Armadillo was actually not so
joy	Hey!
neutral	Oh.

surprise	Wow! Thats exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
neutral	What?
surprise	Im just saying, this woman, I mean shes fictitious. No?
non-neutral	Why would you say that?
neutral	Cause youre still into Monica.
neutral	So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
non-neutral	Youre good. Youre good!
neutral	Yeah, no, Im fairly intuitive and psychic. Its a substantial gift.
fear	Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though?
neutral	Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
non-neutral	Thanks a lot.
neutral	No Im serious. I mean Im intuitive, but my memory sucks.
neutral	Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
anger	For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
neutral	Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
joy	Oh, thanks, sweetie.

surprise	Do I know you?
surprise	Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?

disgust	Do you have any respect for your body?
disgust	Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
anger	Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.
neutral	The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
neutral	Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
surprise	Really?
surprise	He does?
joy	Hey, buddy, what's up!
surprise	Oh, she told you about that, huh.

neutral	Hey, Frank.
neutral	Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didnt.
neutral	Theres someone here who can explain this better than I can.
neutral	Hi Frank.
neutral	Hi, Mrs. Knight.
neutral	Phoebes right Frank.
neutral	I know its hard to hear, but it wouldve been wrong to go through with it.
sadness	I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not.
non-neutral	Is that it, is that what it is?
neutral	Yeah, but not just that.
sadness	Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less
neutral	None the less.
sadness	None the less. Umm, youre too young to, to really know what you want.
neutral	Thats right, exactly.
non-neutral	All right, its a good bye kiss, thats good.
neutral	Bye-bye.
non-neutral	Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what Im saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong.
non-neutral	Okay, Ive decided Im gonna let this happen!
neutral	Okay, can I just get my purse?
neutral	Okay, all right, good.
neutral	.
surprise	Oh, look look look.
neutral	The last candle's about to burn out.
neutral	10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
neutral	Thank you.
neutral	Thanks.
fear	Kinda... spooky without any lights.
joy	Bwah-hah-hah!
non-neutral	OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
neutral	Oh.. oh... oh.
neutral	Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
neutral	All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
joy	You blew them away!
joy	Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!
neutral	I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?
surprise	I was
joy	No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
surprise	Oh my God!  I'm your
non-neutral	I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
non-neutral	Look, I took it too far!
neutral	Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
neutral	Could've played
neutral	Thanks.
neutral	Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
neutral	Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the
neutral	Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
neutral	Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.
surprise	Nooo!
neutral	Hello?
neutral	Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.
non-neutral	Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
neutral	Green. To the green.
neutral	I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind.
neutral	To the left, to the left- aww!
neutral	Ohhh... I'm fine.
joy	Hey!
non-neutral	Please tell me you got the message!
neutral	What message?
neutral	The actor playing Mac couldnt do it, they needed to see you at 2 oclock.
surprise	What?! Its 6 oclock!
fear	Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!
non-neutral	I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya!
neutral	I went to Rosss!
neutral	I went to the coffeehouse!
neutral	I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
neutral	Thats the day youre gonna die? Seedarnit, Ive got shuffleboard that day.
neutral	Thats what you think.
neutral	Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers? Wouldnt they have the recipe?
neutral	Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
neutral	What was her name?
neutral	Nesele Toulouse.
neutral	Nestle Tollhouse
neutral	Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
neutral	(grabbing a bag of
non-neutral	Yes!!  Oh.
non-neutral	I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
non-neutral	I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!!
neutral	So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
joy	Absolutely!
joy	I am so on board!
non-neutral	Rachel didn't you just light that?
neutral	Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.
neutral	I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
disgust	Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
neutral	Tell me about it!
joy	Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
neutral	It does sound appealing.
non-neutral	Oh, I never could do it.
neutral	Oh but you could.
neutral	You can.
joy	Absolutely!
joy	We can help each other out!
neutral	We can get--what are those--those patches!
joy	We could be like the Patch Sisters!
joy	Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
joy	Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
sadness	My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.
non-neutral	Okay then!
non-neutral	I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
neutral	Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
neutral	Does, um, anyone wanna see?
non-neutral	Nooo!
anger	Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
disgust	It's worse than the thumb!
anger	Hey, this is so unfair!
surprise	Oh, why is it unfair?
non-neutral	So I have a flaw!
anger	Big deal!
non-neutral	Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?
non-neutral	And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?
non-neutral	And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?
disgust	I mean, what the hell is that thing?
non-neutral	...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
non-neutral	...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
neutral	Well, I-I could live without it.
non-neutral	Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
neutral	Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
anger	Oh,  "you do, do you"?
neutral	You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
non-neutral	"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
neutral	Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
anger	Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
sadness	Awww! Mel Torme died.
neutral	Joey, that papers like a year old!
sadness	Aw! Does that mean the
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
neutral	Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
neutral	Probably?
disgust	Yeah, I don't like that word.
neutral	Kind of what probably really means.
neutral	Yeah, uh-huh.
non-neutral	Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow?
non-neutral	I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!"
neutral	Yknow?
neutral	You gotta take care of yourselves!
neutral	In
neutral	Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
joy	Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
joy	Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesnt he?
neutral	Hes a keeper. How are you feeling?
neutral	Oh, Im fine.
neutral	Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her all alone.
neutral	Oh, Im not doing it alone. I have Ross.
neutral	Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
neutral	Well then he gets a divorce, its Ross!
neutral	Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family.
non-neutral	Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.
disgust	Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
neutral	Hey. Whos that?
neutral	New people.
neutral	What happened to the Disgustingtons?
non-neutral	Theyre having their baby!
anger	Its not fair Ross we got here first!
neutral	Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.
neutral	Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
surprise	Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
neutral	Phoebe?
neutral	Yeah?
surprise	Look at that guy by the window, wow!
neutral	Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.
sadness	Oh, what is wrong with me lately?
neutral	I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here.
non-neutral	Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
neutral	Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
surprise	Really?! So this has happened to you?
neutral	Oh absolutely yeah!
neutral	Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
non-neutral	Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap.
neutral	Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a
disgust	Ugh!
fear	I dont know what Im going to do!
anger	I called the company that sent and th-they dont care!
non-neutral	Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is?
joy	Hey guys!
joy	Hey!
neutral	Hey
joy	I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!
joy	And the guys from work had a blast.
non-neutral	Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
non-neutral	Yeah!
surprise	And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
non-neutral	So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice!
non-neutral	Yeah, right!
neutral	I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those
surprise	That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
surprise	So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
joy	Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
non-neutral	So you might say, its a magic ring.
surprise	OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!
neutral	Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
neutral	Obviously! So, how do we decide?
neutral	Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should date her
neutral	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
non-neutral	Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her
neutral	Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
neutral	Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
neutral	Yeah well we should order some food then.
non-neutral	No Joey! Look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, well
neutral	That sounds fair.
neutral	Maybe Ill take her to that new French restaurant down the street
non-neutral	Ah yeahwait a second now!
neutral	Look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.
non-neutral	I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
neutral	Well sorry, thats what I do on dates.
neutral	All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates.
neutral	So lets decide on the spending limit
neutral	Yeah. Uh, a slicesix dollars?
neutral	I was thinking more like a hundred.
neutral	Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
neutral	Hi, again.
neutral	Hey!
neutral	Hey!
joy	Thank you soo, much.
anger	Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
neutral	You want some help with that?
neutral	Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I dont!
surprise	Whoa! Are you okay?
surprise	Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
neutral	Its the heat.  And-and the humidity.
neutral	Thats a uh, thats a tough combination.
neutral	Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
surprise	Like you wouldnt believe.  Wow! This is a great place.
neutral	What do you mean?
neutral	Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
surprise	Oh!
neutral	Hey, somebody left their keys.
surprise	Ooohh, to a Porsche!
surprise	Transcribers note: Oh come on!
surprise	Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind?
neutral	If I had a Porsche, Id have the keys surgically attached to my hand!
neutral	Hey Gunther, these yours?
disgust	Yeah, thats what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
neutral	Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?
neutral	Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found?
surprise	Theres a lost and found?  My shoe!
surprise	You left a shoe here?!
neutral	Well, I didnt realize until I got home.
neutral	I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!
neutral	Yknow what?
neutral	Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.
neutral	Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe.
joy	Great! Thanks.
neutral	Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
non-neutral	Carol, we've been through this before, ok?
joy	We have a good time.
joy	We laugh, we play.
joy	It's like we're father and son.
joy	Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
joy	Oh, this is so cute.
neutral	Oh, I got that for him.
joy	My mommies love me. That's clever.
neutral	Hello?
neutral	Oh, Hi, JuHi, Jew!
neutral	Uh huh?
neutral	Uh huh?
neutral	Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great.
neutral	See ya then.
neutral	Bye.
surprise	Did you just say Hi, Jew?
neutral	Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
non-neutral	Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes!
joy	Thanks Monica!
disgust	Does that smell bother you?
surprise	What the smell from Joeys? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
neutral	Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie to cover it.
non-neutral	I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
joy	Okay!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  Its for you. Its the fire inspector.
surprise	Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!
non-neutral	Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair straightener that started the fire.
neutral	No-no, it was the candles.
non-neutral	Its very not good leaving candles unattended.
neutral	In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay.
neutral	Well, I have to go now.
surprise	Joey proposed to me.
surprise	Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!
fear	Well, I-I said yes.
surprise	What?!
non-neutral	Are you crazy?
non-neutral	You just had Ross's baby!
non-neutral	It's-it's so  inappropriate.
disgust	No, it's worse than that.
disgust	It's wrong.
surprise	It's… It is bigger than  mine!
neutral	I know.
non-neutral	You can't marry him!
non-neutral	Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.
neutral	Well do you love him?
neutral	Sure.
non-neutral	Sure?
neutral	Yeah, I mean whatever.
non-neutral	Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?
non-neutral	No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
neutral	So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
non-neutral	Here comes the bride.
surprise	Oh my God Monica!
joy	I wanna wear this everyday.
joy	You look so beautiful.
joy	Im so happy for me.
neutral	Hello?
non-neutral	Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
neutral	Yeah, we got him back. Everythings fine.
anger	Damnit!
neutral	Uh, yknow what?
anger	Ill tell you who it hurts!
anger	It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principals office wearing nothing but a catchers mitt!
neutral	That was
anger	I will be! Listen, I dont want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
neutral	Fine.
non-neutral	Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.
non-neutral	And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want!
neutral	No thats not what I want. Uh, Im glad you guys were bonding but I
non-neutral	Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff!
non-neutral	And I havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway!
anger	Crap!!
neutral	I gotta go!
surprise	Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
neutral	No.
surprise	Me neither! We have to get in!
neutral	Just act like you belong.
surprise	Oh my God! Oranges!
neutral	Shh!  Nice to see you again.
neutral	Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
neutral	Yes, of course.
neutral	Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see the seat number.
neutral	Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A.
non-neutral	Okay.  Mrs. Green! Okay Im really sorry!! Im apologizing for the  Okay, I bit my tongue, but Im
joy	Hey! Look whos back! Its the birthday girl! Hows the birthday girl feeling?
non-neutral	Well, I feel fine, but I think youre bumming out the rest of the kids.
surprise	What?
non-neutral	Okay!
neutral	Yknow what?
non-neutral	I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.
neutral	All I really needed was a plan.
neutral	See I wanna have three kids
non-neutral	Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
neutral	As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time Im 35 which gives me five years.
joy	I love this plan!
joy	I wanna marry this plan!
non-neutral	You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed!
non-neutral	Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,
non-neutral	Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too yknow!
non-neutral	Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
neutral	I dont know.
disgust	Why am I not surprised?
anger	Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this!
neutral	I dont think you have much choice.
anger	Well well see!
neutral	Bye-bye!
neutral	Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?
neutral	Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .
neutral	Dad?
neutral	Im here!
surprise	Hey!
non-neutral	Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
sadness	Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.
neutral	Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
neutral	Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
sadness	Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.
joy	Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of the memories
neutral	Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven
neutral	I used to
neutral	Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
neutral	Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a
neutral	Ok, got the vent open.
joy	Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
neutral	Ben, you ready?
neutral	All right, gimme your foot.
neutral	Ok, on three, Ben.
neutral	One, two, three.
neutral	Ok, That's it, Ben.
neutral	What do you see?
neutral	Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
surprise	Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
surprise	Wait! You forgot your legs!
joy	You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
joy	Thank you.
neutral	Filing system?
surprise	Oh-oh!
neutral	You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?
joy	It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
neutral	Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
neutral	I notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
joy	Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
joy	Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost
neutral	I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
non-neutral	Oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!
neutral	Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
neutral	Yes, I realize that
neutral	And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
joy	I love working with designers!
neutral	With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?
neutral	Chandler, you have an assistant right?
fear	Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
neutral	Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
surprise	I do?
neutral	Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Or not.
neutral	Where's Chandler?
neutral	Here I am.
disgust	Wash your hands!!!
surprise	How did youknow?
surprise	Hey! What's she doing back here?
neutral	Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
neutral	Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
surprise	What happened in Atlantic City?!
neutral	Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
non-neutral	Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
neutral	And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?
neutral	So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.
non-neutral	Now, I know what youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls.
surprise	You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
non-neutral	In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
joy	Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
non-neutral	Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
neutral	Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
neutral	So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
non-neutral	Of course I am!
neutral	Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot.
neutral	Ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.
neutral	And-and then guess what?
non-neutral	The babys coming and I dont know what to do.
non-neutral	Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
neutral	No. Sweetie, youre gonna be fine.
non-neutral	Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
neutral	Im going to the bathroom.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay.
neutral	It
joy	Hey!
non-neutral	Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
neutral	I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
neutral	Not if you were here.
neutral	Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
joy	Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope its you!
neutral	I hope its you.
joy	Me too!
non-neutral	First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so important to me
non-neutral	Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
neutral	Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.
neutral	Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine
joy	Yes!!! Oh!!
non-neutral	Hypothetically!
neutral	Still.
neutral	If Phoebe were my maid of honor
neutral	Uh-hmm.
neutral	Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
neutral	Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.
neutral	Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours?
neutral	Well thats the best part. Umm,
surprise	Wh-why is that the best part?
joy	Because then I dont have to!
neutral	Well of
non-neutral	Im really not deciding!
non-neutral	Fine!
neutral	Yeah thats right.
joy	Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!
neutral	If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?
neutral	It's not just the drum noise.
non-neutral	Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye!
non-neutral	Oh god, my eye!"
non-neutral	I mean, it is so annoying.
neutral	Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
surprise	Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
neutral	Maybe on some level.
surprise	Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
neutral	No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you.
joy	Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you.
joy	And, a brownie!
neutral	Well, half a brownie.
neutral	Actually, its just bag.
neutral	Its been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin to feel faint so
joy	Oh man!
joy	This is so great!
joy	I actually feel like Im going on a real date!
neutral	Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and Im wearing underwear that goes up to aboutthere.
non-neutral	Hey come on now, this is a real date.
neutral	Uh, sonice place you got here.
surprise	Foosball, huh?
neutral	Pizza box.
surprise	Oh, a subscription to
neutral	Yeah, actually thats my roommates.
neutral	I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
neutral	Ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch yourself.
non-neutral	Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking?
neutral	Hm-mmm.
neutral	Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
neutral	Yeah, but Im pretty sure hes gay.
non-neutral	No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
anger	Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
neutral	Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.

non-neutral	I cant believe we have to stop seeing each other.
non-neutral	For what its worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
neutral	I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we cant date. Its against the rules. Its forbidden.

neutral	So, um, what do you do for a living?
neutral	Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
neutral	Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
sadness	I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
neutral	Now that is funny.
neutral	Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?
sadness	'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
neutral	I guess.

joy	Let's try scooching!
neutral	Come on.
neutral	Come on.
neutral	Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.
neutral	Carol, Kristin.
neutral	Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.
non-neutral	And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	All right.
neutral	When I was six years old.
neutral	Hm-mmm.
neutral	I wanted a big wheel.
non-neutral	And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.

neutral	See?
joy	I already feel like I know you a little better!
joy	Thank you.
neutral	Okay, come on.

surprise	Oh!
anger	Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
surprise	That's patio furniture!
neutral	So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
neutral	What about the birds?
neutral	I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
neutral	You pick one.
neutral	All right, how about the ladybugs?
non-neutral	Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
non-neutral	Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
non-neutral	Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!
neutral	Bijan for men?
neutral	Bijan for men?
neutral	Bijan for...   Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
neutral	Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
neutral	Ready, Annabelle?
neutral	You bet.  Maybe some other time?
sadness	Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?!

sadness	What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
non-neutral	Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
non-neutral	Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while?
non-neutral	Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
neutral	Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
neutral	Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
neutral	Why? What happened to him?
neutral	Nothing, hes just really believes in that.
neutral	It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
joy	Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
neutral	Well, okay, so whats nowgo get, go get the eggs, put em in there.
neutral	Okay, itll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
surprise	Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
neutral	Um-hmm, five actually.
neutral	Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
neutral	We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
surprise	Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
neutral	Hey, yknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
neutral	Sweety, now, shes a woman, not a gumball machine.
neutral	Okay, well yknow what, dont worry you guys, cause Im-Im gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
neutral	Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
neutral	Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.
neutral	So, umm, were kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
non-neutral	Whoa!! Thatokay, thats a
neutral	No, Im sorry.
surprise	Wow! You guys really dont know anything!
non-neutral	I know! Why dont you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
neutral	Sorry. So hows it going with Joey?
neutral	Oh just great.
neutral	He beeps me now with codes.
neutral	One is, "Bring me food."
neutral	Two is, "Im with a girl, bring us food."
neutral	Three is, "Im lost and I cant find food."
non-neutral	Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
joy	Yeah! Shes right in there!
joy	Oh great.   Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
neutral	Hey!
neutral	Hey!
surprise	You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
disgust	Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
non-neutral	Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
neutral	I don't know, clean places?
neutral	Umm, yum!
neutral	It's Danny.
fear	Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
non-neutral	We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?
surprise	What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
non-neutral	The fake kind!
neutral	Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
neutral	We have a ladle.
neutral	Thanks, see you at the party.

non-neutral	That's stealing!
neutral	No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
non-neutral	Ohh.
neutral	Okay, one thing at a time.
neutral	Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
joy	Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
joy	Oh, that's great.
surprise	Why are- why are you so tanned?
neutral	Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.

joy	I'm- I'm Monana!
neutral	Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
joy	Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
neutral	What?
non-neutral	They've arrested Monica.
neutral	Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.
neutral	Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
neutral	No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
neutral	Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y.
neutral	I just...
neutral	I wrote that out phonetically for you.
neutral	Phonetically?
neutral	Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this.
neutral	Ok.
surprise	Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
non-neutral	Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"    I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
surprise	Wow. What does
non-neutral	No idea!
non-neutral	But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
neutral	Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?

non-neutral	I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us!
non-neutral	And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
neutral	So umm, does it?
sadness	Im sorry.
fear	Does it?
neutral	Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole Does it? part just another glance.
anger	What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!

neutral	Why dont you tell me what happened.
neutral	Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
surprise	Im sorry, is this the same Rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
non-neutral	Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do

fear	Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
non-neutral	No!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
neutral	But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
neutral	Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
surprise	What?
neutral	Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
neutral	That's alright, I'll take it.
neutral	Bad things happen to me anyway.
neutral	This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
neutral	Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...

non-neutral	You know, we dont really take advantage of living in the city.

non-neutral	Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section?
non-neutral	See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
neutral	We are aware of the problem you are referring to.

non-neutral	I, I cant help you.
non-neutral	Well, fine.
anger	Fine!
anger	If-if Im the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, Ill go up there and defend it myself!

joy	YES!!
neutral	Uh fellas,
neutral	Okay, so he's out of here.
neutral	Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
neutral	I know it doesn't make much sense
neutral	Much
anger	Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
non-neutral	So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
non-neutral	I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!
non-neutral	So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
non-neutral	No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!

neutral	And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too.
non-neutral	And now I have seen her naked.

non-neutral	Well, can you blame her?
joy	Well I dont know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could

disgust	That, that's what's stupid.

neutral	Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
neutral	Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.
neutral	But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary.

neutral	Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here.
disgust	Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet.
disgust	Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle.
non-neutral	So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
non-neutral	Can I be that guy?
joy	Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
non-neutral	Yknow uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
non-neutral	Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
surprise	Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I dont feel that way about you.
non-neutral	Oh no-no-no, thats notNo-no-no!

anger	I am not a pushover!
non-neutral	Who said you were?
anger	You did!
neutral	Oh, Im flaky. Ill say anything.
non-neutral	Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
neutral	That does not sound stupid to me.
neutral	You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?
sadness	I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.
neutral	Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
non-neutral	What uh-oh?
non-neutral	Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done.

neutral	Okay,
anger	Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
disgust	Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
non-neutral	Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
anger	Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
anger	Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
anger	I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
non-neutral	Do not speak ill of the dead.
anger	We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
non-neutral	I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
anger	What did you say?

neutral	Yes.
neutral	Thanks man.
neutral	Okay man.
neutral	But what about how much taller he is than me?
neutral	I mean, theres no way I can make myself taller now, yknow?
non-neutral	And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
surprise	Hey, Monica, wow youve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.

neutral	You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
neutral	Oh honey he doesnt need my help.
non-neutral	Oh, come on! I think hes ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
surprise	Really?!
surprise	Hey, yknow what?
neutral	Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, heres-heres 60 bucks, why dont you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
non-neutral	Yknow what? I dont, I dont think Phoebe really wants to come.
joy	No! I do want to!
neutral	Oh, she does want to.
neutral	She does want to.

non-neutral	But since you were with Ross, I-I didnt do anything about it.

sadness	I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
neutral	Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
non-neutral	But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she.
neutral	It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
surprise	You told him to play the boxer gay!!
non-neutral	Well, I-I mightve said supergay.
non-neutral	You totally screwed him over.
anger	Joey, youre this guys teacher. I mean how could you do this?
neutral	Because, Monica, the guys so good, and I really, really want this part.
neutral	Well, if you really, really want it, then its okay.
neutral	Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
non-neutral	Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so
neutral	I'm not your brother.
anger	What about my children Drake?! Huh!?  No!! No!! No! God!

sadness	Ooh, I miss dating.
neutral	Gettin all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant.
joy	Im not gonna be able to do that for so long, and its so much fun!
neutral	I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
neutral	Hey, yknow what?
neutral	Huh?
neutral	Why dont I take you out?
surprise	What?! Joey, you dont want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
joy	Yes I do!
joy	And were gonna go out, were gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out

sadness	So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
non-neutral	It's over! You
surprise	How can I?
sadness	Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?
sadness	How can I accept that...
sadness	I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.
joy	Kiss me.
surprise	What?
joy	Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
neutral	The bigger half.
joy	I'd like to propose a toast.
joy	Little toast here, ding ding.
joy	I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
non-neutral	Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
joy	So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
joy	That's so sweet.
joy	And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
joy	And a crappy New Year.
joy	Here, here!
anger	Now, hold on!
anger	Hold on!

non-neutral	Oh yeah, I said Rachels name, but it didnt mean anything, Okay?
non-neutral	Shes-shes just a friend and thats all!
non-neutral	Thats all!
non-neutral	Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I cant imagine spending my life with anyone else.
sadness	Please, promise me that youll tell her that.
non-neutral	All right, Ill tell her.  Come on bugger face!
neutral	Call me.
anger	You spend half your life in the bathroom, why dont you ever go out the bloody window!

non-neutral	No touch! No touch!
sadness	Umm ma'am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
surprise	What?
neutral	It's a funny story, actually.
neutral	I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really  know what I was saying.
surprise	You fell asleep?
fear	But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain't that funny?
surprise	Irony?
neutral	Not a fan, alright .
neutral	See, here's  the thing.
neutral	I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go.
joy	See, me, I  love Tulsa!

non-neutral	I like a girl with a strong jaw.
neutral	I'll call you from Tulsa.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	How are you?
neutral	I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
neutral	Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
surprise	That I was not expecting.
neutral	I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
neutral	Oh. Thanks.
joy	No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing
neutral	Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
surprise	I just can't believe you're in here.
sadness	I mean, what am I gonna do without you?
non-neutral	Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?
non-neutral	Who's gonna take me to the

fear	Oh no.
sadness	Oh, I am so sorry.
sadness	No me, I am so sorry...
surprise	Oh my.
fear	Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot.
fear	Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
neutral	Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
neutral	Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
neutral	My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
neutral	No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
neutral	Tho?
non-neutral	Ohhh.
neutral	That's good, have a seat.
neutral	Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle.
neutral	You're just gonna have to be brave, ok?
neutral	Can you do that for me?
neutral	Ok.
neutral	Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?
fear	Yes!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.
anger	Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!
anger	Oh, Ross!
anger	Let go of my hand!
joy	Youre gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!
joy	Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
neutral	Welllets just say

anger	Youre a mean old woman.
non-neutral	No! Wait no! Shut upI mean dont cry! Let me get my checkbook!
non-neutral	Look honey, you dont have to do this, okay?
joy	Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me.
joy	Youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity!
joy	Thats the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
anger	That means nothing to me.  Come on!
non-neutral	Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
neutral	: Hey.

anger	: You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh?
anger	Well, why dont think of someone else for a change?
sadness	Okay, Im sorry.
non-neutral	Hello!
neutral	What's this?
neutral	Oh right its that girl's phone number.
non-neutral	Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me.

joy	Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby!
non-neutral	Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.
neutral	Thank you.
surprise	I dont know how any of these got opened?!
surprise	You opened them all?
non-neutral	I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!
joy	Oh hey! You got my parents gift!
neutral	Yeah. What is that?
non-neutral	Well, I dont know. I think it does something to salami.
non-neutral	Hey! Howd it go?
neutral	Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
non-neutral	Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
joy	I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you.
surprise	Oh wow, you didnt even try to unhook my bra!
neutral	So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
non-neutral	No, I will. Im just not up for it tonight.
non-neutral	Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know youre not gonna be alone in this.

non-neutral	Yknow, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond.
neutral	Yknow?
joy	So,  Rachel Green will you marry me?
neutral	Thank you.
anger	If I cant have it you cant have it!
disgust	I cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical.
neutral	Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget.
neutral	There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and
neutral	Paris?
neutral	We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .

joy	Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because its romantic, but because I can!
joy	I love you!
joy	Yes!

non-neutral	I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
neutral	Listen.
neutral	As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.
neutral	I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
sadness	I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.

neutral	Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
neutral	Hey sweetie.
neutral	Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?

disgust	Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
neutral	What are you saying I should do?
neutral	I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
joy	Thank you, Monica.
neutral	Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
non-neutral	Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.

fear	Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,
non-neutral	Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
neutral	Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me.
neutral	One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
surprise	Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
non-neutral	Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
surprise	All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
neutral	Which proves that I never lie.
neutral	I guess you don't.
non-neutral	Paolo made a pass at me.
fear	Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
neutral	Im not freaking out.
neutral	Why would I be freaking out?
neutral	A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
non-neutral	Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!
neutral	I mean, whats the harm in that?
non-neutral	Right here!
non-neutral	Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel
non-neutral	Phoebe and Rachel!
non-neutral	So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
non-neutral	It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt.
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	Really?
neutral	Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that Im just not ready
neutral	I know! I know.
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	Im gonna go tell Joey that  that youre back. I was really worried about you.
neutral	Hey, did she buy it?

neutral	Yeah, its beautiful.
joy	I cant believe youre gonna ask Monica to marry you!
neutral	I know.
anger	No Phoebe!
anger	You cannot get the phone that way; thats not fair!
neutral	Okay look, I have an idea.
neutral	Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.
neutral	And then whoever does gets the phone.
neutral	Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
non-neutral	I dont think so.
anger	Fine all right, but Id bet youd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
neutral	All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
sadness	Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
non-neutral	Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
sadness	Did I use that already today? Im sorry.

neutral	No, yknow what?
neutral	Its gonna be okay.
neutral	I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast.
neutral	Yknow?
neutral	And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
neutral	Dr. Geller, theres a seat over here.
neutral	Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Im having my lunch at this table, here in the middle.
neutral	Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hell sit with me.
neutral	I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
neutral	Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.
sadness	Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow what I see, I see-I see division.
non-neutral	Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!"
neutral	Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.

non-neutral	Great! Great!  Youre making the bike very happy.
non-neutral	Okay Ross!  Please dont die!
non-neutral	How could you have kept all of this from me?
neutral	I was going to tell you, but
anger	But what?! You figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
anger	Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just  Why dont we just let the machine get that?
neutral	Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it.
non-neutral	No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-II need to, I need to lie down.
joy	Everything on your application looks really goodOhh!
non-neutral	Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
neutral	Oh dont worry, Im not really a party girl.
non-neutral	Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
joy	You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! Ill be living here.
non-neutral	Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it.
surprise	Why did you take the shower curtain down?
fear	That thing was a hazard!  Im very safety conscious.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Hey man, how did the audition go?
sadness	Estelle said I didn't get it.
surprise	What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
non-neutral	Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
surprise	No!
neutral	For all I know, shes trying to find me but couldnt because I kept moving around.
neutral	No, from now on, Im staying in one place.
neutral	Right here.
neutral	Well, its getting late.
neutral	Yeah, were gonna go.
neutral	Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
neutral	Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
neutral	Yeah, its a very large plane.
neutral	Thats cool.
neutral	But, well stay here with you.
joy	Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, yknow, but you dont have to rub my butt.
surprise	Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
surprise	Theyre not a couple!
neutral	Oh-okay, I get the game now.
neutral	Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
joy	Oh yeah!
neutral	Well okay, so then youre fine.
neutral	The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.
neutral	Okay?
neutral	So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.
neutral	Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.
surprise	Really?
neutral	Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
neutral	No.
neutral	Noooo!!
surprise	Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, its me! Phoebe!
neutral	Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.
surprise	Wait a second! So, whats new with you?
neutral	Umm, nothing. I mean, Im getting married next week.
surprise	And your breasts! Hmm!!!
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	Umm look, youre coming on a little strong.
neutral	But Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together.
neutral	So, why dont we just start over okay?
neutral	And you can just tell me about yourself.
neutral	All right.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	I write erotic novels, for children.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Theyre wildly unpopular.
disgust	Oh my God!
neutral	Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
surprise	Wow! You do?
joy	Yeah,  a Pretty Huge
disgust	All right.
non-neutral	So, uh, how's she doing?
sadness	The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
non-neutral	How-how are you, Mom?
non-neutral	Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
surprise	What?
surprise	What's different?
neutral	Nothing.
neutral	Oh, maybe that's it.
non-neutral	She is unbelievable, our mother is...
neutral	Okay, relax, relax.
neutral	We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
surprise	Oh God!
neutral	The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
surprise	Oh!
disgust	...Yeah, they were gross.
joy	Oh, you know what I loved?
joy	Her Sweet 'n' Los.
joy	How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
neutral	Not just restaurants, from our house.
neutral	Maybe.
surprise	You can't!
surprise	Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said.
neutral	In the hall.
neutral	Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.
neutral	But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.
neutral	Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
neutral	Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
joy	That's a good one!
neutral	Hey, Joe.
neutral	Dad, Ronni's here.
surprise	Huh?
neutral	So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal.
neutral	Anything at all.
neutral	But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
joy	Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
anger	Im Monicas maid of honor. Okay? Dont try to blue pin me!
neutral	Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.
non-neutral	Limited seating my ass. Lets see who made the cut.  Hi!
neutral	Im Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
non-neutral	Used to work with her. Used to! Im a relative and I didnt get invited! A
non-neutral	Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
joy	So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
neutral	Okay, youre fine.
surprise	Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
neutral	Youll see.
non-neutral	I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
non-neutral	Oh God.
neutral	Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and yknow fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles
neutral	And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and  You go.
neutral	But-but, if you dont love this, well do it in any other place at any other time.
neutral	Really, its fine, whatever you want.
joy	Its perfect.
non-neutral	And, I dont know, if it starts to rain
non-neutral	Well then well get wet.
sadness	Ohh. And I dont even have a date.
neutral	Coming.
anger	I have a bone to pick with you.
fear	Uh-oh.
non-neutral	Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
surprise	Oh yeah? Did he pull the old
joy	Thats right! Thats right!
neutral	Oh that.
anger	Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! Theyre mean and theyre stupid and-and I dont want my son learning them!
anger	Yknow what? It doesnt matter! Because it is not true!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	And if it were true, how
neutral	Ms. Monroe  Oh there you go.
surprise	Mark's a genius!
surprise	Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
non-neutral	Look, don't you see what's happening here.
non-neutral	Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.
neutral	Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
fear	What am I going to do?
neutral	Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.
neutral	All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
fear	I don't know you guys.
disgust	All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.
disgust	And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
non-neutral	And before you know it, she's with him.
non-neutral	And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'
non-neutral	And he'll be all, 'Yes!'
non-neutral	And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'
disgust	And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'
disgust	And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
non-neutral	He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
neutral	This is what Ive got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
neutral	Great. Great.
neutral	Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, Ive got you, me, and Chandler and Im gonna invite Gunther cause, well, weve been talking about this pretty loud.
neutral	Ill be there.
non-neutral	All rightoh!
neutral	Listen, I know this is your party, but Id really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
neutral	Yeah. Tell ya what, lets not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
neutral	Okay! Well need a six-pack of
neutral	Hey guys, what are you doing?
neutral	Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.
non-neutral	Oh, come on!
neutral	Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him.
neutral	Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there.
neutral	Well, Chandler will be there for you too.
neutral	I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, hell be there.
neutral	And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot.
neutral	What do ya say? What do ya say?
neutral	Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.
neutral	But, all right, I dontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk.
non-neutral	I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to name my kid!
non-neutral	What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
surprise	I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
non-neutral	Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
surprise	What's that supposed to mean?
neutral	Nothing! It's an expression.
neutral	No it's not.
neutral	Don't listen to your mother.
neutral	You're independent, and you always have been!
non-neutral	Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!
neutral	And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
neutral	PBS Telethon.
neutral	Hi Joey.
joy	Hey Pheebs!
neutral	I
surprise	$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what
non-neutral	Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not
surprise	What kind of problem?
non-neutral	Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!
surprise	Oh my God!
non-neutral	Nooooo!
non-neutral	Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
non-neutral	Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
non-neutral	I don't wanna give up the bag.
anger	I don't have to give up the bag!
non-neutral	Do I Rach?
anger	Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
neutral	Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it
surprise	Oh, hey!
non-neutral	I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
non-neutral	I can't believe I'm hearing this!
non-neutral	Wait a minute!
non-neutral	Wait a minute!
neutral	I'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.
neutral	Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
neutral	I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
joy	Okay, great.
neutral	They say he's only got half a tank left.
surprise	Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
non-neutral	We're switching rooms again.
surprise	What? Why?
anger	This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
non-neutral	Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
non-neutral	Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
neutral	Uh-huh.
non-neutral	Chandler!
anger	Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
anger	Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
surprise	Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
joy	Hey!
surprise	Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didnt think you were coming.
joy	Oh, I wouldnt miss this.
joy	Well, Im very glad youre here.
joy	Oh, youre such a gentleman.  Come on! Were going to my place!
joy	Hey!
neutral	Hey-hey.
neutral	So are guys doing okay?
neutral	Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
neutral	Do you have a minute?
neutral	Well yeah, sure, whats up?
non-neutral	I got asked out twice today when I was at lunchby guys.
surprise	Oh really?!
non-neutral	Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
non-neutral	Oh, did you not want people to know that?
non-neutral	But Im not gay. And I especially wouldnt want you to think I was gay.
neutral	Whys that?
neutral	I dont think I should say.
neutral	Ohh, you can say. Come on, I dont want you to feel like you cant tell me things.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Kay.
neutral	Well
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Id love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
neutral	Yeah, shes gay.
neutral	Here you go.
joy	Great! All right, so Ill call you later.
joy	Great!
surprise	Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
neutral	That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.
surprise	Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
neutral	No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
surprise	What?
non-neutral	Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
surprise	Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!
surprise	Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
disgust	Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
non-neutral	What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.
non-neutral	Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.
neutral	But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.
surprise	You got all that from the back of her head?
neutral	All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
neutral	Whos Elaine?
non-neutral	Can you people not see me?!
neutral	So, will you talk to him?
neutral	I dont know Rach.
non-neutral	Oh, come on! Ill give you ten free
anger	One!  No ten! You said ten! You cant take that back!
joy	Hey!
joy	Hi!
neutral	Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?
neutral	We need a porn break.
neutral	We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
non-neutral	Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?
neutral	Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
joy	Ooh, good, youre hear! Okay.
joy	Hey!
joy	Hi!
non-neutral	Well, what-what cha got there?
joy	Oh this, well Im glad you asked.
disgust	Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?
non-neutral	Ahh!
neutral	Now, I know what youre thinking
non-neutral	Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
surprise	Phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they?
non-neutral	No!
neutral	Are you sure?
anger	No!
neutral	Honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
neutral	No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
neutral	Whats the second part of your plan?
neutral	Yes thats right.
surprise	Why?
neutral	I tired attacking two women, did not work.
surprise	What?!
neutral	No, I mean its okay, I mean, theyre-theyre my friends.
non-neutral	In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
non-neutral	Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
surprise	Oh, no!
surprise	No-no!
surprise	No, I tired!
neutral	But I couldnt.
non-neutral	Thats why Im here.
neutral	Maybe we could attack them together?
neutral	That-thats a no.
non-neutral	What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross!
anger	Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross!
anger	I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
non-neutral	All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
non-neutral	No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
neutral	No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
joy	I like that.
neutral	Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
neutral	Huh?
neutral	One swift kick and hell back off.
neutral	All right, bad ankle, got it!
neutral	And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesnt wear a cup.
joy	Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
neutral	And uh, Liam, Liams got bad knees. You hit him right and hell go down like a lamp.
non-neutral	But-but, Liams on my team.
anger	I dont care! You just get him!
joy	Im gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
joy	The Red Ross! Okay.
neutral	Oh!  Oh by the way?
neutral	Uh-hmm.
neutral	James Brolin?
neutral	Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered hes gay.
neutral	Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
surprise	Really?!
neutral	Hello?
neutral	Hello, is Ross there?
neutral	Uh no, hes not. Can I take a message?
neutral	Yes, this Russell, Rosss divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I havent heard from him, I assume hes decided to give the marriage a try.
surprise	Ross got married againNooooooo!!!!!!!!!
non-neutral	Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking!
non-neutral	Oh!  Shes growing inside you.
surprise	Whoa!!
surprise	Oh!
surprise	Wow that was a big one.
non-neutral	I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.
non-neutral	Oh hey you guys!
neutral	Sure, I can hang out til I have to meet ya.  What uhHow come youre not going?
neutral	I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
neutral	I thought you already have a job.
neutral	And people say you dont pay attention.
neutral	No, this is a much better job.
neutral	Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
surprise	Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
neutral	Thats what I do now.
neutral	Hey Joey, come taste this.
neutral	What is it?
anger	Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well  Im getting my revenge!
surprise	You cooked him?
neutral	No.
neutral	He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again.
joy	Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow!
joy	"Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
non-neutral	The front page? You really do live in your own little world, dont ya?
neutral	So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
disgust	No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
sadness	Were never gonna find anybody.
joy	Well then let me do it!
non-neutral	Joe
non-neutral	No-no-no!
neutral	Look, Ive been thinking about it.
neutral	Im an actor right?
neutral	So I wont get nervous talking in front of people.
non-neutral	Joey look its really sweet
non-neutral	No-no-no-no look no!
non-neutral	I wont spit, and I wont stare at Monicas breasts!
neutral	Yknow?
joy	Everyone knows Im an ass man!
neutral	That is true.
joy	Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.
joy	Itll be me!
joy	And I swear Ill do a really good job.
joy	Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
neutral	Yknow, we havent found anybody else.
joy	It might be kinda cool.
joy	So I can do it?
joy	Ah-ha! Too cocky!
non-neutral	I still cant believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
neutral	Of course I do! And Im gonna give it back to you as soon as theyre done with it at the key shining place.
non-neutral	What the hell is that?
surprise	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
neutral	You said there was a gas leak in here.
neutral	Well why dont you use your key?
neutral	Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded.
neutral	If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions.
anger	Come on!
non-neutral	Hurry up.
neutral	Oh! We could have done that.
neutral	Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about.
sadness	Oh, Im so sorry.
non-neutral	Um, and maybe Im wrong!
neutral	I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more.
surprise	You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him?
neutral	Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat.
neutral	(walking up with this
non-neutral	God Ross, what is that?
non-neutral	Oh, but its made her so happy.
neutral	Little girl misses her cat.
non-neutral	Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.
neutral	Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Thank you.
neutral	I
non-neutral	He is right, isnt he?
neutral	Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong.
surprise	You think?
neutral	Oh-no, hes right.
joy	Seven hundred bucks!
joy	Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
non-neutral	Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
neutral	Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
disgust	What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
neutral	Oh.
neutral	Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
neutral	Me too.
neutral	Although this city is my home, so.
neutral	So thats dumb what I said, dont tell him I said that.
neutral	Umm, you make something up.
joy	Nice,  thank you.
neutral	This is me.
neutral	Here.
non-neutral	Your eyes are very pretty.
joy	Thank you, very much! Oh!  Thank you!
neutral	He would like to kiss you.
neutral	Okay, y'know what, you dont have to do that now.
non-neutral	No-no-no-no!!
surprise	Not him, you dont!
neutral	Well the moments over.
neutral	Oh.
non-neutral	Oy!
non-neutral	Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
neutral	Id really prefer a mountain bike.
neutral	Janices birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
surprise	Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa.
non-neutral	Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
disgust	Thats a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. I would like to get her something serious.
neutral	Oh, you want something serious.
neutral	Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas.
neutral	Those are dead serious.
non-neutral	All right. Look, Im gonna go in here, and you dont buy me anything ever.
fear	No, no, you cant, you cant, okay, you cant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, you cant.
surprise	Why not?!
neutral	Oh God. Uh, okay, heres the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
non-neutral	What is the thing?
non-neutral	Okay. I went down to the Mattress King showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
surprise	What?
non-neutral	They were in his office.
sadness	Well she, she wouldnt do that, shes with, shes with me.
non-neutral	All right!!
non-neutral	Im telling you its like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
surprise	Youre drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe Im a little drunk.
joy	Oh thats great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please?  There we go.
non-neutral	Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
neutral	How are you feeling?
neutral	You are
non-neutral	I really wish that you wouldnt.
neutral	Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?
neutral	Then we can put you in bed, okay?
neutral	Just smile and dont talk to
joy	Speech! Speech! Lets hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
non-neutral	Pheebs!!
joy	Dont you see? Everyones looking at me! The plans working! I didnt even have to take off my top yet!
joy	Speech! Come on Monica!
joy	Come on!
joy	Come on! Speech!
non-neutral	Hey Chandler, you cant keep your hands off her for one second!
joy	Oh-ho, I think its nice.
neutral	Well you have to because maybe its stupid.
joy	Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
non-neutral	Oh crap!
neutral	All right.
neutral	The super couldnt figure out what it did.
non-neutral	A $200 an hour electrician couldnt figure out what it did.
non-neutral	Ive had seven pretty serious shocks.
disgust	I officially give up.
joy	Thank God.
non-neutral	I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
non-neutral	See? Im doing it. I am totally doing it.  I lost it.
non-neutral	Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
neutral	He doesn't have anyone.
non-neutral	Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
disgust	I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
joy	Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
neutral	Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
neutral	You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
neutral	Y'know, we don't have to watch this.
non-neutral	No way, forget it.
non-neutral	C'mon, she's your mom!
neutral	Exactly.
joy	Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books!
joy	I love her books!
joy	I cannot get on a plane without one!
joy	I mean, this is so cool!
disgust	Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
joy	C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
neutral	Thank you.
neutral	And a nice hot cider for Monica.
neutral	Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?
neutral	Yeah?
surprise	Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
surprise	Oh! That's why.  I'm sorry!
neutral	Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
neutral	Yes?
non-neutral	You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
neutral	Yeah I can, it worked real well.
anger	No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
anger	I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette.
anger	Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
surprise	What?!
non-neutral	Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em.
surprise	Who are you talking too?
disgust	Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
neutral	I am
anger	You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.   Backup! Backup!!
fear	I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
neutral	Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
fear	Shh! Get me out of here.
neutral	Oh.
surprise	Ross!
neutral	What?
surprise	Come here, check this out!
neutral	What? Is it the comet?
surprise	No! No-no. Look, theres a bug stuck in tar right here.
non-neutral	Joey comeI cant believeI bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of natures most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
neutral	Yknow, theres
neutral	Show me where?
neutral	Right-right up here.
neutral	Joey wheres the pipe that was holding the door open?
non-neutral	I dont know!   Yeah, I do.
anger	Joey!
anger	What?! All rightHey! Dont look at me! Youre the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid
anger	Its called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
surprise	Oh no! No! No!
joy	Wow! This place is incredible!  Stings penthat he gave to Phoebe.  Come on! Secret passageway!
neutral	Hi!
neutral	Hi!
neutral	Im Trudie.
neutral	Uh-huh.
neutral	You must be Bens mum.
neutral	Why else would I be here?
neutral	Do sit down.
neutral	Yeah.
joy	Oh Rach thats great. Thats great.
neutral	Hi.. how was the game?
neutral	Well..
joy	WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
surprise	Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
neutral	Alan.
joy	He was unbelievable.
joy	He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
joy	I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
joy	Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
neutral	Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
surprise	What?
neutral	..I dunno, a little too Alan?
non-neutral	Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
non-neutral	Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
joy	I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
joy	Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, thats the first A Ive gotten since seventh grade,
non-neutral	Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
surprise	What the hell!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	All right, lets start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
disgust	Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
surprise	My God!
surprise	These pants are burning up!
surprise	Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!
non-neutral	What is she trying to kill me?
surprise	It's like a volcano in here!
neutral	Are you hot?
neutral	Okay, it must just be me then.
neutral	That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
anger	You're driving me crazy with that!
neutral	Okay, I'll stop.
non-neutral	Dont stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
non-neutral	Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
neutral	You wanna play?
neutral	Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon.
neutral	And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
neutral	Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
joy	All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
non-neutral	I'm intrigued.
neutral	All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
non-neutral	Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
non-neutral	Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
neutral	Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
neutral	Uh yeah, right here.
joy	Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
neutral	What's that?
neutral	Weeeell, it's rum, and-
neutral	I'm sure they'll be here soon.
neutral	Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
neutral	Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
fear	You are really frightening me.
fear	Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?
neutral	All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
neutral	All right, honey, time to start pushing.
fear	But they're not here yet!
neutral	I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
fear	Oh, god.
non-neutral	Here we go. Mona umm, I think its time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
neutral	Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
non-neutral	Aw, we-we are so So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, yknow hanging out with you.
joy	And I mean-Im having a lot of fun.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if its just fun.
non-neutral	Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right?
neutral	So where-where is it going?
surprise	Ah!
neutral	Thats-thats the real question.
joy	And-and the answer isis its going somewherefun.
neutral	Now I-I know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger.
fear	No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou
non-neutral	Im sorry, so umm, so where are we?
neutral	Yknow what?
joy	I am going to take you out to dinner tonight.
joy	I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .
non-neutral	No?
surprise	Really?
joy	They taste so good.
neutral	Drum roll.
neutral	Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
neutral	Nah, youre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
neutral	All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
surprise	Youre actually going through with this?
non-neutral	Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.
neutral	Okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
non-neutral	You got problems because of you!
non-neutral	Not your name!
anger	All right, this has got to stop!
anger	Chandler is a great name!
non-neutral	In factyes,  Im, Im sorry.
neutral	I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, Im-Im, Im gonna, Im gonna name the baby Chandler.
surprise	Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
neutral	It was.
sadness	Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, thats not gonna be me, not me.
surprise	Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
neutral	No.
surprise	Whoa. That was really good.
neutral	Thanks, any suggestions?
non-neutral	Hi!
surprise	You-youyou had sex with Ursula?!
fear	Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and
surprise	You didnt notice she was wearing different clothes?!
non-neutral	Well I was just so excited to see you.
disgust	Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird.
non-neutral	No-no its not!
fear	I dont want to lose you!
non-neutral	Its-its like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was youYeah it is too weird.
non-neutral	So I guess this is it.
non-neutral	Yeah.  Maybe its for the best. You smell just like her.
non-neutral	Yeah, so do you.
joy	Hey!
neutral	Hi.
neutral	So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
sadness	Manhattan does not have enough stores.
neutral	Well,
surprise	You can?
neutral	Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
neutral	Um-hmm.
neutral	And a small piece of chocolate.
neutral	Okay.
sadness	Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship
non-neutral	I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
non-neutral	Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
non-neutral	Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
non-neutral	I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
surprise	Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?
neutral	No! No! Not, Paris.
joy	Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
non-neutral	Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. Thats right, yes, Im being transferred to Yemen!
non-neutral	When?
neutral	I dont know exactly.
sadness	Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
non-neutral	But I do know that its some time tomorrow.
joy	Ooh, this is it!  Oh, thats him! Thats him!
joy	Great! Go get him.
neutral	Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
neutral	Hes not really my type.
neutral	No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see whats he like. People tell doctors everything.
surprise	But you said he was this great guy!
sadness	But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
sadness	You do attract some stinkers.
neutral	Chandler.
neutral	Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a
neutral	Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
neutral	Oh, listen.
neutral	If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them.
non-neutral	Really.
neutral	Nothing at all.
non-neutral	Really.
neutral	Nothing.
neutral	Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
non-neutral	Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one?
non-neutral	No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.
neutral	Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out?
non-neutral	No, no, I keep trying, yknow?
sadness	I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "go to the bathroom."
neutral	He may think Im sick.
neutral	Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with!
neutral	Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them.
neutral	Okay?
neutral	Thats it.
non-neutral	Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna order me around all the time?
neutral	Pretty much.
neutral	All right.
joy	Hey Monica!
joy	Hi!
neutral	Hey man, you feeling any better?
neutral	Joey, we have something to tell you.
surprise	Oh my God! Youre pregnant!
neutral	Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, youre only married in Vegas.
neutral	What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youre married everywhere.
surprise	Really?!
neutral	Yeah!
surprise	Oh my God!Eh! Well
disgust	You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave hes going straight to the porn.
neutral	Hes gonna go up to the counter with
neutral	Yeah.
non-neutral	I missed this.
non-neutral	Me too.
neutral	So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
joy	Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
anger	Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
neutral	We will.
neutral	Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
neutral	No Mon,
neutral	Every year.
neutral	And
joy	Hey! Ross!
neutral	Die Hard
neutral	Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
neutral	Whatd you rent?
neutral	Die Hard 2
neutral	Joey, this is
neutral	Oh, well we watch it a second time and its
neutral	Joey, we
neutral	And?
joy	And itll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
neutral	Die Hard
neutral	Dude, you didnt say
neutral	Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
non-neutral	Well, John McClane had plans!
neutral	No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
non-neutral	What are you talking about? Bitch.
non-neutral	I know you botched that operation on purpose.
anger	I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder.
disgust	I don't care if you    are my brother.
joy	Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch!
anger	Stop going through my stuff !
joy	Hey!
joy	Hey!
non-neutral	I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
fear	No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
non-neutral	Please, what about you and Chandler?
non-neutral	That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
non-neutral	Well hello !
non-neutral	What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?
anger	I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
non-neutral	Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
non-neutral	I'm gonna do it.
neutral	And I can't stop you.
neutral	No.
neutral	Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
neutral	I'm smarter than
non-neutral	Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
joy	Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
neutral	Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im heading up there.
neutral	Uh, yeah, Ill take a coffee. Thanks, man.
non-neutral	Sure.  Coffee? Cause Im going up there.
neutral	No.
neutral	No, thank you.
neutral	You guys need anything, cause Im heading up there.
neutral	Id love an ice water.
neutral	You got it.
surprise	Joey, what are you doing?
non-neutral	Just being friendly.
non-neutral	Joey, honey, I dont think youre supposed to go back there.
neutral	Nah, its okay. Right, Gunther?
non-neutral	Dont wink at me. And put on your apron.
non-neutral	Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
surprise	Joey, do you work here?
neutral	No.
neutral	Hey, waiter.
neutral	Yeah?
neutral	Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening.  Yeah we are.
neutral	Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.
neutral	Im calling for Monica Geller.
neutral	I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
surprise	This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!!
neutral	Thank you.
neutral	Thanks.
non-neutral	I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
neutral	Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am
non-neutral	This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
neutral	So go fix it!
neutral	Go find Chandler!
non-neutral	He's probably up in your room!
non-neutral	Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
joy	Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
joy	Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
neutral	Anybody lose this?
joy	Comin' out. Place your bet.  Dice are out.  Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
neutral	Hmm.
neutral	Do you remember where the duck food is?
surprise	Yeah, its in the guys apartment under the sink. Why?
neutral	Because Im going to London.
surprise	What?! What do you mean youre going to London?
neutral	Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.
neutral	Now honey, you take care, you dont have those babies until I get back.
non-neutral	IRachel, you cant go! Ross loves Emily!
non-neutral	Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does.
non-neutral	But I have to tell him how I feel!
neutral	He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
non-neutral	Thats not why youre going!
non-neutral	Youre going because you hope hes gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach.
non-neutral	Forget that British chippy."
surprise	OhhDo you think he will?!
non-neutral	No!
non-neutral	Because hes in love with the British chippy!
non-neutral	Look, Rachel, if you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!
anger	Yknow, its too late!
sadness	You missed youre chance!
sadness	Im sorry, I know this must be really hard, its over.
non-neutral	Yknow what? No. Its not over until someone says, "I do."
non-neutral	I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. Im carrying a litter.
neutral	So is everybody here?
neutral	I got here a little early myself.
neutral	Let us begin.
neutral	Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.
neutral	Here.
neutral	Here.
neutral	Now as for the hydrosaurs
neutral	Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night.
sadness	Ive ah, Ive recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry.
sadness	So, do you think you can forgive me?
joy	Great.
joy	Thanks.
neutral	Okay, bye.
neutral	Hello, Jennifer?
surprise	Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there?
surprise	Oh, shes not home huh?
neutral	Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
non-neutral	Hey!
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Are you all right?
fear	Uhh… I think I just got engaged.
surprise	Oh my God! He did it?
non-neutral	Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?
surprise	Are you kidding?
non-neutral	I'm like the one who talked him into it.
non-neutral	I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
non-neutral	And you really think this is a good idea?
neutral	I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people.
non-neutral	I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.
surprise	Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so.
surprise	Really?! Even Ross?
joy	Especially Ross!
neutral	Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come  back later.
surprise	Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just…I'll  come back.
joy	There he goes, your fiancée.
neutral	I guess so.
neutral	Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
neutral	I can't say that I'm surprised.
sadness	Oh, that is so unfortunate.
neutral	What?
non-neutral	Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
neutral	Okay, Ill be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe Im sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
neutral	You didnt leave lipstick marks on the phone.
neutral	Oh, then it mustve been you. Bye.
non-neutral	Bye-bye!  Thats why I moved out.
neutral	Hey, y'know while were on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you dont live here anymore.
neutral	I think on some levels she already knows.
neutral	Night Mon. Night Julio.
neutral	Adios.
surprise	Look Julio, someone left their book here.
neutral	Ah actually, that is mine.
neutral	Oh yeah, what are you reading?
neutral	Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
neutral	Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?
neutral	I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
neutral	Your a poet and don't know it.
neutral	Actually I ah, I am a poet.
neutral	Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?
neutral	Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
neutral	Mine?  Right here?
joy	I can write an epic poem about this lip.
joy	How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
neutral	Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
surprise	What?
neutral	I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
surprise	What?
neutral	Were at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
surprise	Are we really in Montreal?!
neutral	Yes we are. So, coffee?
non-neutral	Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
neutral	Oh, no. But its just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
neutral	Okay, heres batch 22.
non-neutral	Oh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers.
neutral	This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
neutral	Lets give it a shot.
neutral	Okay. Man, I have
surprise	Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
neutral	No, just a Friday night.
neutral	Would she?
anger	Would she?  You ate my candy bar!
disgust	Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
sadness	I know honey, Im sorry.
sadness	Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in.
non-neutral	Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
sadness	Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt....
disgust	I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
anger	Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
fear	Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
anger	Its not funny, this is actually my job.
neutral	Oh believe me, I-I-Ive been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
non-neutral	Oh well then, so Im just going to go back to talking to my friend here.
non-neutral	And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
neutral	Ah, just one other thing.
non-neutral	Yes?!
neutral	I ah, I work at
neutral	Do you want my pickle?
neutral	Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
surprise	Why?
neutral	Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
surprise	Oh my God.
neutral	Phoebe.
non-neutral	Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
joy	Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.
non-neutral	He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
joy	We should do something. Whistle.
non-neutral	We are not going to whistle.
neutral	Come on, do it.
non-neutral	No!
joy	Do it!
non-neutral	No!
joy	Do it do it do it!
joy	Woo-woo!
surprise	I can't believe you did that!
neutral	Hi! Umm, Im Monica Geller, Im the chef at Alessandros.
surprise	Still?
non-neutral	I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
non-neutral	I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
anger	Either eat it, or be in it.
non-neutral	Spoon?  So, what do you think?
disgust	Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.
non-neutral	Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; theres a new class comin in.
neutral	Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
neutral	I can.
neutral	Okay, go ahead.
neutral	Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
neutral	Thats very good, whats your name?
neutral	Monica.
neutral	Monica, you go to the head of the class.
joy	Okay.
neutral	And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,    it's a place I've never seeeeen.
neutral	But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen.
neutral	Humaaan spleeeeen.
joy	Olè!
surprise	What are you doing here!
joy	Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain!
joy	Great!
joy	Yeah!
joy	It really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs!
non-neutral	Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
non-neutral	Listen Phoebe...
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but...
neutral	But what?
neutral	This is kind of a classy place.
neutral	Ok, say no more.
non-neutral	I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
neutral	Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
non-neutral	Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
non-neutral	Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
neutral	I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention
neutral	Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
non-neutral	We can't. We're not pharmacists!
neutral	I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba...
neutral	Kate Miller?
neutral	Kate Miller it is.
non-neutral	And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
neutral	In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
neutral	Thank you.
surprise	Oh my God!
sadness	We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
non-neutral	This year was supposed to be great!
disgust	But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
sadness	No. No, you're not a loser.
non-neutral	Look at me!
joy	Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
non-neutral	Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
joy	See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
joy	Yeah!
joy	That really is something; that's really cool.
joy	Howdy partner!
joy	Maybe I should get another pair!
joy	Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.
joy	I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.
non-neutral	I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
joy	I would make a good cowboy.
neutral	Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
neutral	Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.
non-neutral	No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
surprise	Oh yeah!

neutral	No, no, to test his neck strength.
non-neutral	No, Mike, I don't want to kill him!
non-neutral	I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
neutral	Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.

neutral	Oh yeah, no problem.
neutral	Thanks.

surprise	Joey!
surprise	What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
anger	Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!
anger	So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.
anger	I said, "No!"

non-neutral	Oh, was it awful?
non-neutral	Well, it was loong.
neutral	I didnt even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 oclock shadow on her head.
sadness	Anyway, she didnt want to stay.
neutral	I called a cab; she just left.
neutral	I wrote you a letter.
joy	Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
neutral	Its just some things Ive been thinking about.
neutral	Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
neutral	Okay.  Wow, its-its 5:30 in the morning.  So, Id better get cracking on this baby.
neutral	Well, Ill be waiting for you, just come up when youre done.

non-neutral	The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!

disgust	But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasnt it.
disgust	Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice!
disgust	You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
anger	Hey! Im proud of that sauce, its delicious.
surprise	Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
neutral	Lebanon.
non-neutral	Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
neutral	How long is this gonna take? Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
neutral	Okay, then what happened?
non-neutral	Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn!
neutral	Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
anger	Nothing!   This is not over!

neutral	Right?
non-neutral	We just broke up, first thing she does!
neutral	You didnt just break up.
anger	Hey, its been like three weeks!
disgust	You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
neutral	Thats Bill Clinton.
neutral	Whos he huggin?
surprise	Oh my God! Thats Pete! But why is Bill huggin Pete?
non-neutral	This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
joy	We use it!!
joy	There you go!!
surprise	Oh my God, Monicas gonna go out with a millionaire.
neutral	Im not gonna go out with him.
surprise	Oh my God, I cant believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
non-neutral	Or incredibly offensive.
neutral	Oh yeah, sure, that too.
neutral	What?
neutral	Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?

non-neutral	Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
neutral	Hello, Chip.
non-neutral	Hey, Rach! How ya doin?
joy	Im great! Im great. Ive got a great job at
neutral	So ah, Monica ready yet?
neutral	Shell be out in a second. So, Chip, hows umm, Amy Welch?
surprise	Amy Welch? Wow! I havent seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
joy	Thats right, I love you! And-and Im gonna play with you all the time.
surprise	How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
neutral	Hes talking to the baby.
surprise	Ohh!
surprise	Okay!
surprise	Okay, cause when-when he said, "I cant wait to hear your first words," I thought, "Theres a trick."
neutral	Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. Ill see you later.
neutral	Okay.
surprise	Oh my, oh my God!
surprise	Aw, its unbelievable!
surprise	Wow!

non-neutral	I have never known love like this.
surprise	You really like it?
surprise	Dude! How-how did you write this?
neutral	I stole Monicas and changed the name.
neutral	You cant
joy	If he goes first he can!
surprise	Hey!
non-neutral	Yeah!
neutral	Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, yknow?
neutral	Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
joy	Oh wow thats a great idea! And
neutral	Here you go.
non-neutral	Oh.
joy	Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one.
neutral	Here you go.
neutral	Yknow I gotta tell ya, sometimes I justI dont get Chandler.
neutral	Yknow, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you dont get all upset.
non-neutral	All the time?
non-neutral	All the time!
neutral	Cassie, how you-how you doin on thathot dog.
neutral	Im all done.
joy	Thank God.
neutral	I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
neutral	Oh right.
neutral	Right.
joy	Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you til you cried?
sadness	Were probably too old to do that now.
joy	Ill always remember that summer, because its when I got all of these freckles.
joy	Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and Ill always remember that summer because thats when I realized that we are related.
surprise	It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
neutral	Well Im, Im a little slow.  Just as our children would be.
neutral	Relax every muscle in your body.
neutral	Listen to the plinky-plunky music.
neutral	Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place.
neutral	Okay, tell me your happy place.
joy	Richard's living room, drinking wine.
anger	All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
non-neutral	I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
neutral	Well, okay, fine, use my happy place.
neutral	Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
neutral	All right, I'll try not to.
neutral	Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
sadness	Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
joy	All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
sadness	I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
neutral	All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place.
neutral	Okay.
joy	Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains.
neutral	And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
disgust	Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
neutral	OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
neutral	See you later Rach.
neutral	Bye-bye Julie.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey.
non-neutral	Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
neutral	Hey?
neutral	What?
neutral	Can I ask you somethin'?
non-neutral	Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
neutral	Ok.
neutral	Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
neutral	What's up?
neutral	F.Y.I..
neutral	I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons.
neutral	Her name is Stephanie... something.
neutral	She's supposed to be very good.
surprise	But what about Phoebe?
disgust	Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
sadness	Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
neutral	Uh...
non-neutral	Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
non-neutral	Ahh, no.
neutral	Oh.
surprise	Are you jealous?
non-neutral	Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all.
non-neutral	I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
non-neutral	You are totally jealous.
non-neutral	I'm not jealous.
neutral	All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers.
neutral	And y'know, and um, I...
neutral	Honey, I love you too.
non-neutral	Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
surprise	What?
surprise	Huh.
non-neutral	Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
neutral	Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
surprise	I cant believe you came back.
non-neutral	Dont say anything.
neutral	I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna think.
joy	I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
joy	Rachel! Rachel!
neutral	What?
surprise	You missed the exit!
neutral	Oh, sorry.
surprise	My God, what were you thinking about?
neutral	Um,  Barry.
non-neutral	Awwww!!
surprise	I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
non-neutral	Dude!
joy	And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.
surprise	God!
non-neutral	All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
neutral	Well actually, Ross doesn't.
neutral	Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
neutral	Dear Mary-Angela.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Hows it going.
non-neutral	This is the hardest letter Ive ever had to write.
disgust	What the hells a matter with you?
non-neutral	How do you think Joeys going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
neutral	Well, thats the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually Ill be in Cuba.
neutral	All right, look, look, youve got to do this yourself, okay in person.
neutral	At least you know her name.
neutral	You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
non-neutral	What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
non-neutral	Where in Cuba?
neutral	Hey.
non-neutral	You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
surprise	Oh! I knew it! What happened?
non-neutral	Umm, she kissed me.
surprise	What?! You kissed!
neutral	All right.
neutral	Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?
neutral	A two and a five.
joy	Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
surprise	Really?!
neutral	Oh yeah! Okay, lets play again.  What do you got?
neutral	A four and a nine.
surprise	Youre kidding right?
neutral	No. Why?
surprise	Well thats a full cup!
joy	Damn! I am good at Cups!
surprise	What? Why? Where are you?
neutral	Im still on the set!
non-neutral	Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
non-neutral	I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go until we get this.
non-neutral	Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister.
non-neutral	No! No, Im the minister! Alright, look-look, put em both on the phone, Ill marry them right now.
non-neutral	Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
anger	Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I have the power!
non-neutral	Oh hey Joey! What's up?
neutral	I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
neutral	Yeah, I've been around.
neutral	Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
neutral	Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.
surprise	Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees!
neutral	Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.
joy	Great! Problem solved!
non-neutral	Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
neutral	All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
surprise	Why?
non-neutral	Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
anger	Bastard!
surprise	You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping orOh!
surprise	All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
non-neutral	Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
surprise	Oh!
surprise	Oh, I can't believe it!
joy	I mean I think it's great!
neutral	For him.
neutral	She might be able to do better.
neutral	Hey guys!
neutral	Joey! Come here! Come here!
surprise	What? What?
neutral	Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
neutral	You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
neutral	No. Joey, she
surprise	Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
neutral	Yes, but y'know what?
neutral	It doesn't matter who knows what.
neutral	Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!
joy	Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
neutral	It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
neutral	Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta change things.
surprise	You really think it would be that different?
surprise	How could it not be?
sadness	I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
sadness	And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a
neutral	Well, things change.
sadness	I dont want them to move to a
neutral	Itll be okay Joe.
surprise	Its still there!
neutral	Mrs. Braverman must be out.
non-neutral	She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.
fear	By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
fear	No that could kill her.
neutral	Well, we dont want that.
neutral	No, so were protecting her.
neutral	But we should take it.
non-neutral	But we should move quick.
surprise	Why?
non-neutral	Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
fear	Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
neutral	Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
neutral	Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
neutral	Well, you're gonna.
neutral	I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
neutral	Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
neutral	Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.
non-neutral	And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?
neutral	Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
neutral	Hey, you're not him.
neutral	You're you.
neutral	When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
neutral	No.
neutral	No.
neutral	You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.
non-neutral	Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!
neutral	And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
non-neutral	You really think so?
neutral	Yeah. I really do.
neutral	Thanks, Chandler.
non-neutral	Get off!
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
neutral	When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
neutral	And the cream?
neutral	Cheese makes me thirsty.
neutral	Okay. Lets move on.
neutral	All right.
surprise	Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! Youve never made this before?
surprise	Oh no!
neutral	I dont know anything about cooking.
neutral	I had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
joy	Well, hats off to the chef.
neutral	I-I-Im sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didnt hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
joy	The chef!
joy	Thats right.
neutral	Hey, Pheebs.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	How's it going?
non-neutral	Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
neutral	So what's going on?
neutral	Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
neutral	I dunno, there's just something about...
neutral	Basically we just feel that he's...
disgust	We hate that guy.
disgust	Yeah. Hate him.
sadness	We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
neutral	Uh-huh.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
disgust	...No, we hate him.
sadness	We're sorry.
joy	Hey!
joy	Hey!
neutral	What are you doing?
neutral	Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
non-neutral	Yes that was mine.
non-neutral	'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
non-neutral	Yes that would have made more sense.
anger	Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!
neutral	All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time.
neutral	And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.
non-neutral	Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?
surprise	!
non-neutral	Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
non-neutral	Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
surprise	She said what?
neutral	She said, "If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
non-neutral	Postpone it?
non-neutral	Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?
non-neutral	Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?
neutral	This isnt right.
non-neutral	I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure theyll come back when we can do it right.
non-neutral	I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
anger	Dont you point your pants at me!
anger	We have no choice!
non-neutral	Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross dont you understand?
non-neutral	This is our wedding Im talking about.
neutral	The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when were getting married.
non-neutral	So what are you saying? Its now or never?
neutral	No. Im saying its now.
non-neutral	Or?
non-neutral	Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
non-neutral	Its not the pants.
non-neutral	Its you that is backwards.
anger	And if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all!
sadness	No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please
neutral	Hi, honey.
neutral	See you later.
non-neutral	What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
anger	Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
neutral	Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller.
surprise	Oh no!
neutral	I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
non-neutral	Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!!
surprise	This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
anger	NOOOO!!!!!!!!
surprise	Ma! What're you doing here?
neutral	I came to give you this  and this.
surprise	Oww! Big ring!
neutral	Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
non-neutral	Do you uh, do you talk about me?
neutral	Yeah, yeah, all the time.
surprise	Really?
neutral	But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
disgust	Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
disgust	Have you ever seen so much crap?
non-neutral	Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
neutral	Check this out. Can I have this?
neutral	What?
neutral	I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.
neutral	All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.
non-neutral	It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
sadness	If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
joy	Fortunately, it is me.
joy	And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.
joy	Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate.
neutral	Y'know, someplace nice.
neutral	Yeah, someplace nice.
joy	Yeah!
non-neutral	How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
neutral	So, what do you think?
joy	I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
joy	I know!
neutral	So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
joy	Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
joy	Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!
surprise	Whats this?
neutral	Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
neutral	Gotcha.

non-neutral	No, Rachel doesnt want me to....

neutral	Yeah, youre right.
sadness	God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
sadness	Oh, I know.
sadness	I kinda feel like it's my fault.
anger	Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
anger	Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
non-neutral	Well, I think it's very brave what you said.

non-neutral	Is this because of the burrito thing?

non-neutral	No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
neutral	Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
neutral	You've got to be smooth about it.

neutral	No, Ive just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
neutral	I can blow dry it.
neutral	I can put gel on it.
neutral	It doesnt matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head.
disgust	Its so annoying.
non-neutral	Does it bug you?
disgust	You bug me.
neutral	Is there any chance you didnt see that?

anger	Hey-hey, yknow what?
anger	I dont care!
non-neutral	Im not ashamed of my book.
neutral	Theres nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a littleerotica.
non-neutral	Its just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
non-neutral	You got porn!
joy	Well, I feel like a snack!
neutral	Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are.
neutral	Oh no thanks. I dont like

anger	Come on!
non-neutral	I dont wanna make any mistakes, alright?
fear	This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?

joy	Okay, now you're even cuter!!
neutral	Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
surprise	What?
surprise	The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
surprise	What are you talking about?
joy	I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
non-neutral	That's not possible!
surprise	Ow!
non-neutral	I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
non-neutral	Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
sadness	I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
anger	No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!

surprise	Yeah? You like that one?
joy	Yeah, youre funny.
surprise	Im funny?

neutral	Umm, oh hereDo you want a good one?
neutral	Heres a good one.
neutral	Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge.
neutral	Right?
neutral	And then you say to person, I bet you cant roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face.
neutral	And then when they do it, theyre left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
neutral	Can I do it to you?
non-neutral	Yeah, I-I-I-Im funny Ben, but Im not stupid. Okay?

neutral	Yeah, they still wear underwear.
neutral	So the Porsche guy took his car back.
neutral	But you found the keys to his clothes?
non-neutral	No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
surprise	And people will think you own a Porsche because youre wearing the clothes?
surprise	Really?!
non-neutral	Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.

disgust	It made me nuts.
neutral	You or me?
non-neutral	I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.

__label__neutral I dont know.  Let me see the ring.
__label__joy Great! Okay, here.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__joy Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  And
__label__neutral What've you been up to?
__label__neutral Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much.
__label__neutral Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
__label__joy Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__neutral I'm back.
__label__neutral So, are we gonna get together or what?
__label__neutral Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
__label__neutral Great, I'll see you then.
__label__joy Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
__label__neutral Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."
__label__neutral I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
__label__disgust Oh my god. You are pure evil.
__label__non-neutral Ok, pure evil , horny and alone . I've done this
__label__anger Nobody!
__label__anger Nobody respects the bucket!
__label__non-neutral You wouldn't believe what people put in here!
__label__anger Look!
__label__anger Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral This is my wedding.
__label__non-neutral All right, yknow what? We really are late! Lets go! Lets go! Lets go!!
__label__neutral Fine. Youll-youll watch it on video when we get back.
__label__joy Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__joy All right, lets go! Bye, Pheebs!
__label__joy Bye, Pheebs!
__label__joy London baby!!
__label__joy Oh, do you need a hug? You dont have to bring me anything!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__joy Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and Ill have my health insurance back in no time.
__label__non-neutral Thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now?
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral Whats wrong with you?
__label__neutral Nothing!
__label__fear Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.
__label__neutral But um, I dont think its anything serious.
__label__surprise This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor!
__label__fear No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
__label__non-neutral Thats a hernia.
__label__anger Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!
__label__joy I love your place! Where is this guy from?
__label__neutral Uh thats an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
__label__surprise Oh wow! So, youre more than just dinosaurs.
__label__neutral So much more.
__label__neutral Well, well to sum up, were having fun, you look young.
__label__neutral Okay
__label__neutral But thats not enough. So Soheres a key to my apartment.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Really.
__label__neutral You dont think this is too fast.
__label__anger Get Out!
__label__neutral Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
__label__neutral Yes, please!  So, what's going on?
__label__sadness Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
__label__surprise Oh my God, wh-what happened?
__label__sadness Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
__label__non-neutral I knew that was him!
__label__sadness Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
__label__neutral Hey, you ok?
__label__sadness I guess.
__label__neutral There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey.
__label__neutral I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else.
__label__neutral Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
__label__neutral Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
__label__neutral Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?
__label__non-neutral Or we could throw you both in
__label__anger Ok, gentlemen!
__label__anger Please!
__label__anger Aren't we a little old for this?
__label__non-neutral I mean, we're scientists, right?
__label__non-neutral We're academics.
__label__joy And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first.
__label__neutral .
__label__joy GO, GO, GO!
__label__joy Go, go, go!
__label__joy Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
__label__non-neutral Oy!!
__label__surprise Whats with all this sand?
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
__label__neutral Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
__label__anger Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
__label__joy Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
__label__neutral If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
__label__neutral Rach? What are you doing?
__label__fear Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
__label__neutral It's a diaper commercial.
__label__fear Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
__label__joy Pizza delivery!
__label__joy I'll get it! I will get that!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
__label__neutral Uhh, the ball thing.
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__joy Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
__label__neutral Uhh,
__label__joy Okay!
__label__fear Uh-oh.
__label__neutral What?
__label__non-neutral I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
__label__surprise Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
__label__fear I know!  Don't switch hands, okay?
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral How did it go with Erin?
__label__joy Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
__label__joy Yay!! Oh so, youre not, youre not mad at us anymore?
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__joy You guys were totally right!
__label__joy This is so much better than the first time we went out.
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__neutral That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
__label__neutral Didnt you sleep together?
__label__neutral Yeah, that really calms me down.
__label__non-neutral And!
__label__joy We have so much in common!
__label__non-neutral She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if we were ever to have kids, well thats a
__label__surprise Oh my God! Listen to you talkin about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please dont get married before I do.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__surprise How does she do that?
__label__neutral I cannot sleep in a public place.
__label__non-neutral Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
__label__surprise Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
__label__neutral It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
__label__surprise What's going on with you?
__label__anger I got no sleep last night!
__label__neutral Why?
__label__disgust My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed.
__label__neutral Oh, and deaf.
__label__neutral So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time.
__label__disgust You have no idea how loud they are!
__label__neutral Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
__label__joy Thanks.
__label__disgust Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
__label__neutral It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
__label__surprise Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
__label__neutral Breathe, breathe, breathe.
__label__surprise Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually going to kill you dead.
__label__non-neutral Okay! You dont think I thought of that?
__label__surprise How can you not know which one?
__label__non-neutral I mean thats unbelievable.
__label__neutral I mean, was it Gina?
__label__neutral Which one is Gina?
__label__neutral Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
__label__neutral No, no, no, thats Dina.
__label__surprise You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!!
__label__neutral I dont know, you thought See you Saturday was funny.
__label__neutral Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with.
__label__neutral You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
__label__joy Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
__label__surprise Really!?
__label__neutral Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out.
__label__neutral I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
__label__joy Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What?
__label__fear What should I wear, now Im all nervous.
__label__joy : I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
__label__joy I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
__label__joy : Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.
__label__non-neutral Oh well, okay, good luck.
__label__neutral : Yeah.
__label__neutral Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
__label__neutral : Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think Im ready to dance with girls.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral : Yeah.
__label__neutral Go get em Treeger.
__label__neutral : Right.  Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral : Yeah, you could dance real good with her, shes the same size as me.
__label__neutral No, Im good.
__label__non-neutral Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
__label__neutral Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so
__label__surprise Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
__label__neutral Who knows?
__label__neutral Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
__label__joy Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!
__label__joy Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Actually, that can't happen.
__label__neutral Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
__label__neutral So it'll be either you two  or you two.
__label__non-neutral Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
__label__neutral Yeah, it is.
__label__neutral No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
__label__non-neutral Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
__label__joy Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
__label__non-neutral Please!
__label__non-neutral Are you kidding?
__label__non-neutral I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody noseI mean I-Im not proud of it but, I really am.
__label__joy And its all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
__label__fear I think youve got concussion.
__label__joy No, no, Im serious. Thank you.
__label__fear Youre welcome.  Im sorry. Did I hurt you?
__label__non-neutral Its worth the pain.  Yknow what, you know what? Its not.
__label__surprise Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
__label__non-neutral I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do"  "I do".
__label__neutral Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
__label__joy David is going to propose to Phoebe.
__label__surprise What?  Why?
__label__non-neutral Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
__label__anger Chandler, we have talked about this.
__label__anger You are not supposed to give people advice!
__label__non-neutral Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
__label__neutral I
__label__anger They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!
__label__non-neutral She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone
__label__non-neutral Man, that's some
__label__neutral Oh, that's not what you want...
__label__neutral This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
__label__joy It-its great to meet you Paul.
__label__neutral I usually prefer Elizabeths boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
__label__neutral Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
__label__anger So Ross, what your problem?
__label__surprise Eh-whExcuse me?
__label__anger Why cant you get a girlfriend your own age?
__label__fear Thats funny. Umm.  Its not funny.
__label__neutral I
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral I can, I can see that.
__label__fear Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral What?
__label__anger Okay. Ill give you one chance to change my mind.  You got one minute.
__label__surprise Daddy!
__label__neutral Oh well, its not on TV yet.
__label__neutral Well, then its not on the wall yet.
__label__neutral Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
__label__neutral So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauers clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that havent been cleaned yet?
__label__surprise Ooooohh!
__label__neutral Oh yeah, I'm sure.  And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
__label__surprise Was it...?
__label__neutral Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
__label__surprise "Ooo," what?
__label__neutral Uma Thurman.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__surprise The actress!
__label__neutral Thanks Rach.
__label__surprise So what are you gonna do?
__label__joy You have to tell her!
__label__joy You have to tell her!
__label__non-neutral It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue!
__label__non-neutral Guys?
__label__non-neutral Guys?
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
__label__neutral Feminist issue. That's where I went!
__label__fear She is gonna hate me.
__label__neutral Yeah, well...
__label__non-neutral Will you marry me?
__label__joy Its the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
__label__neutral Yeah, right here in my pocket.  Pheebs?
__label__surprise Oh! Oop!
__label__neutral Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and shes gonna know.
__label__neutral Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
__label__neutral Hi guys.
__label__joy You are beautiful.
__label__joy Oh, thank you!   Whats going on?
__label__neutral Were just reallyvery excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
__label__neutral Okay umm, Ross?
__label__neutral I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater.
__label__neutral Now, I'm just letting you know that this is
__label__joy Yep! That's hilarious!
__label__neutral I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
__label__neutral Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
__label__neutral No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
__label__neutral Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
__label__neutral Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
__label__surprise What?! You totally get embarrassed!
__label__neutral No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
__label__neutral Is that so?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__disgust Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am
__label__surprise I cant believe it!
__label__joy I did it!
__label__joy I rode a bike!
__label__joy I never thought Id be able to do that!
__label__joy Thank you Ross.
__label__joy Oh hey, dont thank me, thank yourself. Youre the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
__label__non-neutral Well yeah, but then
__label__non-neutral YeahNo-but-but-but-but! Were just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, thats not scary right?
__label__neutral Depends on what you mean by we.
__label__neutral Hey, both you guys should be up there with me.
__label__neutral I mean, you two are-are my I mean, Im lucky to have just one good
__label__neutral Thanks man.
__label__neutral I gotta go check something over here.
__label__non-neutral What a baby.
__label__non-neutral Total wuss!
__label__neutral David?
__label__joy Phoebe! Hi!
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__joy Wow, you look unbelievable.
__label__surprise Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
__label__non-neutral Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.
__label__surprise What happened?
__label__neutral Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__sadness Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.
__label__joy Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
__label__non-neutral Good, good, life is good...
__label__joy Good!
__label__non-neutral Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
__label__neutral Oh, good for you.
__label__non-neutral She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that".
__label__sadness Mike and I broke up.
__label__sadness It means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us.
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__sadness I'm sorry.
__label__sadness I'm sorry too.
__label__non-neutral Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
__label__non-neutral I know.
__label__neutral Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
__label__joy Wow! This looks great!
__label__non-neutral Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap.  Umm, this one is made of bologna.
__label__non-neutral And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
__label__non-neutral You kissed another woman!
__label__neutral Call it even?!
__label__non-neutral Okay!
__label__neutral Well, Im gonna go get these  in some water.
__label__surprise Wait you stole those from these peoples wedding?
__label__neutral No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby.
__label__anger Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__surprise My sweater!
__label__surprise Ive been looking for this for like a month!
__label__surprise Oh my God!!
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy?
__label__anger Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be!
__label__surprise Huh?
__label__anger Because I sure as hell cant figure it out!
__label__non-neutral I talk to you and nothin.
__label__non-neutral You look at me, and its nothin.
__label__non-neutral Nothing.
__label__joy Tasty! Im really starting to feel like you guys have a history, its-its nice.
__label__neutral I have a question about this scene.
__label__neutral Yes?
__label__non-neutral Well, I dont understand why Adriennes attracted to Victor.
__label__neutral Peel the onion. First of all, hes good looking.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral I think my characters gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
__label__neutral Oh, hey, how about this one.
__label__non-neutral Ah, its says so in the script!
__label__non-neutral Y'know ah, I-I dont know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that youre a bitch.
__label__anger It doesnt say that in the script.
__label__non-neutral It does in mine!
__label__non-neutral I cant
__label__non-neutral Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
__label__neutral Yknow who has a great video camera?
__label__neutral Greg and Jenny?
__label__neutral Do you still wanna call em? I wanna call em.
__label__neutral Lets call em.
__label__joy Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
__label__neutral Hello?  Eighth street deli?
__label__disgust Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin to that place.
__label__non-neutral Uh sorry, wrong number.
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__surprise Hello?   Its the deli again!
__label__joy All right! Ill have a sandwich!
__label__non-neutral I dont think this numbers right!
__label__non-neutral Oh come on!!
__label__sadness Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
__label__surprise Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?
__label__neutral Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
__label__neutral Sure. So how long you been...
__label__neutral Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
__label__surprise Since then?!
__label__neutral No, it's only been six years.
__label__neutral I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy.
__label__neutral ...Joe.
__label__neutral Y'ever been in love?
__label__neutral ...I d'know.
__label__neutral Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
__label__disgust You're one to talk.
__label__neutral Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
__label__non-neutral Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
__label__surprise Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
__label__neutral Everythings gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
__label__surprise Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  Thats supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
__label__neutral Hey, Rach, how was work?
__label__neutral Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasnt a chair.
__label__neutral By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
__label__neutral Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming.
__label__neutral Im just gonna throw it out, its probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
__label__neutral Something wrong?
__label__neutral No. Nothing.
__label__neutral And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
__label__surprise Yeah, that's it?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy Yess!!
__label__joy We're teeth people Zack!
__label__sadness Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
__label__non-neutral No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name!
__label__neutral Its not that bad.
__label__non-neutral Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
__label__neutral So, youre just Bing?
__label__joy Because we won our apartment back!
__label__surprise What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
__label__non-neutral No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
__label__surprise I dont know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it!  Ah-ha!
__label__neutral All right, cut, lets pick again, pick again.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Come on apartment! Come on apartment!  Oh! I know queen is high!
__label__surprise Uh-huh, not as high as It worked! King!
__label__joy Yeah baby!
__label__joy But, we pick again! We pick again!
__label__neutral Why?!
__label__non-neutral I dont know!
__label__joy Tickets please!  Thats courtside baby!
__label__surprise Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
__label__non-neutral No they didnt!
__label__neutral You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
__label__neutral It's gonna be worth it.
__label__neutral It's a known fact that women love babies, all right?
__label__neutral Women love guys who love babies.
__label__neutral It's that whole sensitive thing.
__label__neutral Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there.
__label__neutral Maybe one of them will break away.
__label__non-neutral No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left.
__label__neutral All right, gimme the baby.
__label__neutral No, I got him.
__label__non-neutral No, seriously.
__label__surprise Oh, seriously you want him?
__label__neutral Hello.
__label__surprise Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
__label__neutral You wanna smell him?
__label__joy Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
__label__non-neutral What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
__label__neutral Well, we are great guys.
__label__neutral Bye.
__label__neutral Well, not really.
__label__neutral I mean technically its-its not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.
__label__non-neutral Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
__label__non-neutral Well Ross, you be careful now. You dont want to get a reputation as yknow Professor McNailshisstudents.
__label__non-neutral Yeah. What-what should I do?
__label__neutral Well Ross, it seems pretty clear.
__label__neutral I mean whats more important?
__label__neutral What people think or how you feel, huh?
__label__neutral Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
__label__joy Joey that is so sweet.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
__label__sadness I couldnt do it.
__label__surprise You couldnt do it?!
__label__neutral Hey, relax I just need more time. Were going to dinner tonight.
__label__surprise What?! Youre going out with her again!
__label__neutral Going out with who?
__label__neutral Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
__label__surprise Oh yeah! Wasnt she uh
__label__neutral No, that was Dana Caplin.
__label__surprise Joey! You didnt even know her!
__label__non-neutral Ah whatever!
__label__joy Morning! Hey, hows my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
__label__anger Dont touch him!
__label__surprise Okay!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Umm, all right Wayne, level with me.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__fear I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired.
__label__non-neutral Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part!
__label__non-neutral Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance!
__label__non-neutral I mean, I love-I love this little guy!
__label__surprise Ah-ah!!
__label__surprise Okay, thats why you didnt want me to touch him right?
__label__neutral Here you go!
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__anger Stupid!
__label__surprise I cant believe it!
__label__anger God!
__label__neutral Hey, how you doin?
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
__label__neutral No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
__label__non-neutral I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
__label__anger For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
__label__anger You had no
__label__anger Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
__label__anger But I told you, I didnt have the time!
__label__anger Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
__label__anger Wh, Ross what do you want from me?
__label__anger You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
__label__neutral I know.
__label__non-neutral Ooh, I have to tell you something.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral But I cant tell you.
__label__neutral Okay, but wouldnt it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
__label__neutral Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldnt tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
__label__neutral Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Does it have to do with Joey?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
__label__neutral No, but lets come back to that later!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Richard!
__label__neutral Actually, Im not here to complement the chef.
__label__neutral Ohh Oh, thats okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef.
__label__neutral Like I have nothing better to do!
__label__neutral So whats up?
__label__joy Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
__label__neutral Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
__label__joy No! I came here to tell you something else.  I came here  to tell you I still love you.
__label__non-neutral One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
__label__non-neutral So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
__label__anger Maybe!  Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it! I cant!
__label__fear Joey, I am scared to death about this.
__label__fear But I really think I can do it, Im just gonna need some help.
__label__neutral And Bobbys gonna be here the whole time.
__label__joy You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, were straight-up gangster rap.
__label__anger Look, Rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her. Why cant you do that for me?
__label__non-neutral Because! Cause Cause youre my baby sister!
__label__joy And youre my big brother!
__label__neutral I mean, youre my favorite guy in the whole world.
__label__neutral Im not even scared to tell mom and dad.
__label__fear I was scared of telling you.
__label__non-neutral Well Id be scared of them, but all right.
__label__sadness Joey, I cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.
__label__sadness I want him to have his uncle.
__label__sadness Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
__label__joy Of course hes gonna have his Uncle Joey!
__label__joy Were gonna be all right. I mean, even if were not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
__label__joy Thats right! By his uncle too!
__label__joy And by you.
__label__neutral Okay Bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have a little moment.
__label__non-neutral Come here!
__label__non-neutral No! Seriously! Whats wrong with you?!
__label__joy I had a really nice time tonight.
__label__joy So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
__label__neutral I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
__label__surprise You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch?  Ohhh! I saw
__label__neutral Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__surprise Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
__label__neutral Like it would help.
__label__non-neutral You are so bad!
__label__non-neutral You are!
__label__non-neutral You are!
__label__non-neutral You are!
__label__non-neutral You are!
__label__non-neutral You are!
__label__non-neutral You are!
__label__non-neutral You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
__label__neutral Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
__label__surprise Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
__label__neutral Hi Mom, it's Jill.
__label__surprise She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!
__label__neutral Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
__label__neutral Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
__label__neutral I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
__label__joy Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was
__label__non-neutral I say, Drew!
__label__neutral Are you seeing anybody right now?
__label__non-neutral Og-ee-op, Im not asking for me, Im I mean No, Im-Im not gay, Im not asking you out.
__label__non-neutral Im not-Im not-Im not gay!
__label__neutral Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__non-neutral That sounds great!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You cant eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
__label__surprise Theres gravy?
__label__neutral If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time.
__label__neutral That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, thats your department now.
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral I think I left a donut up here.
__label__neutral So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so Im happy.
__label__joy Great job team!
__label__neutral Tomorrow at 8:30.
__label__non-neutral Phil!
__label__joy Nice job.
__label__non-neutral Stevens!
__label__joy Way to go!
__label__joy Joel-burg, you maniac!
__label__joy I love ya!
__label__joy Bing!
__label__joy Good job, couldnt have done it without ya.
__label__neutral Thank you, sir.
__label__neutral Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.
__label__non-neutral Of course, you did.
__label__non-neutral Forgot something else too ya bastard!
__label__neutral Well, what about you?
__label__neutral Youre not feeling left out or anything are ya?
__label__non-neutral No. No, not at all, thats-thats ridiculous.
__label__non-neutral Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Dont you?
__label__sadness Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
__label__non-neutral Now get on out of here, you!
__label__neutral Hey Bob.
__label__joy Hey! Hows my pal Toby doing today?
__label__neutral If I see him, Ill ask.
__label__joy Toby!
__label__non-neutral Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Oh then you know each other.
__label__neutral Were on a semi-first name basis.
__label__neutral What do you think of adding him to our team?
__label__non-neutral Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know if he has what it takes.
__label__surprise Really? They love him down on six.
__label__neutral But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here.
__label__joy Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
__label__neutral A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
__label__joy No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans tux!
__label__surprise What?
__label__joy Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat Batman film he was in.
__label__anger You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James Bonds tux!
__label__neutral So?
__label__sadness SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.
__label__non-neutral Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say "I do," hes thinking, "Yeah, Id do her too!"
__label__neutral Well then we still have a problem.
__label__neutral Yeah!
__label__neutral With what?
__label__neutral Well, were trying to find someone to perform our wedding and theyre all either boring or annoying or yknow, cant stop staring at the ladies.
__label__joy Oo! You should have one of us do it!
__label__neutral Phoebe, were getting
__label__joy No! No! Its-its uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
__label__surprise Are you serious?
__label__joy Yes! A friend of mine did it and its totally legal!
__label__joy I call it!!
__label__anger What?! No! It was my idea!
__label__neutral Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
__label__anger Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
__label__neutral We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
__label__joy See, I see.... big passion in your future.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral I do.
__label__joy Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
__label__non-neutral It's never gonna happen.
__label__non-neutral Everybody knows!
__label__neutral That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why.
__label__neutral Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldnt sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
__label__neutral Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
__label__neutral Yeah, I wouldve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
__label__surprise What?!?!
__label__neutral Okay, this is what Im talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
__label__neutral You can spill. In the sink.
__label__sadness Aw, honey its not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I dont see that happening.
__label__joy I love you, too.
__label__non-neutral Aww, good.  What?
__label__sadness What? Im just said.
__label__neutral No youre not, youre wondering which cushion it is.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Are you serious?!
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__joy I would love to live with you Ross; thats-thats great! Thank you!
__label__neutral Well, Im-Im just glad I could, yknow, help you out.
__label__non-neutral Wow! Im-Im so happy for you guys.  This is so-so, not stupid.
__label__joy Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me!
__label__sadness I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.
__label__joy You just saved me!
__label__joy Youre my hero!
__label__neutral Hero, I uh, I dont knowwell, all right.
__label__joy Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
__label__non-neutral Oh please!   Youre gonna say things now, arent ya?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral No, I wont.
__label__neutral But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise.
__label__non-neutral She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!
__label__non-neutral And thats how she ended up living with me!
__label__neutral Okay, thats a lie.
__label__disgust Ugh!!
__label__neutral What happened?
__label__neutral I ended up at Ross's place.
__label__neutral Oh, I musta missed counted or something.
__label__anger Damn!
__label__non-neutral She's not there anymore.
__label__neutral Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
__label__neutral No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
__label__non-neutral ...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?
__label__joy Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
__label__neutral Lose the robe.
__label__surprise Me?
__label__joy That's great.
__label__neutral Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
__label__neutral No, no, I'm still working on mine.
__label__surprise That's it?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, it was really hard.
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
__label__non-neutral Ok, you weren't there.
__label__joy Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice!
__label__neutral Pretty nice?
__label__neutral Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
__label__neutral We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weve got a canoe.
__label__neutral Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe.
__label__non-neutral You gotta take the canoe!
__label__neutral All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
__label__anger Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
__label__non-neutral Good for you!!
__label__neutral Pheebs?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
__label__surprise One ticket to Yemen?
__label__neutral Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
__label__surprise Im sorry sir, I dont understand.
__label__neutral What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
__label__neutral Are you travelling with a child?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral All right, yknow what, shes  gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card.
__label__non-neutral Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we dont take library cards.
__label__non-neutral Whats the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
__label__neutral Okay, but this is the last time.
__label__joy With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there.
__label__joy Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hows she doing?
__label__surprise She?
__label__non-neutral Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she?
__label__neutral I dont know.  I cant tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
__label__neutral Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
__label__non-neutral Excuse me?
__label__neutral What?
__label__non-neutral Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
__label__neutral Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
__label__neutral Well sensitive is important, pick him.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__disgust Oh sure, go with the sissy.
__label__anger Jason is not a sissy!
__label__non-neutral Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesnt matter.
__label__neutral I mean, I think it wouldve happened either way.
__label__neutral I mean if you hadnt initiated it I-I-I know I wouldve.
__label__joy It was an amazing night.
__label__joy It was. It was an amazing night.
__label__non-neutral You think it looked amazing?
__label__neutral Do we have a name yet?
__label__neutral No, not yet.
__label__neutral Thats fine, for now well just call her Baby Girl Green.
__label__neutral Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
__label__joy Hello baby girl.
__label__non-neutral Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
__label__non-neutral I dont like sitting up here! Im just gonna over
__label__non-neutral No Rachel! They got here first!
__label__neutral Why is Ross doing that?
__label__fear DANGER
__label__surprise Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
__label__neutral No thats all right. Dont worry about it.
__label__disgust Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain!
__label__non-neutral Rach! Hey! Its fine! Youre at Joeys!
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Yeah! Look!
__label__non-neutral Ive never lived like this before.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__neutral All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food.
__label__neutral Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
__label__joy I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen    Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
__label__surprise Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support    you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so
__label__neutral Also so
__label__neutral Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
__label__neutral Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff!
__label__neutral OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
__label__neutral About what?
__label__neutral He's planning your birthday party.
__label__joy Oh my God! I love him!
__label__fear You'd better act surprised.
__label__neutral About what?
__label__joy My surprise party!
__label__surprise What surprise party?
__label__non-neutral Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
__label__neutral Well, he didn't tell me.
__label__neutral Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
__label__anger This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
__label__neutral No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
__label__anger Yuh-huh!
__label__non-neutral I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.
__label__non-neutral I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.
__label__surprise Looks like I was second to last.
__label__neutral Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad.
__label__neutral Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an invitation.
__label__anger Chandler! Hes your father; he should be at the wedding.
__label__disgust I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I havent seen him in years.
__label__non-neutral Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!
__label__non-neutral Well he doesnt have to know!
__label__neutral Its not like we run in the same circles.
__label__disgust I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
__label__neutral Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
__label__non-neutral Trust me, you dont want him there either.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__disgust Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
__label__neutral So what! As long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil I dont care.
__label__neutral Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
__label__neutral Hello! Whos in there?
__label__neutral How ya doin?
__label__non-neutral Who in the hell are you?
__label__neutral I guess you wouldnt believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
__label__fear No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us!
__label__non-neutral No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
__label__non-neutral Im not gonna marry Chandler!
__label__anger Not after this!
__label__neutral Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo.
__label__neutral I gotta go.
__label__non-neutral Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
__label__neutral Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral So Pheebs, what is the book about?
__label__neutral I thought you said you read it in high school.
__label__neutral Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm, what is this book about?
__label__neutral Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?
__label__neutral Y'know what, actually  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
__label__non-neutral I thought you didn't smoke.
__label__neutral Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?
__label__neutral Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?
__label__surprise And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!"
__label__neutral But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
__label__neutral We get high.
__label__neutral Oh, me too.
__label__neutral I'm kidding.
__label__non-neutral Oh, me too.
__label__non-neutral Oh, are you sure you're ok?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__sadness Does it still hurt?
__label__sadness Yeah.
__label__non-neutral What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hey, how'd it go?
__label__joy Excellent.
__label__joy We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
__label__non-neutral What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
__label__neutral You know what? You are right. I
__label__joy Good for you Pheebs!
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__neutral Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean
__label__anger This sucks! I didnt know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! Im so tired!
__label__neutral Its 6:00.
__label__neutral Yeah, well
__label__joy Hi!
__label__non-neutral Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think thats, I think thats really cool.
__label__neutral Yeah, Rach, I think youre handling that really well.
__label__neutral Handling it?
__label__non-neutral What do you mean, handling it?
__label__non-neutral Theres nothing to handle.
__label__neutral Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasnt for me and Joshua.
__label__anger Yknow, theyre not gonna get married anyway!
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral Come on!
__label__disgust They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous!
__label__non-neutral I mean, theyre gonna be engaged for like what?
__label__non-neutral A year?
__label__neutral And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what theyve done and theyre call the whole thing off.
__label__joy Im telling ya, youre gonna be dancing at my wedding before youre dancing at theres.
__label__surprise What the hell is this?!
__label__anger What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I cant use for another two months?!
__label__anger This sucks!
__label__neutral All right, whats my next present?
__label__non-neutral !
__label__neutral All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
__label__neutral Ennnh.
__label__neutral Ive got canned goods.
__label__surprise Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
__label__neutral Excellent hole, Joe.
__label__surprise Oh no! No!! My hole!!
__label__non-neutral Ow!! Ow!!!
__label__surprise What?! What?!! What is it?!
__label__neutral My drinking?
__label__neutral Oh, I mustve said that after you left.
__label__non-neutral Said what? Exactly.
__label__neutral That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge.
__label__disgust Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible person!
__label__fear Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!!
__label__anger If youre gonna get all sensitive about it!
__label__sadness I dont want to lose you.
__label__neutral What if I, create a position for you?
__label__neutral Ill make you an assistant buyer in this department.
__label__joy Say more things like that.
__label__non-neutral You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
__label__neutral Id need an expense account.
__label__joy Done!
__label__neutral And an assistant.
__label__joy Sophie, get in here!
__label__joy Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
__label__surprise Oh my!
__label__neutral They're male nurses.
__label__neutral Not in my head.
__label__joy Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
__label__non-neutral Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise What are you talking about?!
__label__non-neutral You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.
__label__neutral I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me.
__label__neutral Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
__label__neutral Umm, why don't you give
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
__label__neutral Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some
__label__neutral Yep! There's always room for
__label__neutral Joey, how do you make
__label__neutral Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh,  Grandma's chicken salad
__label__neutral Hello, this is Monica...
__label__neutral Yeah???
__label__neutral Oh...
__label__neutral Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral Okay. Lets bring it in.
__label__neutral Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__anger That almost hit me in the face.
__label__non-neutral A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so cliché. Why don't you get a magician?!
__label__neutral Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
__label__joy Oh boy, me too!
__label__neutral Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
__label__non-neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
__label__non-neutral The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
__label__joy Thats me! Come on!
__label__neutral Okay.  But wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch.
__label__neutral Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.

__label__neutral Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.
__label__neutral Y'know?
__label__neutral You can take it off.
__label__non-neutral Just slice that baby right off!
__label__neutral Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing?
__label__neutral Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
__label__neutral Well that's not a third nipple.
__label__surprise No?
__label__neutral First of all, it's on your ass.
__label__surprise Well then, what is it?!
__label__neutral Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?

__label__neutral Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
__label__neutral Do you all promise?
__label__non-neutral Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
__label__neutral Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
__label__non-neutral You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
__label__neutral Hey, Pheebs.
__label__neutral 'Dear Ms. Buffay.
__label__neutral Thank you for calling attention to our error.
__label__neutral We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.
__label__neutral We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -
__label__neutral Bye bye.
__label__neutral Yes?
__label__neutral Whatcha doin'?
__label__neutral Ooh.
__label__neutral Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the
__label__neutral Honey, both yours.
__label__joy Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
__label__neutral Yeah? The work problem?
__label__joy Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
__label__neutral What problem did you tell him you had?
__label__neutral Oh thats not important. The point is, I reallyI think everythings gonna be okay.
__label__neutral Okay, Ive got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
__label__disgust No thanks, Mom!
__label__non-neutral Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, cause Im pregnant.
__label__non-neutral Ha-ha, its not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
__label__joy Very good,  so good.
__label__joy I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
__label__sadness Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didnt call.
__label__non-neutral I mean youd think hed be worried about me not showing up at his club.
__label__non-neutral Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
__label__non-neutral Come on! Look where you are!!
__label__neutral When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
__label__neutral Remember, a virgin for me please.
__label__neutral Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
__label__neutral Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy.
__label__neutral Well, if you think it will help.
__label__anger No!
__label__non-neutral That was a test!
__label__non-neutral In a couple of hours Im gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me!
__label__non-neutral And then after that, Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice
__label__non-neutral You should! How is she?
__label__anger Ohhh!!
__label__joy I think somebody needs another lap dance.
__label__neutral All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
__label__surprise You do?
__label__surprise You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman.
__label__non-neutral That and arrogance.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__joy Hey! How was sailing?
__label__joy Wow thanks!
__label__non-neutral Joe?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Uh, youve had a lot of sex right?
__label__surprise When? Today? Some, not a lot.
__label__fear Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt.
__label__fear There huhhmm, there-there was an incident.
__label__neutral Dont worry about that man, that happens.
__label__surprise Its happened to you?
__label__neutral Yeah! Once.
__label__surprise Well, whatd you do?
__label__neutral I did it anyway.
__label__neutral Sup? Sup dude?
__label__fear Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me.
__label__neutral So youre playing a little
__label__disgust Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
__label__surprise Come on man, really how old?!
__label__disgust Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
__label__surprise And they knew about it?
__label__surprise Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
__label__anger Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
__label__anger Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just dont know what the big deal is!
__label__non-neutral The big deal is I dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! Cold beer.
__label__neutral Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
__label__non-neutral Do you always have to bring him here?
__label__neutral I didn't wanna leave him alone.
__label__neutral Alright?
__label__neutral We- we had our first fight this morning.
__label__neutral I think it has to do with my working late.
__label__neutral I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
__label__neutral Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
__label__joy Oh, that'd be great!
__label__neutral Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
__label__neutral Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
__label__neutral All right, check it out.
__label__neutral Check this out.
__label__non-neutral It says here that theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!
__label__neutral "Its almost as good as being there."
__label__joy Its better! You cant go to a museum in your underwear!
__label__joy Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
__label__neutral Uh, may I help you?
__label__neutral Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, Im the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
__label__neutral Look, its like I told you, theres nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
__label__neutral All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
__label__anger Nobody sees the king!
__label__neutral Oh-ho-kay, Im talking to the king.
__label__surprise Hey! You cant go back there!
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh?
__label__neutral I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore.
__label__sadness Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a
__label__surprise Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
__label__neutral I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
__label__non-neutral No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says hes gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
__label__non-neutral Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea.
__label__neutral Oh. Look, just friends, I wont grope you. I promise.
__label__non-neutral No, I just I think that its too soon.
__label__neutral No its not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
__label__neutral I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
__label__surprise And now you want that money back.
__label__neutral Exactly.
__label__non-neutral Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
__label__non-neutral Its not a real game! I made it up!
__label__non-neutral Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
__label__neutral I don't know.
__label__neutral But I can see through your sheet.
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah, that's her.
__label__neutral But y'know what?
__label__sadness Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
__label__neutral Why?
__label__sadness Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
__label__surprise What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
__label__non-neutral No. No. No. She lives on the
__label__neutral No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby.
__label__neutral And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway.
__label__neutral You've been counting wrong.
__label__non-neutral I did
__label__non-neutral Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this.
__label__non-neutral Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
__label__surprise Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
__label__neutral No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
__label__non-neutral All right, lets do it.
__label__joy Come on!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral All right, gentlemen, youre up first.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round beginsstop it now. What was Monicas nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
__label__neutral Big fat goalie.
__label__neutral Correct. Rachel claims
__label__neutral Dangerous Liaisons
__label__neutral Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
__label__neutral Weekend at Bernies
__label__neutral Well, look, why dont you just, why dont you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
__label__joy Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
__label__non-neutral No you cant.
__label__non-neutral Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
__label__non-neutral You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long.
__label__anger Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__sadness Im sorry.
__label__surprise And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio.
__label__fear You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
__label__neutral Well, that shouldnt be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
__label__neutral Pete, can I get you something else?
__label__neutral Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if youre given em out.
__label__neutral Havent you and I covered that topic?
__label__neutral Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you.
__label__non-neutral Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
__label__non-neutral Well, if that were true, Id dating my Aunt Ruth.
__label__disgust And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.
__label__neutral Come on, you think she should go out with me, dont you?
__label__non-neutral Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?
__label__disgust I mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean.
__label__disgust That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
__label__neutral I mean really, think about it.
__label__neutral Ho-ho, I will.
__label__surprise I believe I read that somewhere!
__label__anger That only is not funny, it's physically impossible!
__label__non-neutral Ok?
__label__non-neutral Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...
__label__anger It's not funny!
__label__anger !
__label__neutral I respectfully disagree.
__label__anger I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
__label__neutral Who cares? Nobody reads those things
__label__non-neutral You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.
__label__neutral I don't have a page.
__label__non-neutral Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
__label__non-neutral I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
__label__surprise Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
__label__non-neutral No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
__label__disgust So, rocks.
__label__sadness I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
__label__joy Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?
__label__joy I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
__label__surprise Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
__label__sadness Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
__label__neutral You
__label__neutral Why?
__label__joy Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop.  Get up! Get up! Get up!
__label__non-neutral I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you dont think your son will think its yours and be horribly traumatised?
__label__non-neutral Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
__label__neutral Ohh, its time to go.
__label__non-neutral Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clocks a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes.
__label__neutral Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes?
__label__neutral Twice?
__label__neutral Well thats ambitious.
__label__neutral Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
__label__surprise Thats Carol with your son!
__label__joy Mornings here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the mornings here! The mornings here!
__label__non-neutral HEY!! Do you
__label__joy Oh come on! Mornings here!  Mornings here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
__label__neutral I
__label__joy Are you kidding? I love that guy!  Mornings here! Morning is here
__label__non-neutral Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
__label__neutral Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
__label__non-neutral Monica, you dont even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
__label__neutral Yknow what? I am
__label__sadness Im sorry. Im so sorry.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral See, this is a
__label__anger Shut up! This place is a hole!

__label__non-neutral Youre going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
__label__neutral Are you under the sheet?
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__joy Great, lets begin.  Hows the pressure?
__label__joy Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
__label__non-neutral Stating the obvious, but thank you. And its not weird is it.
__label__non-neutral No. Ooohh

__label__neutral Okay.
__label__joy Oh God Phoebe!!  Oh thats it! Thats it! Right there! Oh!  Ooooh-oooh-ooooh
__label__joy Hi!
__label__surprise Oh, Alice, hi!
__label__neutral Thanks.

__label__surprise Oh my God, who died on this?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I know. Its a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
__label__non-neutral Become a drama critic!
__label__non-neutral I am hurt!  A plague on both your houses!
__label__sadness By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
__label__disgust Oh, classy.
__label__non-neutral Yep! I sure know how to pick em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!
__label__non-neutral Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
__label__surprise Really. What?
__label__non-neutral Uh, de-clawing cats.
__label__neutral Hey, tell ya what.
__label__neutral Let me walk you home.
__label__non-neutral Well stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
__label__surprise Why the Post?
__label__surprise Oh, you didnt see the Post?
__label__neutral No. You?
__label__neutral No. Why?
__label__joy Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
__label__neutral Uhh, well Ive got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt.  You got an extra one?
__label__neutral Yeah, sure. Ummhere.
__label__non-neutral Great.  You got anything thats not
__label__neutral Yeah, I dont think so Joe.
__label__neutral All right, I guess this will be fine.
__label__neutral Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
__label__neutral Nothing, why?
__label__neutral How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? Ill pay.
__label__disgust Huh, Rach I got to say its gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
__label__neutral Im not asking you to go on a
__label__surprise Really? Cause I could kinda use the money.
__label__neutral Joey, just-just he-hes new in town and I know he doesnt have any guy friends.
__label__neutral Just take him to like a ball game or something.
__label__neutral Ill really appreciate it.
__label__neutral Yeah, okay.
__label__surprise Yeah?
__label__joy Sure, no problem.  OohHey, donuts!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Problem odour in the litter box? Dont change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
__label__sadness Sorry, Pheebs.

__label__sadness No! Really, no, please, please, thats, thats okay.
__label__non-neutral All right, all right, Im coming over, and Im bringing Chinese food.
__label__sadness Oh, yeah, Im not, Im not hungry.
__label__neutral Its for me.
__label__neutral Oh. Okay, bye.
__label__fear Come on, pick up, pick up!
__label__neutral Hello?
__label__neutral Transit Authority?
__label__neutral Yes, hello.
__label__neutral I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus.
__label__non-neutral Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid character.
__label__neutral Hi, here's the deal.
__label__neutral We lost a carseat on a bus today.
__label__neutral It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller.
__label__neutral Oh, and there was a baby in it.
__label__neutral He wants to talk to you again.
__label__neutral Hello.
__label__neutral Im sorry Im a little late.
__label__surprise AhWhoa!
__label__non-neutral A lot late.
__label__neutral Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller.
__label__neutral So to sum up, Im Professor Geller.
__label__non-neutral Good job today.
__label__neutral Good evening, sir.
__label__neutral My name is Ross Geller.
__label__neutral I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment.
__label__neutral And I-I realize that the competition is fierce butI'm sorry.
__label__non-neutral I, I can't help but notice you're naked and  I applaud you.
__label__neutral Man, I wish I was naked.
__label__joy I mean, this-this looks so great.
__label__neutral That is how God intended it.
__label__non-neutral Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship!
__label__non-neutral But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!
__label__joy Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest!
__label__non-neutral Okay, you go!
__label__surprise My turn? What-what are you talking about?
__label__disgust Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."
__label__neutral And he said, "Laundry?
__label__neutral Is
__label__non-neutral Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
__label__non-neutral Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
__label__neutral Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Bigot.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Mr. Bigot. He tells the most
__label__non-neutral All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
__label__surprise Me and Chandler?!
__label__neutral I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
__label__neutral Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
__label__non-neutral I don't know! I didn't come with her!
__label__joy All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
__label__surprise A test?!!
__label__joy Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah!  We should have essay questions!!
__label__neutral Okay Ive got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
__label__neutral Id have to saythe talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that youre making me eat him.
__label__surprise Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? Im sorry.
__label__neutral Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
__label__neutral I think its best sir.
__label__neutral But we really do need to find someone up here.
__label__neutral The work is starting to pile up.
__label__neutral Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high.
__label__neutral Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em.
__label__neutral Thats a good one.
__label__neutral What does a guy have to
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
__label__joy Hi, Julie!
__label__neutral Isnt there a national football league.
__label__neutral Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
__label__sadness Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
__label__joy Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
__label__neutral When theyre hungry enough, theyll come in.
__label__neutral Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
__label__neutral I dont know. You uh, you got something for me?
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
__label__neutral Ten. Okay. Now Tag theres such a thing as too many women.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__joy Yeah, for you!
__label__surprise Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God!
__label__neutral That's
__label__non-neutral Hey, I've been honing!
__label__non-neutral What was with the dishes?
__label__fear Oh, uh..
__label__fear I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know?
__label__non-neutral I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
__label__surprise Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
__label__anger Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!
__label__disgust Great, now he's waving back.
__label__disgust Man, we gotta do something about that guy.
__label__disgust This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment.
__label__non-neutral It creeps me out!
__label__anger I feel like I can't do stuff!
__label__non-neutral What kinda stuff?
__label__disgust Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
__label__surprise You cook naked?
__label__neutral Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
__label__surprise What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
__label__neutral Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
__label__non-neutral Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt called. Not that I even care, y'know.
__label__neutral Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to.
__label__anger You think you know me so well.
__label__neutral Well, dont cha wanna?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Okay, well I do know you.
__label__neutral Thats what I said.
__label__neutral Well so?
__label__sadness I cant.
__label__sadness I cant.
__label__sadness She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone.
__label__sadness Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like all my lives.
__label__neutral Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
__label__neutral Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
__label__neutral It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
__label__joy It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
__label__non-neutral Nuh-uh.
__label__non-neutral Yuh-huh.
__label__surprise So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
__label__disgust Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.
__label__surprise This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
__label__neutral No.
__label__non-neutral Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
__label__non-neutral Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my
__label__neutral There you go.
__label__non-neutral Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
__label__neutral That's the rule.
__label__anger What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
__label__non-neutral How'd you get to that?
__label__non-neutral Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
__label__surprise You knew about that?
__label__disgust Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
__label__neutral Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
__label__non-neutral What do you mean, like, buy it together?
__label__neutral Yeah
__label__non-neutral You think we're ready for something like that?
__label__neutral Why not?
__label__neutral Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
__label__non-neutral Why, are you moving out?
__label__neutral I'm not moving out.
__label__fear You'd tell me if you were moving out right
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
__label__non-neutral Aw, I know all about Kip!
__label__non-neutral It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
__label__non-neutral Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
__label__non-neutral Aw, don't do that
__label__non-neutral Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
__label__neutral Oh no, stay here well keep doing this. Ill pay you.
__label__neutral No, I got in trouble for that before. Ill see you later.
__label__joy Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss.
__label__non-neutral Oh my God! Oh my God! Im so sorry!
__label__neutral Aw forget it, its from
__label__anger You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! Im gonna kill you!!
__label__sadness Yknow this is actually not a great time for me.
__label__joy Okay! So, well just stay married.
__label__joy Yes, exactly!
__label__joy And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
__label__non-neutral Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Id have to talk you into this more.
__label__fear Okay, see now Im scared because I dont actually think youre kidding.
__label__non-neutral Im-Im not kidding. Look I-I, I cant have
__label__surprise What-wh-what so well just stay married forever?!
__label__neutral Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you?
__label__non-neutral Really?
__label__joy I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.!
__label__neutral Its
__label__sadness Ohh, okay, Im sorry.
__label__neutral Youre right.
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__non-neutral We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far
__label__neutral Im asking you to do me a favor.
__label__non-neutral You are asking me to be your wife!
__label__neutral And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral I know, I know, I'm such an idiot.
__label__non-neutral I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week.
__label__non-neutral I mean, how clean can teeth get?
__label__neutral My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
__label__neutral Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
__label__neutral -leg?
__label__neutral That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
__label__surprise You actually broke her watch?
__label__surprise Ooh, steer clear of you.
__label__neutral That's right.
__label__sadness Barry, I'm sorry...
__label__sadness I am so sorry...
__label__sadness I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...
__label__neutral No real-, honey, really its fine, just g-go with Susan.
__label__non-neutral Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea.
__label__neutral Okay, okay, bye
__label__neutral So what are they doing?
__label__non-neutral I dont know, something girlie.
__label__neutral Hey, youre early.
__label__surprise What are you doing with the lamp?
__label__neutral Im just taking it to be re-wired.
__label__disgust Oh, well dont take it to the same place you took the stereo, cause theyve had that thing for over a week.
__label__neutral No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
__label__anger Youre disturbing my oboe practice.
__label__non-neutral You dont play the oboe!
__label__anger I could play the oboe!
__label__joy Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
__label__joy Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
__label__anger All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
__label__surprise What is going on?
__label__anger What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!
__label__surprise Ross!
__label__anger I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!
__label__anger What do I have to do to get some service?!
__label__neutral Hi Rach.
__label__neutral Ross?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__joy Hey its Mona! From the wedding.
__label__joy Oh hi!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__surprise Wow! Uhhow are you?
__label__neutral Im good except umm, you still owe me a dance.
__label__non-neutral Oh thats right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
__label__surprise Oh youre serious. Sure!
__label__non-neutral Great! Well umm
__label__neutral I think I might need one more cup of coffee.
__label__neutral Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__sadness Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him.
__label__anger Go!
__label__surprise What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
__label__anger I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wont quit.
__label__neutral I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
__label__surprise Oh God Oh, hes in there right now?
__label__neutral Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
__label__non-neutral Uh, lets rip!
__label__surprise Really? Are you sure?
__label__joy Oh Phoebe!
__label__neutral Okay, sorry. Yeah.
__label__neutral Hey Rach.
__label__joy Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
__label__joy Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and    I wanted to share it with you.
__label__joy Oh, you're so wonderful.
__label__non-neutral Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period.
__label__non-neutral Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death    .
__label__non-neutral I think there are people in there having sex.
__label__neutral It can't be me, I'm standing right here.
__label__neutral Wanna peek?
__label__disgust No!
__label__surprise Come on!
__label__non-neutral Y'know what? I don't like you without mom.  Come on.
__label__non-neutral We're not peeking?
__label__surprise Well I'm peeking.  Oh my God!
__label__neutral Hello sir, you know Monica.
__label__joy Chandler is fantastic!!
__label__surprise What?!
__label__joy Oh God, we just clicked!
__label__joy Yknow how people just click?
__label__joy Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click!
__label__surprise Did he tell you?
__label__non-neutral Oh, I....
__label__joy Oh, and hes got such a good heart! Doesnt he have a good heart?
__label__non-neutral Oh, I know...
__label__joy Oh, I know and hes soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.
__label__joy Isnt this great?!
__label__neutral Dont spoil it.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__joy Hi, sweetie!
__label__neutral Hello.
__label__neutral Hi, Ross.
__label__neutral Yeah, huh.
__label__sadness Ive got some bad news.
__label__fear What?
__label__neutral I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
__label__non-neutral Come on sweetie! Youve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
__label__non-neutral Actually, its kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
__label__non-neutral But work comes first!  Oh hey, but thats sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
__label__neutral Nooo, hes leaving for a better job.
__label__non-neutral Oh well thats great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh?  Good bye.
__label__neutral Okay, then.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__sadness Well were gonna miss you around here.
__label__sadness Yeah, me too.
__label__neutral So, see ya on Saturday.
__label__neutral Yeah, you bet.
__label__neutral Whazzup??
__label__non-neutral Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
__label__neutral Listen, can you do me a favor?
__label__neutral I'm gonna be out today.
__label__neutral Can you    just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
__label__surprise You don't trust him?
__label__neutral I think the check in is that way.
__label__neutral Ahh.
__label__neutral Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
__label__non-neutral Well theres some people who do want to marry me.
__label__surprise There are?
__label__non-neutral Yeah! Richard!
__label__surprise R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?!
__label__neutral Thats right.
__label__neutral Chandler
__label__surprise You just told me that he hates marriage!
__label__non-neutral That-that hes a-a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife!
__label__non-neutral That-that hes against marriage and always will be!
__label__neutral You got
__label__fear You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
__label__neutral I knew.
__label__surprise You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
__label__neutral I did.
__label__sadness Oh.
__label__fear Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?
__label__neutral Sometime?
__label__neutral Maybe?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, maybe...
__label__joy Okay... okay, maybe I will...
__label__surprise Why?
__label__neutral Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
__label__joy Well, youre amazing.
__label__neutral Oh no-no-no.
__label__surprise A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
__label__non-neutral Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
__label__joy Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
__label__non-neutral Oh, I dont know.
__label__joy Oh-no-no-no, you are!
__label__joy You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that.
__label__neutral You mean with Casey.
__label__neutral No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes pretty cool.
__label__neutral Or Casey.
__label__neutral No-no, Kathy.
__label__neutral Could be Casey.
__label__neutral No. No, Kathy.
__label__neutral Consider Casey.
__label__non-neutral Yknow what I think?
__label__joy I think somebodys got a little crush on Casey.
__label__non-neutral How bout I fix you two up?
__label__non-neutral What do you think?
__label__joy That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
__label__neutral Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
__label__neutral Honey, whats the matter?
__label__neutral I just saw Janice.
__label__non-neutral Cause every time I see your face, I cant help but fall from grace. I know.....
__label__non-neutral Wow! This girl is good.
__label__non-neutral Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
__label__neutral I like her.
__label__neutral Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
__label__neutral Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from these people.
__label__non-neutral Look at you. All jealous.
__label__neutral Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, shes more.. y'know, and youre more
__label__neutral beside meeeee-eeee-ee. .
__label__non-neutral Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy shes done.
__label__neutral Okay, my next songs called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say.
__label__neutral I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldnt Have Left You That Way.
__label__neutral Oh no, one of those look for the hidden meaning songs.
__label__neutral Yes, hello.
__label__neutral I have a question.
__label__neutral Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.
__label__neutral A beard and a moustache.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral No,
__label__surprise What?! What else did he say?
__label__neutral Umm, he said he thought I was funny.
__label__neutral So Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
__label__non-neutral Ross, no! There is
__label__neutral Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
__label__non-neutral Ross, I am a human doodle!!
__label__neutral Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun!
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna
__label__neutral Okay, there was
__label__non-neutral Come on!
__label__non-neutral Oh wait, dont you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies?
__label__neutral No, its okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I dont
__label__neutral Oh yeah? Okay.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__surprise But! Dont you have to give him his money back?
__label__non-neutral Uh-huh.  Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you.  Okay, lets go see Monica!
__label__surprise Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
__label__neutral You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
__label__non-neutral So?!
__label__surprise Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade?
__label__non-neutral Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
__label__neutral Oh right, right.
__label__non-neutral I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
__label__surprise Well usually...yeah!
__label__neutral Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
__label__neutral Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me.
__label__sadness Im such a jerk.
__label__neutral Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
__label__joy Hmmm... this is so nice.
__label__neutral OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
__label__neutral OK.
__label__neutral OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
__label__surprise Ohhh!!!!
__label__neutral Yes, yes, that's right...
__label__surprise Oh, look at the little cat!
__label__surprise What?  Ow!
__label__neutral Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
__label__neutral I didn't mean
__label__non-neutral Why not?
__label__joy It's brilliant!
__label__joy Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!
__label__neutral well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding...
__label__neutral Thank you, Chandler.
__label__neutral Sincerely.
__label__joy Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
__label__non-neutral How do you think I should propose?
__label__neutral David, I'm pretending to
__label__joy Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  Come on Joey! You cant win if you dont ask any
__label__surprise What?!
__label__joy Well, you promised me a fun road trip!
__label__anger Weve been on the road six hours and youve been asleep for five and a half!
__label__non-neutral We are switching at the next rest stop and
__label__neutral All right. All right.
__label__non-neutral Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radios broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
__label__surprise Really? I dont
__label__anger Sing!!
__label__non-neutral Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
__label__joy Morning!
__label__joy Everything was delicious!
__label__joy Thank you!
__label__joy It was. The duck in particular was superb.
__label__joy Thank you!    You haven't said anything...
__label__neutral Actually I do have one small complaint.
__label__neutral Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
__label__non-neutral The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind    of a mood-killer!
__label__surprise What musician?
__label__neutral We did?
__label__non-neutral You owe me 20 bucks.
__label__joy Thank you. Thank you so much!
__label__neutral Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
__label__surprise Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?
__label__non-neutral What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
__label__neutral All right, I'm nine years old.
__label__non-neutral Oh, I hate this story.
__label__neutral We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
__label__sadness I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
__label__surprise Oh my god.
__label__sadness Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
__label__surprise Hey, who's this little naked guy?
__label__neutral That little naked guy would be me.
__label__surprise Aww, look at the little thing.
__label__non-neutral Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
__label__surprise Who are those people?
__label__surprise Got me.
__label__neutral Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
__label__surprise Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
__label__neutral Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
__label__neutral Looks like a fun gang.
__label__joy Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
__label__non-neutral Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
__label__non-neutral So, whats this about?
__label__neutral Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
__label__neutral No.  This is my red sweater.
__label__fear Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me? Okay.
__label__non-neutral Whats going on Rach?
__label__non-neutral Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
__label__non-neutral Yknow, Im actually glad Phoebe called.
__label__non-neutral I know we broke up because you thought I wasnt mature enough, but Ive really grown up and think we should get back together.
__label__non-neutral Oh, its just not the right time.
__label__non-neutral It is the right time.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Kay!
__label__neutral in the category of Favorite Returning Male Character the nominees are: John Wheeler from
__label__surprise What the?!
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Youre an Aquarius, huh?
__label__neutral I bet youre a Gemini.
__label__neutral Nope.
__label__neutral Taurus?
__label__neutral Nope.
__label__neutral Virgo?
__label__neutral Nope.
__label__neutral Sagittarius?
__label__neutral Yep.
__label__joy I knew it! I knew it, ahh.
__label__neutral Well I tell you what
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Youre not gonna speed anymore right?
__label__neutral I wont speed.
__label__neutral And you promise youll get this taken care of right away?
__label__neutral I promise.
__label__neutral And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
__label__neutral Yeah!
__label__neutral Can he handle the stick?
__label__neutral Oh well
__label__non-neutral I can handle the stick!!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Oh hi.
__label__non-neutral I cant believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
__label__non-neutral Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when youre trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
__label__surprise Weirdest thing. Did I hearMother of God its true!
__label__surprise Chandler Bing!
__label__surprise Jan-Janice!
__label__non-neutral Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
__label__neutral Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.
__label__surprise Janice I didnt even know you were pregnant! Whos the unwitting human whos essence youve stolen?
__label__neutral Its you. This is yours.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__joy Look how nervous he gets! We havent slept together in years!
__label__fear Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
__label__non-neutral Man, Im starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
__label__neutral Yknow, yknow Im lookin and I dont think anyones home here.
__label__neutral I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and yknow explain later.
__label__surprise Yeah? Really? No ones home?
__label__neutral I dont think so. Hello?  When you get in there
__label__neutral Hey, what's up?
__label__sadness I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
__label__sadness Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
__label__anger Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
__label__anger You had no relationship!!
__label__anger No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
__label__anger Oh God, stop with the plan!
__label__neutral So what, so what you saw him with a girl?
__label__anger Who cares?!
__label__anger That doesn't mean anything!
__label__neutral Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
__label__non-neutral She was kinda stupid.
__label__neutral You're right.
__label__neutral All right, I'm just gonna go on the date.
__label__neutral I'm gonna go on the date.
__label__neutral That is the new plan.
__label__non-neutral Come on, hurry!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__surprise Phoebe!
__label__joy Ta-da.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__non-neutral Ahh, look at you, you look great.
__label__neutral Do I? Thank you, so do you.
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__neutral Sparkly.
__label__joy So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh.
__label__neutral Mr. major capades guy.
__label__neutral I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
__label__joy You always said I'd make it.
__label__neutral Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.
__label__neutral I missed you.  I'm gonna get changed.
__label__neutral OK.
__label__neutral Um, now. Phoebs.
__label__neutral Oh, right, OK. Ole.
__label__neutral What?
__label__joy Um, the matador.  Ole, ha ha ha.
__label__joy Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait    for your party tonight.
__label__neutral Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call?
__label__neutral Thanks, bye.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral What's happenin'?
__label__sadness Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman    show tonight.
__label__neutral Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and    so, you know me, work comes first
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...
__label__joy "Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight"
__label__anger Stupid Jane Rogers!!
__label__surprise You are having a party tonight??
__label__neutral Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
__label__non-neutral And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were    gonna get away with that?
__label__neutral I do it every year.
__label__surprise You do that every year??
__label__anger I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
__label__non-neutral Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us??
__label__neutral Yeah...
__label__non-neutral And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times    restaurant?
__label__neutral Yeah...
__label__non-neutral OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime    tour of that button factory?
__label__surprise Who's this from?
__label__neutral Oh, that's Ross's.
__label__surprise Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered.
__label__neutral Remembered what?
__label__surprise It was like months ago.
__label__non-neutral We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__surprise I can't believe he remembered!
__label__surprise Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
__label__surprise I can't believe he did this.
__label__neutral Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
__label__surprise What did you just say?
__label__fear F-hah.... flennin....
__label__surprise Oh.... my God.
__label__joy I really like waking up with you.
__label__joy I like waking up with you too.  Oh! It's such a beautiful morning.  Oh, I can stay here all day.
__label__joy That would be great!
__label__joy We could have breakfast in bed
__label__non-neutral Wait, just a second.
__label__surprise Okay.  Oh! Oh no.
__label__sadness Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from
__label__surprise Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__surprise This is Bonnie?  This is Bonnie?  Youre Bonnie?
__label__neutral I can show you an ID if you want?
__label__surprise Oh no, Im sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
__label__neutral Oh, that must be it.
__label__neutral Well I hope you have fun tonight.
__label__joy Thanks! You too.
__label__neutral I believe it.
__label__non-neutral No you dont.
__label__neutral Yes, I do.
__label__anger No you doy'know what, youre not gonna suck me into this.
__label__anger Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
__label__anger I do not always have to beokay, okay.
__label__neutral Jurassic Park
__label__fear I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
__label__neutral Maybe we should check the trash chute.
__label__neutral Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
__label__neutral That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral There he is!
__label__anger Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!
__label__neutral Just, y'know out.
__label__non-neutral Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
__label__neutral What were you doing?
__label__neutral I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
__label__non-neutral You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
__label__non-neutral He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
__label__anger Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
__label__joy He hooked up!! Tell us about her!

__label__non-neutral Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
__label__neutral Hi Joey.
__label__neutral Hey! How you doin?
__label__joy He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
__label__neutral Id love to show ya, but I just tucked her in.
__label__neutral Shes sleeping.
__label__neutral Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
__label__sadness Well, the old lady died.
__label__neutral And how do I know?
__label__neutral Her dying wish was for one last kiss.
__label__non-neutral But I dont care,  because you got the apartment.
__label__joy Yes!
__label__disgust Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think Im gonna stay here.
__label__joy Isnt that great?
__label__non-neutral Ezels!!
__label__non-neutral Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, its not your fault.
__label__non-neutral Wow, thats great.
__label__joy Oh, yeah!
__label__neutral Y'know you could totally sell this. Itd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
__label__non-neutral I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
__label__surprise What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
__label__neutral Okay, well if I was in this for the money, Id be a millionaire by now, y'know.
__label__neutral You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
__label__neutral Aw, youre right, youre right. Im sorry.
__label__non-neutral Thats okay. All right, Im gonna play song thats really, really sad. Its called Magician Box Mix Up.
__label__neutral Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right.
__label__neutral Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right?
__label__joy Okay, great.
__label__disgust You freak.
__label__joy Thank you.
__label__neutral Um, coffee to go, please.
__label__neutral Isabella Rosselini.
__label__surprise Are you serious?  Oh my God.
__label__non-neutral Damn! I cant believe I took her off my list.
__label__neutral Why? Cause otherwise youd go for it?
__label__neutral Yeah, maybe.
__label__disgust Oh-oh, you lie.
__label__neutral What you dont think Id go up to her?
__label__neutral Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
__label__anger Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
__label__neutral You know what honey, you go ahead, well call her an alternate.
__label__neutral Okay, hold my crawler.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__surprise Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
__label__non-neutral Honey, hes about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. Im just sorry we dont got popcorn.
__label__neutral Okay, that's, that's enough.
__label__neutral '....
__label__non-neutral Won't you dance around with me.
__label__surprise A-ha!!!
__label__joy Oh-oh-oh, yeah!  That's right, you take good care of those babies!
__label__surprise Excuse me?
__label__joy It's me, Joey!
__label__surprise Do I know you?
__label__non-neutral Joey!
__label__neutral Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
__label__neutral Okay thats fair.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Good!
__label__neutral Pick one.
__label__joy Left!  Thank you.
__label__neutral Youre welcome.
__label__surprise Ross!
__label__non-neutral Joey!  We should just switch.
__label__joy Yeah absolutely!
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__sadness Rachel, were sorry for pushing those guys on you.
__label__joy Oh thats all right!
__label__joy Yknow, I ended up having a really good time.
__label__joy Yknow, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
__label__neutral So what was it for anyway?
__label__neutral I wanna say a disease.
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__neutral I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on
__label__neutral Huh. All right.
__label__surprise Oh my God, look! Thats Elizabeth!
__label__neutral Oh-oh Professor Geller.
__label__neutral Ahh, to be 13 again.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
__label__anger No! He blew us off!
__label__surprise What?!
__label__surprise I know!
__label__anger I cant believe it.  Can I tell you something? Im a little mad at him now.
__label__anger Can I tell you something? Me too.
__label__anger Yknow what? He didnt want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we dont talk to him
__label__joy Ooooh! Freeze him out.
__label__joy Thats right!
__label__joy I like it!
__label__neutral Doorknob?
__label__neutral Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
__label__joy Oh good.
__label__fear Look, I  Look, Im having a great time with you and I just dont want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us.
__label__sadness So, Im sorry I just dont think we should go away together yet.
__label__fear Its-its too soon.
__label__surprise Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that Im going to Florida for a couple weeks.
__label__surprise No. I think you misunderstood what
__label__joy You are so adorable.
__label__joy That! Lets talk about that.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral How do you feel?
__label__neutral Well, lets just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
__label__neutral Okay, so I
__label__neutral And protected them from a tornado?
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral I know, the babies are asleep.
__label__surprise Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
__label__joy I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
__label__surprise But my apartment!
__label__neutral Was the setting of Phoebes triumph.
__label__non-neutral But the mess!
__label__neutral Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
__label__neutral Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out.
__label__neutral Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!
__label__neutral When will that be?
__label__neutral !
__label__non-neutral Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey Ross! The babys kicking!
__label__surprise What?! It is?!
__label__non-neutral Its not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again.
__label__non-neutral Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
__label__joy Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joeys room and he was sleeping
__label__neutral A dreamless sleep.
__label__non-neutral So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
__label__neutral Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
__label__neutral Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral When are you coming home?
__label__surprise What? Guys, I'm not.
__label__neutral C'mon, this is us.
__label__neutral I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
__label__surprise Waitressing?
__label__neutral Okay, I'm not just waitressing.
__label__neutral I'm..
__label__neutral I, um...
__label__neutral I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh...
__label__non-neutral I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
__label__neutral We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
__label__neutral So, um, will you bring the truck?
__label__neutral I'll even let you ring the bell.
__label__surprise Oh, my god.
__label__non-neutral See, there you go, the cleansing works!
__label__neutral They're nice guys.
__label__joy Oh, they're firemen guys.
__label__neutral Your son.
__label__anger No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
__label__neutral Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
__label__surprise What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,
__label__non-neutral Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
__label__neutral I got it.
__label__neutral I got it.
__label__non-neutral I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
__label__neutral No, you don't.
__label__anger All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
__label__surprise Why?
__label__anger He started it!
__label__non-neutral No, you started it.
__label__anger You did!
__label__anger I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
__label__neutral But...
__label__anger Now go!
__label__non-neutral Thanks a lot.
__label__non-neutral See what you did.
__label__neutral Yeah, listen...
__label__anger Out
__label__non-neutral Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say?
__label__neutral Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
__label__surprise Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
__label__neutral Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi.
__label__neutral Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
__label__neutral You didnt say Boutros Boutros Gali.
__label__neutral Boutros Boutros Gali.
__label__neutral He says he was too.
__label__neutral Interesting.
__label__neutral So I was wondering....
__label__non-neutral Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
__label__joy Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.
__label__neutral So you're a chef?
__label__joy Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
__label__surprise Oh, really.
__label__non-neutral Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing?
__label__neutral Well, I was having a conversation.
__label__anger Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I havent been able to say two words to each other.
__label__anger What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
__label__neutral That would be great. Thank you.
__label__disgust so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera!
__label__neutral Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
__label__surprise When did that happen to you?!
__label__non-neutral Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera!
__label__disgust Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
__label__joy Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it.
__label__non-neutral Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
__label__neutral Here, I'll get it.
__label__neutral We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
__label__joy Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
__label__non-neutral Oh, great!
__label__non-neutral Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!
__label__surprise That was unbelievable!
__label__non-neutral Okay, see? I told you!
__label__sadness Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
__label__non-neutral I don't believe they're brother and sister.
__label__surprise They're brother and sister!!!
__label__neutral Action!
__label__non-neutral I found the picture!
__label__surprise What picture?!
__label__non-neutral The picture of my wife! In your pack!
__label__non-neutral You went through my personal property?
__label__anger Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
__label__non-neutral Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years!
__label__joy Cut! Wonderful!
__label__joy Great scene yeah?
__label__joy Oh youre awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
__label__joy Thanks a lot.
__label__neutral Heres your call sheet for tomorrow.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__joy So Chandler, your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
__label__joy I remember when we first got engaged.
__label__neutral Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story.
__label__non-neutral Oh dad, really you dont need to
__label__non-neutral Well, Id gotten Judy pregnant. I still dont know how that happened.
__label__disgust You dont know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
__label__neutral What a sweet story.
__label__disgust Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
__label__surprise What?! They wanted a scary story!
__label__joy Anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.
__label__surprise What?
__label__fear You tell her Jack, I cant do it.
__label__surprise What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund dont you?
__label__non-neutral We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
__label__neutral After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
__label__joy Did that!
__label__neutral Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
__label__surprise Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
__label__surprise Was it not pain-free?
__label__disgust No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
__label__neutral Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad.
__label__non-neutral Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.
__label__neutral But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest.
__label__surprise Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
__label__non-neutral Now, are you glad we didnt start with the bikini strips?
__label__neutral now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
__label__neutral I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
__label__neutral Do you wanna start telling secrets?
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__neutral Now umm, remember Im still learning.
__label__neutral One, two, three, four!
__label__joy You know the song! Sing along!
__label__neutral So?
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__surprise Oh my God! Thats David!
__label__neutral David who?
__label__sadness David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral Oh, you say someones name enough, they turn around.
__label__surprise Phoebe?
__label__surprise David!  What-what are you doing here? Arent you supposed to be in Russia?
__label__neutral Yeah, Im just, Im just in town for a conference. Umm,
__label__joy Well Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
__label__neutral Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy Yes! Santa's coming!
__label__sadness Hey, uh, Im really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
__label__neutral Its no big deal. Hey, yknow, you do what you gotta do. Right?
__label__neutral But hey, its not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides
__label__non-neutral Whatever.
__label__non-neutral Its like that everywhere, Joey!
__label__neutral Okay, Mon, back me up here.
__label__neutral Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right?
__label__neutral And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
__label__sadness I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
__label__neutral Look, Ross, really its-its no big deal.
__label__sadness Yknow you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so be it.
__label__neutral Yknow, hey I understand.
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__neutral Hey, when Im in a play and youre in the audience, I dont talk to you, right?
__label__neutral So its yknow, its uh, its cool.
__label__neutral Ill see you tomorrow.
__label__neutral Yeah, when were in the audience he doesnt talk to us, but he does wave.
__label__non-neutral You did look like an idiot.
__label__non-neutral Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot.
__label__neutral All right?
__label__non-neutral Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?"
__label__joy And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
__label__neutral Yeah that's the same.
__label__non-neutral That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
__label__neutral Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
__label__neutral Which one?
__label__sadness Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
__label__non-neutral Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about.
__label__sadness Y'know, for me anyway.
__label__sadness And of course, the Indians.
__label__anger Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
__label__neutral Hi, guys.
__label__joy Hi! Phoebe.
__label__neutral Hi Phoebe.
__label__sadness I-I wanted to apologise if Iyknow seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Yknow its just the hormones, yknow.
__label__neutral No we

__label__non-neutral Your parents?
__label__neutral Yeah, theyre out of town.
__label__surprise Ohh.

__label__joy Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
__label__neutral Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
__label__neutral Yes, hi.
__label__joy Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.
__label__sadness I didnt know you and Carol were getting divorced, Im sorry.
__label__joy Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!
__label__neutral No leg-chewing for us sir.
__label__neutral Oh well, give it time.
__label__joy So the divorce, the marriage, weve got a lot to celebrate.
__label__neutral How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?
__label__non-neutral I cant think of anything were doing.  Why cant I think of anything were doing?
__label__joy Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six.
__label__joy They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
__label__joy Okay, Ill see you tomorrow!
__label__neutral Just so you know, were not seeing him tomorrow.
__label__disgust I-I cannot spend another evening with that man.
__label__disgust Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
__label__neutral No.
__label__disgust Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
__label__disgust Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts
__label__neutral Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs

__label__neutral Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
__label__neutral Yeah, so?
__label__neutral Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
__label__neutral Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
__label__surprise Why?
__label__neutral Why?
__label__neutral What's your point?
__label__neutral So uh, whats your name?

__label__neutral Yeah, big fan.
__label__joy Me too! Theres a game on Tuesday, do you wanna go?
__label__joy Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure Im not doing anything Tuesday.
__label__disgust Ugh.  Ross!
__label__neutral Hi! Sorry Im late. Were you sleeping?
__label__non-neutral Ahh, nooo!!
__label__joy Oh, great!
__label__neutral Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery.
__label__neutral I got you the best one I could, cause thats not where you want to skimp.
__label__joy Youre a genius, Ross.
__label__neutral Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
__label__neutral Okay, Ill pay you tomorrow.

__label__disgust Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
__label__non-neutral Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
__label__neutral I think I need a drink.
__label__non-neutral Yeah!
__label__neutral Hey, Pheebs?
__label__anger No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
__label__sadness Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again.
__label__neutral And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.
__label__non-neutral You really think I'm ready?
__label__joy Uh-huh!
__label__joy Wow! Cool!
__label__neutral Was the chord at least right
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__neutral Well, this has been fun.
__label__joy Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
__label__neutral Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya.
__label__neutral Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457.
__label__neutral And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
__label__neutral Were beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
__label__joy Im really glad we came.  Youre so pretty. I love you.
__label__neutral Okay, thats a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
__label__neutral Excuse me, Im sorry, Im gonna have to call you back, Ive got a Schemp in my office.
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral Im sorry.
__label__neutral But ah, hey, oh, somebodys off the phone, how bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
__label__neutral Ross youre not listening to me, I dont have time to stop.
__label__neutral Come on Rach, you dont have what, ten minutes?
__label__anger I dont have ten minutes!!
__label__neutral What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
__label__anger Hey, Ross!!! I told you I dont!

__label__neutral Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, Ive got a deadline, would you just go home, Ill talk to you later.
__label__neutral Yeah, but wait...
__label__neutral Good bye!
__label__neutral Actually, thats our three hole punch.
__label__surprise Oh yeah? When?
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral I'll tell you what.
__label__neutral When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
__label__surprise Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
__label__neutral Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
__label__non-neutral Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
__label__neutral No, no, no.
__label__non-neutral What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
__label__neutral Uh, uh.
__label__surprise Well?
__label__surprise Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__surprise Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
__label__surprise Did you go home and change?
__label__neutral Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
__label__neutral No, I haven't seen him.
__label__surprise Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him?
__label__neutral Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
__label__neutral Yeah, why?
__label__neutral No reason.
__label__joy I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!
__label__surprise What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
__label__non-neutral All right, Ill do it just this once! But you cant tell anybody!
__label__joy Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
__label__neutral Yeah, thats her.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__surprise Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that sign didnt work!
__label__neutral Yknow what would work?
__label__neutral Hmm?
__label__anger Stop making candy!
__label__non-neutral But they like it!
__label__neutral You mean they like you.
__label__neutral Maybe.
__label__surprise Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
__label__anger Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
__label__anger We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled CUT!
__label__surprise Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
__label__joy Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
__label__non-neutral Cos I was gonna say theres no way you couldve done the end the way you guys did it back then!
__label__surprise What? We could do it!
__label__non-neutral I dont know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
__label__non-neutral I can do it, okay? Come on, lets go.
__label__neutral 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
__label__non-neutral I cant do it!
__label__neutral Now you do that, youre on TV.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral So, what are you guys in the market for? Weve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
__label__neutral Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. Thats the stuff. What do you think?
__label__neutral Well, I dont have to buy that, "Im with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
__label__neutral Well, I like it. Here you go.
__label__non-neutral All right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you? Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day?
__label__surprise Oh, I embarrass you?
__label__neutral How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you?
__label__non-neutral Hes just jealous. Youll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
__label__neutral Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
__label__neutral Theyre all tourists.
__label__disgust All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah?  If youre gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
__label__non-neutral Good choice.
__label__non-neutral Thanks.
__label__anger Okay, wait. All right, thats it, okay, Im out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
__label__surprise So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
__label__surprise What?
__label__anger Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.
__label__neutral And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my
__label__surprise Whoa, whoa, whoa.
__label__anger You don't even know me...
__label__surprise Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
__label__surprise What?
__label__sadness The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
__label__sadness I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
__label__neutral No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
__label__neutral Oh yeah.
__label__neutral Okay, forward. ForwardStop!  Okay, backStop!  Okay, forwardStop! Stop! Stop!
__label__neutral Ross, just forget about it. This guys got you totally wedged in.
__label__neutral Is this yours?
__label__neutral Well actually
__label__non-neutral No-no-no! Its mine! Its-its mine.
__label__neutral Dude, you soooo need this car.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay, heres what were gonna do.
__label__non-neutral Okay, Im gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral.
__label__neutral You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral All right, here we go.
__label__non-neutral Haul ass!!!
__label__neutral !
__label__neutral So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain.
__label__neutral So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
__label__joy ...and live forever as a machine!
__label__joy That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?
__label__neutral You and I, we're interfacing.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I gotta go.
__label__joy Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
__label__neutral David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
__label__neutral Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
__label__neutral See?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
__label__neutral Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
__label__neutral Oh, I should go, too.
__label__neutral Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
__label__non-neutral Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there.
__label__non-neutral And she was like "Oh, don't worry!
__label__neutral I asked him.
__label__non-neutral He's totally ok with seeing you!".
__label__joy So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
__label__non-neutral Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
__label__non-neutral Exactly!
__label__neutral And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
__label__non-neutral I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,
__label__neutral Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
__label__joy Ok, that'll be great!
__label__disgust Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
__label__disgust That's not what we're gonna do!
__label__disgust Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
__label__joy Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
__label__neutral Hello Skidmark.
__label__neutral Its a nickname, Ill explain later.
__label__neutral Its pretty clear.
__label__neutral Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
__label__surprise Thats why you broke up with me?
__label__non-neutral You-you-you didnt know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!
__label__joy Ni-chou chi-ma!
__label__non-neutral Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
__label__neutral Hi everyone.
__label__neutral I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
__label__non-neutral Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
__label__neutral Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
__label__fear What did, what did he say?
__label__neutral Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.
__label__neutral So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so.
__label__neutral .
__label__neutral .
__label__joy Oh, great!
__label__joy We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
__label__non-neutral Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly.
__label__joy All I could think of was yknow, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
__label__neutral And did he?
__label__joy Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
__label__neutral Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
__label__joy I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks today and Ive only had six.
__label__non-neutral Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.
__label__sadness Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I?
__label__disgust You sound like a guy.
__label__disgust No, a guy would be saying, "Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!
__label__surprise Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up!
__label__sadness I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again.
__label__neutral Youll have a last kiss.
__label__joy Thank you so much for coming back over.
__label__non-neutral Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
__label__neutral I know Mona, just hear me out.
__label__neutral First of all, Im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own.
__label__neutral Youre gonna have to tell me how you did that.
__label__neutral Focus.
__label__neutral Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are
__label__neutral All right wheres that turkey!
__label__surprise Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
__label__joy Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
__label__neutral No.
__label__anger No!
__label__non-neutral Yes!
__label__neutral Ahh.
__label__joy Oh, would you look at that Monica?
__label__joy I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
__label__anger Okay, Im next.  Dont! Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe!
__label__joy Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.
__label__anger Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!
__label__neutral Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
__label__neutral Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
__label__neutral Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.
__label__non-neutral But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
__label__non-neutral I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!
__label__non-neutral Or Friday with no two pizzas!
__label__non-neutral All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over.
__label__joy No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!
__label__non-neutral All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
__label__joy Thats right!
__label__joy Cause Im a Tribbiani!
__label__neutral And this is what we do!
__label__non-neutral I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we dont read a lot or run very fast, but damnit!
__label__joy We can eat!
__label__neutral Well?
__label__surprise Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
__label__joy Look at this!
__label__surprise Oh! You have a window!
__label__joy Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...
__label__surprise Oh look! That guy's peeing!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__non-neutral Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
__label__neutral Ohh.
__label__neutral Okay. Lets use this brush.
__label__neutral Okay. This stuff?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
__label__neutral Oke-dokey.
__label__neutral Where exactly is your zoo?
__label__neutral Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.
__label__neutral Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__neutral Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
__label__non-neutral No-no, he's, he's very docile.
__label__neutral Even if he were... cornered?
__label__neutral Well I, I don't know. Why?
__label__neutral Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
__label__non-neutral He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
__label__neutral How about a hammer, or a small blade?
__label__non-neutral Why- why- why would he need a blade?
__label__non-neutral Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something.
__label__neutral Otherwise it's just cruel.
__label__joy He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
__label__neutral We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
__label__neutral ...He's in.
__label__joy He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
__label__disgust You're making a big mistake here.
__label__neutral I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
__label__non-neutral My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.
__label__joy Really helped speed the process along!
__label__surprise Janice!
__label__surprise You're not... gone?
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__neutral Sid is still in his room.
__label__non-neutral I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him.
__label__surprise So did you do it?
__label__neutral Did you make your deposit?
__label__joy Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
__label__fear That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
__label__non-neutral I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
__label__neutral Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
__label__non-neutral Phoebe, where's your purse?
__label__non-neutral No, no! Give it to me!
__label__anger You can't have it.
__label__anger Give it to me!
__label__anger No
__label__anger I'll go in there.
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah.
__label__neutral Phoebe come here
__label__joy Haha!
__label__anger Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
__label__disgust What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
__label__neutral I just had sex.
__label__surprise Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
__label__neutral Well, you never told me how old you were.
__label__disgust Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
__label__joy I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
__label__fear Don't say it.
__label__joy ...in love with you.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__sadness Sorry.
__label__anger Well,fall out of it.
__label__anger You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night.
__label__non-neutral Oh god, oh god.
__label__disgust I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.
__label__disgust I'm Joan Collins.
__label__neutral Who?
__label__non-neutral Thats right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!
__label__neutral Uh sweetie, maybe youd be more comfortable here?
__label__anger You. Like you havent done enough.
__label__neutral Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.
__label__neutral I mean I wish I were a seahorse.
__label__neutral Because with seahorses its the male, they carry the babies.
__label__non-neutral And then also umm, Id be far away in the sea.
__label__non-neutral God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
__label__neutral Oh I know, Ive been there. I remember toward the end
__label__neutral Oh Phoebe, thats a great story.
__label__non-neutral Can you tell it to me when youre getting me some iced tea?
__label__anger Oh God, get out!
__label__anger Get out!!
__label__anger Get out!!
__label__anger Get out!
__label__anger !
__label__neutral Lets.
__label__joy All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itll be okay.
__label__fear Oh my God.Whats he gonna do now?
__label__fear I cant watch!
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__non-neutral Seriously, how can you watch this?
__label__non-neutral Arent you scared?
__label__fear Terrified.
__label__joy Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
__label__neutral Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
__label__surprise Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse?
__label__neutral Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine.
__label__neutral I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
__label__neutral Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I
__label__joy Fine! Maybe I will too!
__label__non-neutral Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
__label__non-neutral You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
__label__non-neutral MY SANDWICH?!!!
__label__anger MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
__label__neutral Whats the matter, Pheebs?
__label__non-neutral She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
__label__surprise What?!
__label__sadness Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.
__label__sadness Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is.
__label__sadness She knows, and she wont tell me.
__label__sadness Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
__label__sadness Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet.
__label__neutral Where ya going?
__label__neutral Well, shes out of town so, theres gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
__label__fear Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
__label__anger Well, are any of those people here?!
__label__surprise Oh my God, so do I!
__label__surprise I knew it, wow!!
__label__neutral Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
__label__joy Ohh, so cute.
__label__anger Uh-huh, well! But umm, still Im-Im mad at you.
__label__non-neutral I know. Im mad at me too.
__label__neutral Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? Im kinda hungry.
__label__surprise Hey! Me too!
__label__non-neutral All right, stop it. Now youre just doing it to freak me out.
__label__neutral Ok, you can do this.
__label__neutral It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.
__label__neutral Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
__label__sadness Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
__label__anger All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.
__label__surprise Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
__label__surprise Really?  My God, hes really cute.
__label__neutral Go for it.
__label__surprise Phoebe, Im engaged!
__label__neutral Im just saying, get his number just in case.
__label__neutral But no: Chandler is in an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
__label__non-neutral Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, Im engaged.
__label__disgust Well you should be embarrassed.
__label__joy I did, but that was really fun.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Chandler. I sensed it was you.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Unagi. Im always aware.
__label__non-neutral Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?
__label__neutral Whats up?
__label__neutral I cant figure out what to make Monica.
__label__non-neutral Oh, why dont you make her one of your little jokes.
__label__fear Im going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__neutral Shed-shed love this.
__label__non-neutral Uh, its an exact replica of Apollo 8.
__label__neutral I made it in the sixth grade.
__label__neutral Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
__label__neutral Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon.
__label__non-neutral But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
__label__non-neutral Wait a minute, I cant give this to her.
__label__neutral Why not?
__label__non-neutral Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
__label__neutral Yeah, see ya.
__label__joy Hey, thank you so much.
__label__non-neutral Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
__label__neutral No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
__label__anger Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
__label__neutral He might still show up.
__label__anger Oh, what are you, stupid? Its been three hours.
__label__neutral Is that all?
__label__sadness I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding?
__label__neutral Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding.
__label__neutral Um, its going to be a small ceremony.
__label__surprise Uh, tiny!
__label__neutral Were not even sure why were having it.
__label__neutral Its actually going to be just family.
__label__surprise Ohwaityou two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing
__label__neutral Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
__label__joy Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
__label__joy Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
__label__neutral Well, I brought the next best thing.
__label__surprise Whoa!  Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
__label__joy Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
__label__joy Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
__label__joy You're so sweet!
__label__joy Ohh, you're so sweet!
__label__surprise Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
__label__neutral Huh.
__label__non-neutral Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
__label__neutral Uhh.
__label__anger You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
__label__neutral Nah.
__label__fear How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape, a rapist or a killer or something!
__label__surprise Dont you think I asked him that before he got in?!
__label__anger Yknow what? Im not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!
__label__anger No!
__label__neutral Do you like car games?
__label__neutral Yeah, yknow the license plate game?
__label__neutral I
__label__joy Ooh, Ill play! Ill play!
__label__non-neutral No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
__label__neutral Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica?
__label__non-neutral I cant figure this out!
__label__non-neutral Its so hard!
__label__non-neutral Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah!
__label__non-neutral Paper cut!
__label__neutral Now, have you told anyone else?
__label__neutral No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont want Monica to find out.
__label__surprise You told me.
__label__non-neutral Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
__label__surprise Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadnt been on the toilet.
__label__neutral Me too.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
__label__neutral Oh all right.
__label__neutral Yeah, coffeehouse.
__label__neutral Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
__label__neutral Oh well, we dont because we gottheother pl-place.
__label__disgust How rude.
__label__surprise Oh, Im sorry. You wanna bite?
__label__surprise The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise The ring is gone!
__label__disgust Ugh.
__label__non-neutral Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisAh-ha-ha!!
__label__non-neutral You lost the ring!
__label__anger Youre the worst best man ever!
__label__anger Dude, this isnt funny!
__label__fear What am I gonna do?!
__label__non-neutral I go to bed last night, everythings cool!
__label__non-neutral I wake up this morning, the strippers gone and the ring is gone!
__label__surprise You slept with the stripper?
__label__non-neutral Of course!!
__label__anger What difference does that make?!
__label__non-neutral Well, I'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
__label__neutral Joey, do you have a minute?
__label__fear Dude, what am I gonna
__label__non-neutral Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
__label__fear Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
__label__neutral Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
__label__non-neutral Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have
__label__neutral What-what is it, what is it?
__label__surprise Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
__label__non-neutral Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
__label__non-neutral Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
__label__disgust I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
__label__surprise What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
__label__disgust And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
__label__non-neutral I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone
__label__anger I'm not listening to you!
__label__joy Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it!
__label__non-neutral Stick to your side!
__label__non-neutral Hey, come on now!
__label__neutral All right, what are we havin?
__label__neutral Uhh, I dont believe in these crazy diets yknow, just everything in moderation.
__label__neutral Ill take those to go.  For the kids.
__label__neutral Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
__label__non-neutral It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldnt have said.
__label__neutral But believe me, thats not gonna happen today.
__label__neutral Understood. So, whatd you say back then?
__label__neutral Well, I said that I
__label__neutral Ha!
__label__joy So you like the drums!
__label__joy That's, that's great!
__label__neutral Yknow, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation.
__label__non-neutral All right, okay, well, apparently not!
__label__joy So, yay!
__label__neutral Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four...
__label__joy Tequila!!
__label__joy That's fun.
__label__surprise Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
__label__sadness Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
__label__anger Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
__label__fear Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we just forget about it.
__label__anger Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed.
__label__neutral All right thats it, school is in session!
__label__surprise My God! Is this a gym card?
__label__neutral Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but Ive missed the last 1200 times.
__label__neutral So why dont you quit?
__label__non-neutral You dont think Ive tried? You think I
__label__neutral Who is Maria?
__label__joy Oh Maria. You cant say no to her, shes like this lycra spandex covered gymtreat.
__label__neutral You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
__label__anger No!
__label__neutral So youre strong enough to face her on your own?
__label__fear Oh no, youll have to come.
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__neutral Thank you.  Mon?
__label__neutral Hmm?
__label__neutral Pheebs, I dont think anyone's mad about that.
__label__non-neutral Exactly! Because it's in the past!
__label__neutral Anybody gonna eat that?
__label__joy Pheebs!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Listen, you know how uh, when youre wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
__label__non-neutral Yeah!
__label__surprise Well, when Jake did it I saw thathe was wearing womens underwear!
__label__neutral I know. They were mine.
__label__disgust Oh.  No! No wait, thats weird!
__label__neutral No, its not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
__label__disgust Thats weird!
__label__neutral Im wearing his briefs right now.
__label__non-neutral Thatskinda hot.
__label__joy I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
__label__neutral Yeah, I wouldnt know about that.
__label__joy And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
__label__disgust Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
__label__non-neutral There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinking even more than you.
__label__disgust Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.
__label__non-neutral Im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear!
__label__non-neutral I dont think you could ever do that.
__label__non-neutral Hey! I
__label__disgust Okay, whatever.
__label__neutral Lusts of the flesh.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral I dont know.  A cowboy theme?
__label__neutral Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
__label__joy Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it's beautiful I love it!
__label__neutral Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
__label__neutral Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my  breast?
__label__neutral It's all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but don't worry. It'll happen.
__label__surprise Yowsa!
__label__neutral Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your  mouth.
__label__non-neutral Dear Lord.
__label__neutral I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?
__label__neutral Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…
__label__non-neutral Oh look, she's pulling away again!
__label__neutral Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?
__label__neutral She looks scared.
__label__neutral Doesn't she  look scared?
__label__neutral Y'know, I don't really know her.
__label__neutral Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
__label__neutral No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
__label__neutral Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
__label__neutral Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."
__label__neutral Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
__label__non-neutral Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
__label__anger No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.
__label__non-neutral The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
__label__non-neutral Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
__label__neutral Pathetic mess?
__label__neutral I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.
__label__joy I'm thinkin', cha-ching!
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__neutral Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice.
__label__neutral You're doin' this.
__label__neutral Hi. She said yes.
__label__joy Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?
__label__joy "Happy birthday to you!"
__label__neutral Youre paying for that.
__label__surprise What? No-no its her birthday!
__label__surprise Youve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
__label__neutral But it really
__label__neutral You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
__label__anger Damnit!
__label__joy Rach? Hi!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
__label__neutral Well yeah
__label__surprise Oh wow!
__label__surprise I mean, wow!
__label__non-neutral I mean, I-I-I think shes cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
__label__neutral Oh so-so not really never.
__label__neutral I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.
__label__neutral I mean after all weve been through, I justyknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.
__label__neutral Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
__label__non-neutral Oh-ho, and mine!
__label__non-neutral Okay, sono toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
__label__fear No-no wait-wait! I cant just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
__label__neutral WellI only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.
__label__non-neutral Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
__label__sadness Its just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
__label__neutral Chandler?
__label__non-neutral I-Im sorry?
__label__non-neutral No look, I-Im sure that people know you exist!
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah?
__label__neutral I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.
__label__sadness Ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk.
__label__neutral Hang-hang on.
__label__neutral Hey everybody!
__label__sadness Uh, Im gonna kill myself!
__label__neutral Ill get back to ya.
__label__neutral I got nothing.
__label__neutral Wait.
__label__neutral Uh, hey Marge!
__label__neutral Ehh, nothing.
__label__non-neutral Nothing.
__label__surprise Apparently, theres like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and theres only this one robot and this one guy who controls it!
__label__surprise I didnt know he could get me fired!
__label__fear What am I going to do?
__label__neutral Well yknow Joey, youre a pretty charming guy.
__label__fear Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
__label__neutral No sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! Youve got to kiss some serious robot ass!
__label__neutral Thats not a bad idea.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.
__label__joy Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
__label__neutral So do you think uh, Joeys more charming than me?
__label__non-neutral Yeah! Thats why Im sleeping with him on the side.
__label__neutral Yeah, you wish.
__label__non-neutral "You wish."
__label__non-neutral Why are you yelling?
__label__non-neutral Whoa, that
__label__surprise Whoa-whoa, what is it?
__label__neutral Well Its a date.
__label__surprise A date?!
__label__surprise No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldnt schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
__label__sadness Come on Joey, dont make me feel badly about this.
__label__anger No, Im gonna!!
__label__anger Thats right!
__label__anger Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin out with that girl!
__label__anger Like-like-like I did something terrible to you!
__label__anger And now Pheebs, youre doing the same thing!
__label__anger ThatIts not the same thing! This is
__label__anger Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
__label__surprise She was?
__label__anger Well, she graduated from high school!
__label__non-neutral Okay, whatever.

__label__neutral Listen, Roberts gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
__label__non-neutral Oh.
__label__fear Please, right now, no, every time I see him its like Is it on the lose? Is it watching me?
__label__non-neutral We cant tell him, you cant go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
__label__neutral Hes right, even if its to say something complementary.
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral So are ready for the gym? Theyve got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.

__label__neutral Can I help you?
__label__fear Uh-oh.
__label__neutral Uh, y'know what, were having second thoughts about our copying needs. And well need a little more time to think about it.
__label__neutral Chloe, switch with me, theres some guys here that got a crush on you.
__label__non-neutral Okay, that hurt us.
__label__neutral Hi guys. I havent seen you since this morning.

__label__joy Oh yeah, Id love that.
__label__joy Oh, great! Me too.
__label__neutral I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
__label__neutral And why do you care so much?
__label__joy Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
__label__non-neutral You had fantasies about Emily?
__label__neutral No! Yknow,
__label__neutral Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
__label__non-neutral Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
__label__neutral Ahh.

__label__surprise You love her!
__label__neutral What-what is love really?

__label__anger When we make plans, I expect you to show up.
__label__anger Okay, I cant just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better!

__label__sadness When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!
__label__non-neutral Look, things like last night they dont just happen.
__label__non-neutral Yknow?
__label__non-neutral Or at least not to me.
__label__non-neutral Or with the other two women, in the morning yknow I was just lying there and I couldnt wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yknow with a friend.
__label__surprise Chandler!
__label__sadness I know you probably dont want to go out with me, yknow because I make too many jokes and Ive never been in a serious relationship and I guess Im not technically a "doctor"
__label__neutral There was just one woman, wasnt there?
__label__neutral No, there were two.
__label__surprise Including me?
__label__joy Oh yeah.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Welcome back!
__label__joy Hey!  Can we pick up where we left off?
__label__neutral I dont know, Im still pretty tired out from this afternoon.
__label__surprise Why?
__label__neutral Uh, the sex.
__label__surprise What sex?
__label__non-neutral Our sex.
__label__surprise We didnt have sex.
__label__non-neutral Well if I didnt have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like
__label__disgust Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
__label__disgust Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
__label__disgust Oh my God Stu! I-I cant believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure shes a hooker?
__label__surprise Either that or shes just the best, most expensive date I ever had.
__label__sadness Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
__label__neutral Im your mother.
__label__surprise Ehh?
__label__neutral Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldnt go out with a guy like Chandler...
__label__neutral Hi there.
__label__neutral ...and he couldnt let it go, and... I dont really know what happened with that either.
__label__surprise Oh-oh!
__label__neutral And then Rosss new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head.
__label__neutral And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I dont know what happened there either...
__label__neutral Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler.
__label__neutral Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
__label__sadness Well yeah, I lied before.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__surprise Oh God
__label__neutral Now you know how you really feel about it.
__label__surprise Oh-oh, thats a risky little game!
__label__fear Are you really gonna do this?
__label__joy Yeah. Im gonna have a baby. Im gonna have a baby. Im gonna have a baby!
__label__neutral With who?
__label__neutral Ah, its still not the time.

__label__neutral When did I say you were boring?!
__label__surprise Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
__label__neutral Phoebe! You and I have
__label__non-neutral Oh, come on!
__label__neutral Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake?
__label__non-neutral We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!
__label__neutral Okay, there's a
__label__anger All right, Im leaving!
__label__anger Because Im not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move.

__label__neutral You take care Jill.
__label__non-neutral Okay, see ya!
__label__non-neutral Bye-bye-e!

__label__non-neutral How about, youre moving!!
__label__anger Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
__label__neutral Hey, how are you guys doing?
__label__joy Great! Monicas moving!
__label__non-neutral I am not!
__label__surprise Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
__label__neutral Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know whats going on here. Okay, you guys

__label__joy Oh great!  Wow! Yeah, its comfortable.
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__non-neutral Oh! Here we

__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral I'm sorry.
__label__neutral It's just 'cause I couldn't be there.
__label__sadness 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
__label__neutral Sorry.
__label__neutral What happened?
__label__neutral Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
__label__joy See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
__label__neutral Well
__label__non-neutral Get out!
__label__surprise I just didnt see the fast song coming.
__label__neutral Shh.
__label__neutral Shh.
__label__neutral Dont try to talk, well get you up to your room, well soak your feet, youll be okay.
__label__neutral Oh, thank you.
__label__joy That is so sweet!
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.
__label__neutral Tell me about it, I feel like Im holding down the fort all by myself.
__label__neutral Its Joey right?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__surprise Wait a minute!
__label__anger No!
__label__surprise Im the nice one!
__label__surprise Im the one who danced with the kids all night!
__label__neutral HowHow small are your feet?
__label__surprise !
__label__neutral Uhh, do you mind sitting there. Im-Im saving this for my friend Ross.
__label__neutral You mean Dr. Geller?
__label__surprise Doctor? Wow! I didnt know he had a nickname.
__label__neutral Oh, he wont sit here.
__label__neutral Only the people in the white coats sit over there,  and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, it mustve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__sadness Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
__label__neutral Oh yeah man.  Joey.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Oh no its fine, dont worry about it.
__label__neutral Yeah-no, stop apologizing, its okay.
__label__non-neutral Yeah!
__label__neutral Ill talk to you tomorrow.
__label__neutral I should uh, probably go.
__label__non-neutral Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
__label__neutral I forgot my purse.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral No, I really did forget my purse.
__label__neutral A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.
__label__joy I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
__label__neutral Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
__label__neutral I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
__label__non-neutral Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. IWhat?  No! Wh What are you doing?!!
__label__surprise ....and 12, 22, 18, four...  What?
__label__joy I spelled out boobies.
__label__neutral Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
__label__neutral Ah, were out. I sold them all.
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral Monica, Im cutting you off.
__label__sadness No.
__label__non-neutral No, just, just, just a couple more boxes.
__label__fear It-it-its no big deal, all right, Im-Im cool.
__label__non-neutral You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
__label__disgust Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
__label__non-neutral Oh God!
__label__neutral So, how many have you sold so far?
__label__surprise Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
__label__surprise Oh my God, how did you do that?
__label__joy Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as Laser Floyd was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!
__label__joy Thats when it occurred to me, the key to my success, the munchies. So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight.
__label__joy I am selling cookies by the case.
__label__joy They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'
__label__neutral Okay, stop what youre doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
__label__surprise Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
__label__joy Me! On my computer.
__label__neutral Like an eclipse.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__surprise Hey.  Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
__label__neutral Why not? Its built into the price of the room.
__label__surprise Yeah but you dont needWhat is this?
__label__joy Thread!
__label__joy Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
__label__non-neutral What disposable cameras?
__label__surprise The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
__label__non-neutral No you didnt.
__label__surprise Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said
__label__neutral Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check.
__label__neutral And then you said, "Why do they call it a check?
__label__neutral Why not a Yugoslavian?"
__label__neutral Yeah, then you did that.
__label__surprise So you dont have the cameras?!
__label__sadness No. Sorry man.
__label__non-neutral So? What? What? Theyre gone! Monicas gonna freak!
__label__neutral Well, Im sure theyre still somewhere here in the hotel. Ill-Ill help you look for them.
__label__non-neutral Great.
__label__neutral In-in three minutes.
__label__neutral Uhh, Rachel, my parents
__label__joy Ohh! Its so nice to meet you.  Hello.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hello.
__label__non-neutral Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is notthats-thats not what it is.
__label__neutral See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually.
__label__neutral Its-its, theyre-theyre wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at
__label__neutral Maybe in L.A?
__label__joy Yes!
__label__neutral There you go.
__label__neutral So, have you kids eaten yet?
__label__neutral Well, we were going to do that afterI mean umm, next.
__label__neutral Well, were starving, why dont we all go get something to eat?
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, well Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin around the house.
__label__neutral So We go eat.
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__neutral Youll wear that. Well be eating, and of course, youll be wearing that.
__label__neutral Well I guess I shouldve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__non-neutral Yep! Looks like its gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
__label__anger Enough!
__label__non-neutral Lean-lean-lean!
__label__neutral Let me see that.
__label__neutral This one right here.
__label__neutral Triscadecaphobia.
__label__neutral The fear of
__label__neutral No! No, fear of the number 13.
__label__neutral Fear of
__label__neutral Its possible, they have really sharp edges.
__label__neutral All right Chandler, youre up.
__label__non-neutral Wait a minute, I-I believe Im entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
__label__anger This game makes no sense!
__label__joy Yknow what? Youre just upset because youre losing.
__label__non-neutral Oh come on Ross, I think were all losers here.
__label__neutral All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
__label__anger Let me think. Let me thinkOh! I dont care.
__label__neutral You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
__label__neutral Either, it makes no difference.
__label__anger Choose, you jackass!
__label__neutral Ill take a card.
__label__joy Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Rosss points!
__label__surprise What?!
__label__joy This game is kinda fun.
__label__non-neutral You dont think its a little crazy that you get all my points just cause you
__label__neutral I dont think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
__label__surprise Hello?  Oh, hi Ross!  See? Other people call me!
__label__joy Very funny Ross!
__label__neutral Very life-like and funny.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady.
__label__surprise Whoa, maybe I was!
__label__non-neutral Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
__label__joy Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
__label__joy Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that.
__label__fear Okay, here goes.
__label__neutral How  you  a-doin'?

__label__disgust Tell me about it, huh?  Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica!  Ewwuck!
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__joy Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
__label__neutral See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
__label__joy Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful.  Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
__label__non-neutral Oh come on guys, its not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And

__label__surprise Am I naked again?!
__label__neutral Were supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
__label__neutral Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
__label__surprise Wh?! What about my allergies?!
__label__neutral Oh right, your allergies.  All her, she hates you.

__label__joy Yeah baby!
__label__joy So we never got to hear about your wedding!
__label__non-neutral We were surprise that we werent invited.
__label__neutral No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
__label__joy Whats not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__joy Hey!

__label__surprise You got Rachel pregnant?!
__label__surprise Who did?!
__label__anger You did!
__label__fear Yes. Yes, yes I did.  But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
__label__anger Oh? Really? Thats what my daughter means to you? Nothing?
__label__fear No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I careI-I love Rachel.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral Oh but not that way. I meanI mean Im not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.
__label__anger Oh really? Thats how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?
__label__anger Hey! I offered to marry her!

__label__neutral Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
__label__neutral I could have birds.
__label__neutral Okay, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
__label__neutral Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
__label__neutral All right, bye-bye.
__label__neutral Okay, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
__label__neutral We'll give you Janice.
__label__neutral I miss Janice though.  "Hello, Chandler Bing."
__label__surprise "Oh, my, god."
__label__joy "Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
__label__neutral Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
__label__joy We won. We won!
__label__neutral Mr. Heckles.
__label__neutral How did this happen?
__label__neutral He musta been sweeping. They found a broom in his hand.
__label__non-neutral That's terrible.
__label__neutral I know. I was sweeping yesterday. It coulda been me.
__label__neutral Sure, you coulda. You never know.
__label__neutral You never know.
__label__sadness Oh, I'm sorry.
__label__neutral Where's Chandler?
__label__neutral Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
__label__joy I'm free! I'm free!
__label__neutral That oughta do it.
__label__non-neutral Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
__label__surprise Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
__label__neutral Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
__label__surprise I didn't know there were docks.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__sadness Aww, is it broken?
__label__non-neutral No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
__label__neutral Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
__label__non-neutral Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
__label__non-neutral Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
__label__surprise What is this? Fruit?
__label__neutral Monica's making jam.
__label__joy Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
__label__neutral Because the kids need new shoes.
__label__neutral I'm going into business people.
__label__non-neutral I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard.
__label__non-neutral I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.
__label__neutral What's the opposite of man?
__label__neutral Jam.
__label__fear Oh Joey don't!
__label__non-neutral It's way to hot.
__label__neutral This will just be my batch.
__label__non-neutral Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
__label__surprise Why? Do you think hes still mad at us?
__label__neutral Well hes probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
__label__surprise What? Mine arent tinted.
__label__neutral Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
__label__neutral I will have one.
__label__neutral Okay, Im not gonna have one.
__label__neutral Neither will I.
__label__non-neutral No, no, its just my tooth.
__label__neutral All right Ill have one.
__label__neutral So whats a matter, you need a dentist? Ive got a good one.
__label__fear No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him.
__label__neutral See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
__label__surprise Why? Why cant you go to him?
__label__non-neutral Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
__label__joy That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienists blouse.
__label__surprise Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob.
__label__surprise And all these people actually died?
__label__non-neutral Yes, while I was in the chair!
__label__neutral Thats why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, its not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
__label__neutral Pheebs, come on, you didnt kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.
__label__neutral Its, its, its just ah, a coincidence.
__label__non-neutral Well tell that to them. Oh! You cant, their dead.
__label__surprise Hello?
__label__neutral Ross.
__label__non-neutral Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
__label__sadness It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
__label__joy No, no, that-that, thats all right. Umm, Im just glad you called.
__label__non-neutral Ross umm, theres something that Ive got to tell you, theres-theres someone else.
__label__non-neutral Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
__label__non-neutral You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
__label__sadness Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
__label__neutral So, let's go.
__label__neutral Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
__label__neutral Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.
__label__neutral You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
__label__neutral Okay, Ive got three of my five.
__label__neutral Three of your five, what?
__label__neutral Celebrities Im allowed to sleep with.
__label__surprise Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
__label__neutral Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left.
__label__neutral All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
__label__joy Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
__label__surprise Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
__label__neutral Susan Sarandon.
__label__disgust Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
__label__joy And!! Isabella Rosselini.
__label__joy Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around.
__label__neutral So?
__label__neutral So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time.
__label__neutral Yeah, cause thats why you wont get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
__label__non-neutral Oh thats five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesnt she want to come out?
__label__neutral Yknow what I think it is?
__label__neutral I think youve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesnt want to leave.
__label__non-neutral Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
__label__neutral Twenty-one hours, youre a hero.
__label__non-neutral Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
__label__neutral Actually, I think youre ready to go to the delivery room.
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral Ten centimeters, youre about to become a mom.
__label__surprise My God. Okay.  Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
__label__neutral Are they here yet?
__label__neutral No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral May I see your boarding pass?
__label__neutral Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
__label__neutral Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
__label__neutral No, I know, but Ihe just went on.
__label__non-neutral He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
__label__anger No no no! Federal regulations!
__label__neutral OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is
__label__neutral Alright. What's the message?
__label__neutral Uh... I don't know.
__label__neutral Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
__label__surprise : Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about!
__label__anger There's no Rachel!
__label__non-neutral Don't give me that deep freeze.
__label__neutral Here's the thing, Janice.
__label__neutral You know, I mean, it's like we're different.
__label__non-neutral I'm like the bing, bing, bing.
__label__neutral You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
__label__surprise Ow!

__label__neutral Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Hey, I didnt make up the rules.
__label__neutral Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card.
__label__neutral Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.
__label__surprise Dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getNo way!
__label__sadness Im, Im sorry you didnt get to go to Spacecamp, and Im hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it.

__label__neutral She lives so close.
__label__neutral And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasif she was kidding was very funny.
__label__non-neutral On the other hand, if she wasnt kidding, shes not fun, shes stupid, and kind of a racist.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hey, man!
__label__joy Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
__label__non-neutral Damn!
__label__neutral Oh heres a whole bunch.
__label__neutral Oh, I mean shes gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl."
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__sadness Then shell have to come back here and live all alone.
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and its positive. Monicas pregnant.  So I guess she wont be totally alone.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__sadness Listen, Im sorry about that whole thing with Roger.
__label__non-neutral It really wasnt right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think youll really enjoy.
__label__neutral Now, this is just a loan.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral Im gonna, Im gonna want him back.
__label__neutral So  Im gonna go now.
__label__sadness Im sorry, I thought I could do it and I cant!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__non-neutral All right, well why dont I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
__label__neutral Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
__label__neutral All right ladies, heres what were gonna do.
__label__non-neutral I-I wanna be with her,  I like her.
__label__non-neutral Oh, thats fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
__label__surprise Wait, now, what am I doing again?
__label__anger Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
__label__neutral Hi, Im Joshua, Im here to pick up Rachel.
__label__anger No-no-no, that not Joshua.
__label__non-neutral What do you want from me, Ive never met the guy.
__label__sadness So anyway, Rachel, Im sorry you cant stay,  but the rest of us have a
__label__neutral How do I look?
__label__neutral Oh, uh, I... don't... care.
__label__neutral Ok, now, remember, no trading.
__label__neutral You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
__label__joy Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
__label__neutral ...And what did you bring?
__label__neutral She's checking the coats.
__label__neutral Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands.
__label__neutral Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
__label__surprise Janice?
__label__surprise Oh.... my.... God.
__label__non-neutral Hey, it's Janice.
__label__non-neutral Well, okay so, I dont have it all worked out quite yet. Just dont say anything to Rachel, please?
__label__neutral Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
__label__non-neutral Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
__label__non-neutral Hey Rach!
__label__surprise What was that?!
__label__neutral Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
__label__neutral I havent seen it yet!
__label__non-neutral Well then youd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
__label__anger Noooooooo!!
__label__joy Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
__label__neutral Uh, okay, Pheebs?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__joy All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
__label__non-neutral Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
__label__joy Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
__label__joy Yeah, all of us! All day!
__label__disgust That sucks!
__label__non-neutral That's not a trip!
__label__non-neutral I just came from the park!
__label__non-neutral What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park?
__label__non-neutral "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
__label__non-neutral Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
__label__surprise Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!!
__label__surprise Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey!
__label__anger Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I justy'knowstop it!
__label__non-neutral I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
__label__disgust That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
__label__disgust Makes me wanna puke!
__label__neutral Is she in there?
__label__neutral Yeah. Shes putting her down now, thats her.
__label__neutral Oh its all right.
__label__sadness Im guess Im just done with the whole dating thing.
__label__sadness Its one more thing in my life thats suddenly completely different.
__label__sadness This is hard.
__label__neutral Yeah I know.
__label__neutral On the other hand in um, in about seven months youre gonna have something that youre gonna love more than any guy youve ever gone out with.
__label__neutral Just wait.
__label__joy Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger.
__label__joy You have no idea.
__label__neutral Thanks sweetie.
__label__neutral You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?
__label__sadness Oh no, I think Im gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
__label__non-neutral Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
__label__neutral Oh you did, there are twenty in here.
__label__neutral Right. Good night.
__label__neutral Good night.
__label__neutral Hi
__label__joy Hi!  Hey mom.
__label__joy This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
__label__surprise Jack?
__label__surprise Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?
__label__neutral Thats a good question, dad. Thats a good question
__label__neutral Hmmm.
__label__joy Congratulations you two!
__label__joy Thank youwere so excited
__label__joy And also, congratulations on your wedding.
__label__surprise WhaWhat?
__label__non-neutral Look at this clown!
__label__disgust Just because hes got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.
__label__anger Get out of the way jackass!
__label__disgust Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?
__label__neutral That
__label__surprise What are they doing out here? The coasts all the way over there.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__surprise Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
__label__non-neutral Dude! What are yoyou trying to kill me?!
__label__non-neutral Ow!
__label__neutral Really?! Well, its just like everyone elses apartment. Its got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
__label__neutral Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Oh my God!
__label__neutral Ah well, this is the living room.
__label__neutral Impressive.
__label__neutral All right. This is the kitchen.
__label__non-neutral Oh, thats real pretty. Wait a minute, dont I get to see the bedroom?
__label__neutral The bedroom. Well its pretty much your typical...  bedroom.
__label__neutral Were still on this side of the door.
__label__neutral Um-hmm.
__label__sadness Yeah, but I didnt get to see it.
__label__neutral Oh shoot! Maybe next time.  Thanks for a lovely evening.
__label__non-neutral So um, who was she?
__label__neutral Oh,  that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
__label__neutral Did you like her? And Im just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
__label__neutral Well, you seem fine.
__label__neutral Well, I dont think this, y'know.
__label__disgust No, no, no, I wouldnt do you myself, I mean that would be weird.
__label__neutral Yeah, no, Ill get one of the other girls to do it.
__label__joy Oh, this will be so much fun!
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__joy Are you excited?
__label__neutral Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
__label__neutral Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
__label__neutral All I have is, is oregano and a
__label__joy Um, that's ok!  Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
__label__neutral Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
__label__neutral Can we just start throwing things in?
__label__neutral Ok, yeah, ok.  Oh, OK.
__label__neutral Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
__label__neutral Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
__label__non-neutral Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
__label__surprise Hey he's wearing a sweater.
__label__neutral No.
__label__disgust Eww!
__label__neutral And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
__label__neutral Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
__label__neutral Mona?  Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be?
__label__sadness I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
__label__neutral Oh, its okay.
__label__non-neutral No, its still wet.
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__neutral Let me get it out before it sets.
__label__neutral Ooh, I have something you can wear.
__label__neutral Here.
__label__non-neutral Oh umm, I-I dont know if I want to wear a womans shirt.
__label__neutral No-no thats a mans shirt.
__label__neutral Its awfully pink.
__label__joy Oh, it's perfect!
__label__neutral How about you?
__label__neutral It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
__label__neutral All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
__label__disgust We are bad people.
__label__surprise He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew!  You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Lets get the show on it!
__label__neutral Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
__label__neutral Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and its sooo close.
__label__neutral Closer than here?
__label__non-neutral Oh, hey, look, I found coffee!  Okay, lets skedaddle.
__label__neutral Wait, Im not just gonna drink somebodys old coffee.
__label__neutral Okay, your highness.
__label__surprise Um, Rachel Im really sorry.  Thats okay, do you wanna get back together?  Yeah, okay.  Did anyone else hear that?!
__label__surprise So how did you know I was even here?
__label__neutral Your mom called me. So is this her?
__label__neutral No, this is a loaner.
__label__neutral I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
__label__neutral I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game?
__label__neutral Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
__label__neutral Yeah, they're not so bad.
__label__neutral Im sorry I wont be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but Im
__label__non-neutral I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didnt want him to start yelling at me like I was some 74 Latour.
__label__non-neutral Its Lafite. The 74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
__label__fear All right here he comes. Im gonna do this, Im gonna tell him, Im gonna be strong.
__label__neutral I just called a friend of mine.
__label__surprise Yeah?
__label__neutral I think I may be able to book
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__non-neutral What is it sweetie?
__label__sadness Theres not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__sadness Im sorry daddy.
__label__non-neutral I dont believe this!!
__label__fear Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
__label__anger Stay calm?!!
__label__anger How do you expect me to stay calm?!
__label__anger This is unacceptable Rachel!
__label__anger And I wanna know why?!!
__label__anger Is it because that punk Ross wont marry you?!
__label__non-neutral Thats it!
__label__anger Is that it?
__label__non-neutral !
__label__sadness Yes. Yes, he says Im damaged goods.
__label__surprise So, youre like a zillionaire?
__label__surprise And youre our age. Youre our age.
__label__neutral Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
__label__neutral What like Pete Dakota?
__label__neutral Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
__label__neutral Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
__label__neutral Thats not a state Joe.
__label__neutral Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
__label__neutral I got to go, so ah, Ill see you guys later.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__surprise Youre our age!
__label__neutral So ah, we on for tomorrow?
__label__joy Absolutely!
__label__joy Now get out of here you!!
__label__non-neutral Okay, Im running out of places I can touch him!
__label__sadness Look, is there something wrong with me?
__label__sadness I mean why am I only attracted to guys where theres no future?
__label__sadness Either theyre too old, or theyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me, and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on!
__label__sadness I mean, seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me?
__label__neutral !
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Okay, Im gonna go get Frank.
__label__neutral So, were walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, Hey, lets go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes, remember?
__label__non-neutral And then, and then, you turn to me and say, Nah, lets just hang out at your place. Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
__label__neutral Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
__label__anger You know what else Im not gonna miss?
__label__anger "Im Monica.
__label__anger I wash the toilet 17 times a day.
__label__anger Even if people are on it!"
__label__anger "Hi Im Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, Id better wash it and shrink it!"
__label__anger "Im Monica, I dont get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
__label__non-neutral Hey! I call her!
__label__anger "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
__label__anger "Oh my God, I cant find a boyfriend!
__label__anger So I guess Ill just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
__label__neutral Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
__label__neutral Item J437-A, color: winterberry.
__label__neutral Hi umm, listen come here, come in.
__label__sadness Im so-so sorry about yesterday.
__label__sadness I-Im really sorry.
__label__non-neutral Its just that I
__label__neutral Listen Ross, you dont have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
__label__surprise You do?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, you still have feelings for me.
__label__joy And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you.
__label__sadness And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we cant.
__label__sadness Its too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasnt meant to be.
__label__non-neutral Oh God youre right.
__label__sadness Ross, wewe have to be strong. Okay, I-Im gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Im telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
__label__neutral Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I dont want to make it savory.
__label__neutral Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
__label__neutral Gimme this.
__label__neutral Hi! Okay, dont be mad at me, but I couldnt resist.
__label__surprise Brides magazines?
__label__neutral Yes, and I know that youd say no if he asked you, but Im sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
__label__non-neutral Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.
__label__non-neutral It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.
__label__non-neutral I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean I cant.
__label__non-neutral Right?
__label__non-neutral I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral I know.  I need more pie.
__label__neutral Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
__label__surprise You didnt break up with that fireman?
__label__neutral No, that was my way of telling you.
__label__neutral Well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.
__label__neutral He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
__label__surprise Wow!
__label__neutral Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
__label__neutral So then, are you going to dump Jason?
__label__neutral Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now sos Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?
__label__neutral So Its really just about the math.
__label__neutral Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
__label__anger Ok, look! Enough is enough!
__label__non-neutral No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
__label__neutral Monica, that was also true an
__label__non-neutral I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
__label__neutral But...
__label__non-neutral Look!
__label__neutral You knew this about me when you married me!
__label__neutral You agreed to take me in sickness and in health.
__label__non-neutral Well, this is my sickness!
__label__neutral Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
__label__neutral Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
__label__neutral Yeah me too, all night.
__label__surprise Really?! How come we didnt cross paths?
__label__neutral Yeah well thats because uhI stayed in my room. Yeah, you dont want to look in my hamper.
__label__surprise I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there!
__label__surprise Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker
__label__neutral Yeah, okay lets leave these two alone.
__label__disgust No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
__label__non-neutral Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
__label__neutral So.
__label__neutral So.
__label__neutral I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.
__label__neutral I mean, you know, we've never really talked.
__label__neutral I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
__label__fear I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
__label__surprise Really? Me?
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__surprise Oh my god, are you kidding?
__label__non-neutral Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
__label__neutral Well, you're not totally paranoid.
__label__non-neutral Oy.
__label__non-neutral Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
__label__neutral Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
__label__joy Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
__label__neutral I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
__label__neutral All right, Julie.
__label__neutral Bye.
__label__disgust Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.
__label__joy Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
__label__neutral Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with the one I picked first.
__label__anger Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over!
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
__label__surprise They put you in jail?
__label__non-neutral The little jail between the doors!
__label__anger Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
__label__non-neutral I know, Im sorry! But yknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
__label__non-neutral Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
__label__neutral Maybe it was the guy.
__label__non-neutral It was the ring!
__label__neutral No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
__label__neutral Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
__label__non-neutral No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
__label__neutral Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
__label__neutral Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend.
__label__surprise Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
__label__joy We can, we can go to Aruba!
__label__sadness When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.
__label__sadness You would've liked it.
__label__neutral I had a bra.
__label__neutral Hey, Dr. Farber.
__label__neutral All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
__label__surprise Oh my God! What does
__label__neutral Oh that's an eye removal machine.
__label__non-neutral All right, I'm outta here!
__label__joy I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral So were done then!
__label__neutral Almost! But first, we gotta start.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral This is a glaucoma test.
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__neutral Sit down.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral A small puff of air, now come on!
__label__fear Sure, now Im scared.
__label__neutral No, we can go together! Just dont wait too long though, okay? Cause Im outta here sometime before Friday.
__label__fear Yeah, but I dont wanna die!
__label__joy No-no, itll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
__label__neutral Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
__label__neutral Oh, hey.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Youve have lipstick right here . Thats okay, its mine, we just kissed.
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
__label__neutral No. Y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail.
__label__non-neutral Yeah!
__label__neutral Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
__label__surprise Youre building a post office?
__label__neutral No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. Its a one day job, max.
__label__surprise Okay.  My word! Those are snug.
__label__neutral Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valentes.
__label__neutral Power saw kinda got away from me there.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__non-neutral Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
__label__neutral So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?
__label__sadness I cant seem to say goodbye.
__label__surprise Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
__label__non-neutral Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
__label__neutral It was cheesecake.
__label__neutral It was fine.
__label__surprise It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  Wow!
__label__joy My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
__label__non-neutral Yknow what? Forget it!
__label__neutral Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted.
__label__neutral Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
__label__neutral Mommas Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
__label__neutral This ones from me.
__label__surprise Ahh!
__label__neutral It wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its really fun.
__label__surprise A scooter!
__label__neutral Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
__label__joy No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
__label__joy Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys?
__label__neutral For my last birthday you gave me a
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__joy Happy birthday Grandma!
__label__neutral Its better to be over the hill  then buried under it.
__label__neutral All our love Monica and Chandler.
__label__joy Thats funny, yeah!
__label__surprise No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
__label__joy No, I know! I get it! Its funny!
__label__non-neutral No, because youre not a grandmother!
__label__non-neutral No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I dont have any of those things.
__label__neutral Thats why its so funny.
__label__non-neutral All you had to do was buy the card!
__label__neutral Hey, Joey. What's going on?
__label__neutral Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
__label__non-neutral Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
__label__non-neutral Sorry. Wrong boobies.
__label__neutral Hello, Joey.
__label__non-neutral Oh! ...Hello, dear.
__label__surprise Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
__label__joy I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
__label__surprise Really?
__label__disgust No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
__label__neutral Hey, buddy.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Oh, that's attractive.
__label__non-neutral Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
__label__disgust Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
__label__neutral Oh, ah- the kid has it.
__label__anger The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
__label__neutral You gotta do it, man.
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatevercan't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
__label__anger 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
__label__anger Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
__label__anger GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
__label__anger ...Now
__label__joy Oh, look, wish me luck!
__label__neutral What for?
__label__neutral I'm gonna go get one of those  job things.
__label__neutral Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. Thats good right?
__label__non-neutral You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
__label__surprise What? Hes gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Im so glad you could make it.
__label__non-neutral Yes, thank you so much. And again, were so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
__label__non-neutral Try. Theres my little girl.
__label__neutral Shes still mad.
__label__joy Yeah I know. Isnt it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
__label__surprise Phoebe, Sandras mad at you too. It-it doesnt bother you?
__label__neutral Oh, thats veryReally very-very okay.
__label__joy Julies cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, thats about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
__label__neutral Have you felt Rachels cervix Ross?
__label__disgust No, I dont think well be doing that.
__label__disgust Were not gonna do that.
__label__neutral Well, if you like you can feel Rachels and then feel mine to compare.
__label__neutral Am I interrupting?
__label__joy Uh yes! Thank you.
__label__neutral Oh. Oh wait no.
__label__neutral Later.
__label__non-neutral No-no-dont! Dont leave me here with these people.
__label__neutral Oh uh, Im sorry.
__label__fear No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
__label__neutral Try feeding her again.
__label__neutral I already fed her.
__label__non-neutral I know, that's why I said again!
__label__fear Alright you guys, we can't turn on each other, Okay?   That's just what she wants.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral Phoebe! Rachel! Its Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.
__label__sadness Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
__label__non-neutral For what?
__label__sadness Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
__label__neutral And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
__label__surprise You al-you already had it?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
__label__sadness Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you dont have either.
__label__sadness We ruined everything.
__label__sadness Ugh
__label__non-neutral Well no, wait a minute, thats not true!
__label__joy No, what did, that was really sweet.
__label__joy And it kinda works out for the best.
__label__surprise What do you, what do you mean?
__label__joy Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!
__label__joy I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I dont even like!
__label__non-neutral Surprise
__label__non-neutral Sur-surprise.
__label__neutral Monica.
__label__non-neutral I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
__label__neutral Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.
__label__neutral Not you guys.
__label__joy You got it going on!
__label__neutral So, what are we gonna do today?
__label__neutral They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
__label__non-neutral Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
__label__non-neutral I don't think so!
__label__neutral Why not?
__label__neutral Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
__label__non-neutral I'm not always that bad!
__label__neutral Oh,
__label__surprise I punched you...?
__label__surprise And...?
__label__surprise ... Phoebe...?
__label__neutral ... and...?
__label__non-neutral I clunked your heads together!
__label__sadness Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
__label__neutral Oh, thats okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__sadness I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a fire.
__label__surprise What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?!
__label__neutral Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.
__label__fear All right. Did everyone get out okay?
__label__neutral Well, the giraffes okay. And so is the pirate.
__label__surprise Ohh. What is this?
__label__fear No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under there!!
__label__non-neutral Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey! How long until Petes fight?
__label__neutral Oh, about five minutes. Right now theyre interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
__label__neutral Hot dog?
__label__fear Four, please.  Im really nervous.  Thank you.
__label__neutral So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
__label__neutral What?
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__joy I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really terrific.
__label__sadness Ohh, thats too bad!
__label__non-neutral No, I-Im saying I liked her.
__label__neutral Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
__label__non-neutral Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again.
__label__disgust Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
__label__neutral Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?
__label__neutral Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
__label__joy Hey, the fights starting!
__label__neutral Okay, well be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
__label__non-neutral Nine times!
__label__neutral Okay, I had to put on lotion!
__label__neutral But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
__label__neutral Fights over!
__label__neutral Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesnt want to get married?
__label__non-neutral Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.
__label__non-neutral Hi guys!
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral What are you up too?
__label__neutral Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites.
__label__neutral Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
__label__neutral Yeah, Big Brother.
__label__neutral Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
__label__neutral Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
__label__non-neutral Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
__label__neutral Eh
__label__sadness Okay well thats good to know.
__label__joy The Mr. Bowmonts here!!!
__label__joy Oh thats great, my friend Joeys in the movie business.
__label__neutral Yknow who I ran into from school? Howie.
__label__neutral My friends name is Joey.
__label__neutral Apparently Howies editing now.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
__label__surprise Can you believe that?!
__label__surprise Yknow I-I-I havent spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
__label__disgust Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie.
__label__disgust No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
__label__disgust The nerve huh?
__label__disgust Yeah!
__label__neutral Refill?
__label__non-neutral Hey! How you doing?
__label__joy Good! Good, long time no see.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Like your sweater.
__label__neutral Oh hey, right back at ya.
__label__surprise Oh, its crazy about Rachel huh?
__label__surprise Yeah. SheWell, shes one crazy lady?
__label__neutral So whose is it?
__label__neutral Umm, I dont some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral He is so weird.
__label__surprise You wanna fool around with Joey?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't    get it out of my head!
__label__surprise And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
__label__surprise Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
__label__neutral Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
__label__neutral Who, who are they?
__label__neutral I know them from work.
__label__surprise Both of them?
__label__neutral No, one of them...
__label__neutral Which one?
__label__neutral I don't know, what were the names I just said?
__label__non-neutral Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
__label__sadness All right, all right, you're right
__label__surprise What the hell are you cooking!
__label__surprise Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
__label__surprise Fire alarm?  Oh! Hi, officerfireman, can-can I help you?
__label__non-neutral We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
__label__non-neutral Thats not mine.
__label__non-neutral Yes it is.
__label__fear How do you know?
__label__disgust The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, dont wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
__label__anger Okay do youOkay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
__label__non-neutral Please reattach this, its against the law to disconnect them.
__label__non-neutral Fine!  But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
__label__neutral Theres a reset button under the plastic cover.
__label__surprise Theres a reset button?!
__label__joy Ugh, thank you!
__label__joy Thank you!
__label__surprise Theres a reset button!
__label__surprise My God!
__label__surprise Why didnt I see that!
__label__neutral Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button?
__label__joy Oh here it is!
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__joy Ohh, God!
__label__neutral Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
__label__anger Ring dammit, ring!
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__surprise Hey, you know our phone's not working?
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
__label__anger I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
__label__neutral Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.
__label__non-neutral Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
__label__anger Nngghhh!!!!!!!
__label__neutral Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
__label__neutral "Heating device."
__label__neutral Radiator.
__label__neutral Five letters.
__label__neutral Rdtor.
__label__surprise Yeah, is Sidney there?  Oh, this is?  Sidney's a woman.
__label__neutral Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
__label__neutral Well, how long do you think it'll be?
__label__neutral Any minute now.
__label__non-neutral Hey, this-  Heyy...
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey! Any good mail?
__label__neutral Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild.
__label__neutral Ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, Im kinda.
__label__neutral "Benefits lapsed."
__label__neutral Hmm thats weird. I dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
__label__neutral Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year.
__label__surprise Let me see that!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__surprise Oh, I cant believe this!
__label__anger This sucks!
__label__non-neutral When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow?
__label__non-neutral And it wouldnt matter.
__label__non-neutral Now I gotta be careful?
__label__non-neutral !
__label__non-neutral Im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire.
__label__non-neutral All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see my agent.
__label__neutral Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
__label__non-neutral look both ways before you cross the street.
__label__surprise I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
__label__joy I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
__label__neutral Y'know what else I can't believe?
__label__neutral I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
__label__neutral Do you know anything about women?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral That's all right.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__joy Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
__label__joy Yeah. He could row like a viking.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Mmm.
__label__neutral So how'd it go?
__label__neutral Oh, y'know..
__label__neutral Did he mention us?
__label__sadness He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
__label__sadness You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
__label__joy ...love you.
__label__neutral Are you're hands still wet?
__label__non-neutral Uh, moist, yeah.
__label__neutral Let's dry 'em again.
__label__non-neutral Oh my God! Oh my God!!
__label__surprise Still crying?
__label__neutral Like a
__label__neutral Yknow, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
__label__neutral Whats the other one?
__label__neutral I dont know, Ive never had to use the other one.
__label__neutral Im just saying yknow, if were having sex, hes not gonna be talking.
__label__non-neutral Oh thats right.
__label__neutral Youre the talker.
__label__joy Anyway uh, great idea!
__label__neutral Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
__label__neutral Oh, we have some
__label__non-neutral No you dont!
__label__neutral Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up.
__label__joy Great!
__label__neutral Yeah, what town are we near?
__label__neutral Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
__label__non-neutral Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route were on?
__label__neutral Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
__label__neutral Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?
__label__non-neutral I dont know, Im sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?
__label__neutral Okay!
__label__neutral Yeah, no they dont do that.
__label__non-neutral Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
__label__non-neutral Who?
__label__fear I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?
__label__neutral I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
__label__anger No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
__label__fear But if...
__label__anger No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, youll have to think of something else.
__label__joy Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
__label__non-neutral So the going for help went well?
__label__neutral Im telling you man, I saw it.
__label__anger Yeah, well, youre wrong! Okay, youre wrong.
__label__non-neutral Im not wrong! I wish I was. Im sorry. Bet that barium enema doesnt sound so bad now, huh?
__label__neutral I know.
__label__neutral Lets try a lookof far offwonderment.
__label__joy Okay, well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and the days to come.
__label__surprise Chandler!
__label__surprise What is the matter with your face?!
__label__non-neutral I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!"
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__anger Dont laugh at him!
__label__neutral Hes
__label__joy Aww!
__label__non-neutral Thats it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
__label__joy Were gonna find love!
__label__joy Definitely!
__label__neutral Yeah, Im pretty confident about that.
__label__joy Thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
__label__neutral It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
__label__neutral What do you mean?
__label__neutral Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.
__label__neutral You mean a backup?
__label__joy Exactly!
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah I got that.
__label__neutral You do?
__label__neutral Hm-mmm.
__label__neutral Who?
__label__neutral Joey.
__label__surprise Joey?!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__surprise Are you serious?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I locked him years ago!
__label__surprise Wh So If neither of you are married by the time youre 40, youre gonna marry Joey.
__label__neutral Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
__label__surprise Oh, seriously?
__label__neutral Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
__label__neutral Yeah, Im sorry man.  You wanna go watch?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Good morning.
__label__non-neutral Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
__label__joy Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
__label__non-neutral Ohh thats nice.
__label__joy Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
__label__disgust Wo-women? You mean like old women?
__label__neutral Well kinda old, like 30.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__surprise And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
__label__surprise Thats great! Wow man, so Joey mustve really taught you some stuff huh?
__label__neutral A little.
__label__surprise Yeah?
__label__neutral How you doin?
__label__joy Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
__label__neutral I know.
__label__non-neutral So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
__label__surprise What did you just say?
__label__joy You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
__label__surprise Are you serious?!
__label__joy Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
__label__joy I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
__label__joy Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!
__label__joy Whoa!
__label__non-neutral Where have I heard that before?
__label__neutral Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas.
__label__neutral I guess it must've been some movie I saw.
__label__neutral What do you say?
__label__joy Okay!
__label__joy Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
__label__non-neutral Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
__label__neutral It went under the table.
__label__non-neutral Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
__label__joy All right!
__label__joy Here it is! Here it is!
__label__neutral That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
__label__neutral It's a four.
__label__neutral I think so too.
__label__joy Well thats it. Im done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats.
__label__joy Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you.
__label__neutral Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
__label__neutral Is there anything we can do for you?
__label__neutral No just, nobody press on my stomach.
__label__neutral You can keep those pants by the way.
__label__surprise Whoaheywh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
__label__neutral Yeah, you want some?
__label__joy Ah, just cut me a little sliver.
__label__neutral A little bigger.
__label__neutral Little bigger.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral Are you afraid youre gonna run out?!
__label__anger Cut me a real piece!
__label__surprise Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
__label__neutral I need to talk to you, its pretty urgent. Its about Monica and Chandler.
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__neutral Of course, of course.
__label__neutral Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?
__label__neutral Umm, do you know each others hometowns?
__label__non-neutral Why dont you   Wh-whats going on?
__label__neutral Well, umm, not much.
__label__neutral But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow?
__label__neutral So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
__label__neutral Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler?
__label__neutral NothingWhy?!
__label__anger Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
__label__neutral Oh yeah it is! Im going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
__label__anger Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
__label__neutral Oh, Im sorry. Im so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
__label__non-neutral Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this.
__label__fear Okay,  I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life without you.
__label__sadness Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.
__label__sadness Your good heart Rach,  and, and....
__label__neutral No.
__label__sadness I cant, youre a totally different person to me now.
__label__sadness I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.
__label__non-neutral God, and now I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant,  it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.
__label__sadness Its just changed, everything.
__label__sadness Forever.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, but this cant be it, I mean.
__label__sadness Then how come it is?
__label__neutral Windows are clean, candels are lit.
__label__non-neutral Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt.
__label__neutral Did I turn the fish?
__label__neutral No, cause I made lasagne.
__label__non-neutral Am I out of control?
__label__neutral Just a touch.
__label__non-neutral Mon, I don't understand.
__label__surprise I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms?
__label__surprise I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
__label__neutral What?
__label__non-neutral Could tonight be the Night?
__label__neutral I don't know.
__label__non-neutral Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know.
__label__non-neutral Things happen, and they happen.
__label__neutral You don't plan these things.
__label__neutral So, did you shave your legs?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__surprise A-ha!
__label__non-neutral Ross!
__label__non-neutral Ben!   I mean, Ben! Ben!
__label__neutral Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
__label__fear Uh-oh.
__label__non-neutral Is there a problem?
__label__non-neutral Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato.
__label__neutral But that's okay, no problem.
__label__neutral No problem.
__label__non-neutral Hmm, noodle soup.
__label__neutral Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
__label__surprise Oh, what did I say?
__label__neutral Hmm, noodle soup.
__label__surprise How's that different?  Oh! Yeah!
__label__neutral All right, let's try one.
__label__neutral Hmm, noodle soup.
__label__neutral Okay. Let's do it again.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Hmm, soup.  I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
__label__anger COME ON!!!!
__label__non-neutral Y'know what? We need to move on.
__label__anger No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look!  Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
__label__neutral Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Give her some money.
__label__neutral I really think theyre out of rooms.
__label__anger Theyre not!! Ross, theyre just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
__label__neutral Well then wed be in a lot of trouble, you dont know where any countries are.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?
__label__neutral This is a hospital.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__non-neutral Id have to say I really dont care for your tone.
__label__anger And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem toWhoa!
__label__surprise Oh gosh!
__label__surprise Whoa!
__label__surprise What-what?
__label__surprise Ow! Ow! Contraction.  Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
__label__neutral Would you like to see a semi-private room?
__label__neutral Yeah, it couldnt hurt to look.
__label__neutral I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
__label__non-neutral That's funny. Who are they?
__label__neutral The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
__label__surprise You mean they're lovers.
__label__neutral If you wanna put a label on it.
__label__surprise Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
__label__non-neutral Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
__label__neutral Okay, quick and painful.
__label__fear Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
__label__surprise Oh, what? What-what?
__label__neutral Y'know Marcel?
__label__neutral ...Yeah?
__label__non-neutral Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
__label__joy Hi Pheebs!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral How are ya?
__label__neutral Good.
__label__neutral Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guys cell phone?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__non-neutral And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
__label__fear Ooh, now you lost me.
__label__anger You stole the phone!
__label__non-neutral No I didnt!
__label__non-neutral No? So youre saying that if I called it, it wouldnt ring?
__label__fear No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work!
__label__anger Phoebe!
__label__non-neutral Its not here.
__label__neutral Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why dont you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
__label__neutral How could I have left them in the copy room?
__label__anger I dont know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? Its not a perfect world! Just go please.
__label__anger Fine.
__label__non-neutral Thank you.  Hello?  I still dont get it.
__label__joy How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
__label__neutral This will be your phone.
__label__neutral That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
__label__neutral No you answer it and take pledges.
__label__surprise But I'm the host!
__label__neutral No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
__label__neutral You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
__label__neutral Well, here's your phone doctor.
__label__neutral Hey guys.
__label__surprise Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean youre going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
__label__neutral Well, hes very charming.
__label__disgust I know, hes too charming, but if you two start going out, then its just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
__label__neutral Well, youre just gonna have to try.
__label__neutral Joey, where are the

__label__neutral Phew, close one.

__label__surprise Look what happened!
__label__sadness Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up.
__label__non-neutral Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
__label__joy Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
__label__surprise Oh Im sorry! Do you need a break?
__label__non-neutral My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
__label__joy I can see it from right here. Itll cost you one husband.
__label__non-neutral Okay, Im sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
__label__non-neutral Come on more!
__label__non-neutral Oh God!
__label__neutral Yeah, you like that dont you?
__label__joy Oh yeah right there!

__label__anger Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be!
__label__neutral Huh?
__label__anger Because I sure as hell cant figure it out!
__label__neutral I talk to you and its nothin.
__label__neutral You look at me, and nothin.
__label__neutral Nothing.
__label__joy You guys make me fly! High! Okay, were gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
__label__neutral Well, that was ah...
__label__surprise What?! What are you doing?!
__label__non-neutral Do you know what just happened?
__label__neutral Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
__label__neutral No. We were in the middle of sexand
__label__non-neutral Nooo! No, thats not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world!
__label__neutral Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
__label__neutral Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
__label__surprise Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
__label__non-neutral Oh, it's not!
__label__surprise Seriously, it's moving!
__label__surprise What the hell is in there?
__label__non-neutral It's just my knitting that's all!  Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
__label__neutral There will come a time in each of your careers when youll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.
__label__neutral I had such an opportunity in the recent, present.
__label__non-neutral And Im ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually.
__label__anger Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him.
__label__non-neutral And now, hes got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me Im stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV.
__label__sadness Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__surprise Rach?
__label__neutral Ill be out in a second.
__label__joy Oh.  Its just so unexpected! II uhBoy Ill tell you its just such an honor to be nominated for a

__label__neutral Okay honey, you can finish this later were gonna be late. We gotta go.
__label__non-neutral Please, dont play the music. Just uh one more.
__label__surprise I can't believe you don't want to know.
__label__non-neutral I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
__label__neutral And Monica knows...
__label__surprise Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
__label__neutral Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
__label__non-neutral So what's it gonna be?
__label__non-neutral Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
__label__joy I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
__label__neutral Or an uncle...
__label__joy Hey Phoebe!
__label__joy Hi Pheebs!
__label__joy Pheebs!
__label__anger Fine!
__label__neutral Phoebe, what's the matter?
__label__sadness Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
__label__non-neutral Oh, right, that's me!
__label__neutral Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
__label__neutral Fine.

__label__neutral Hey.
__label__surprise Hey. What, what are you doing here?
__label__sadness Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental.

__label__neutral Destiny.
__label__neutral Sure.
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__surprise Okay.  Yikes! That one doesnt look very fulfilled.
__label__neutral Oh, thats, thats ah, one of the old ones, hes just taking it to the back.
__label__non-neutral You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
__label__neutral Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
__label__non-neutral So, what happens to the old guys?
__label__neutral Well, they go into the chipper.
__label__fear Why, do I have a feeling thats not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!!
__label__surprise Hey! Hey!!
__label__neutral Light still out?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
__label__non-neutral Oh please, they're having sex.
__label__anger Shut up!
__label__neutral So, whaddya think George is like?
__label__neutral I think he's shy.
__label__surprise Yeah?
__label__neutral Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
__label__joy Hi! Hi, Im Ross, you dont know me, but Im a big, big fan of yours. I mean,
__label__neutral Arent you with that girl over there?
__label__neutral Well, yeah, kinda.
__label__neutral Um, but thats okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so Im allowed to sleep with you.
__label__non-neutral No, no, no, its flattery.
__label__non-neutral Im sorry.
__label__non-neutral Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella.
__label__fear Dont, dont just dismiss this so fast.
__label__neutral I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
__label__neutral Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
__label__neutral Um, yeah.
__label__neutral May I see it?
__label__fear Um, no.
__label__non-neutral Come on!
__label__neutral But, okay.
__label__surprise Im not on the list!
__label__neutral Um, see, but thats not the final draft.
__label__non-neutral Its laminated!
__label__neutral Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
__label__neutral Y'know its ironic...
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral ...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
__label__neutral Were just gonna be friends.
__label__non-neutral Get out of here you lurker!  Go on! Get!
__label__joy Hey Pheebs!
__label__surprise Ohh! You made up!
__label__neutral Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
__label__joy Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
__label__disgust Ohh, get a room.
__label__neutral We have one.
__label__disgust I know. Use it.
__label__surprise Oh Mon, listen I have to ask!
__label__neutral Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
__label__neutral Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
__label__non-neutral Ohh! And Im one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
__label__neutral Well, yknow its none of my business, but arent you married?
__label__non-neutral Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Yknow I just wish we could be like on a break!
__label__non-neutral Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
__label__neutral So thats the only reason she could be here huh?
__label__neutral It couldnt have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe Im a good listener and I uh I put on a
__label__non-neutral Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__neutral I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to you later.
__label__neutral Good-bye.
__label__surprise Whoa!
__label__neutral Uh, that was your sister actually.
__label__neutral She-she thinks that youre just using me.
__label__neutral So?
__label__sadness Im sorry.
__label__surprise What are you doing here?!
__label__neutral I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Umm, okay, okay, look.
__label__non-neutral I took this picture from your fridge.
__label__non-neutral Okay, because I know that this is my Father.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.
__label__anger Now, look I deserve to know where I came from.
__label__non-neutral All right?
__label__anger So if you can help me find my Father then you should!
__label__anger Otherwise, youre just mean!
__label__anger So, just tell me the truth!
__label__non-neutral All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
__label__surprise My Father is Chuck Magioni?
__label__neutral No, no, thats just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!
__label__sadness And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats the truth.
__label__sadness Oh.
__label__neutral But umm, youre right.
__label__neutral I think that a person should know where they come from.
__label__neutral Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay.
__label__neutral Im your mother.
__label__surprise Heh?
__label__sadness Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
__label__surprise Whats happening to your accent?
__label__surprise Come again?
__label__non-neutral Whats-whats this nonsense?
__label__sadness All right, Im-Im not English.
__label__neutral Im from Long Island.
__label__non-neutral I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.
__label__sadness Im sorry.
__label__non-neutral So, if we could just get back to the lecture.
__label__neutral Umm, were there any questions?
__label__neutral About paleontology.
__label__non-neutral All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.
__label__non-neutral Obviously, I screwed up.
__label__non-neutral But what you guys think of me is really important because Im-Im hoping to get a permanent job here.
__label__non-neutral So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
__label__non-neutral Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am
__label__non-neutral Well, hello Rachel!
__label__neutral Where you going, Joe?
__label__neutral For a walk.
__label__non-neutral Oh. You mind if I join you?
__label__neutral Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.
__label__surprise Your thoughts? Plural?
__label__joy Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!
__label__neutral I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
__label__non-neutral Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??
__label__non-neutral You guys are killing me!
__label__non-neutral She's forbidden fruit!
__label__non-neutral It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?
__label__neutral Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?
__label__neutral Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
__label__non-neutral Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
__label__surprise Great novels?
__label__neutral Fine ... mediocre porn
__label__neutral Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office.
__label__neutral Now, he doesnt get in until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
__label__non-neutral Thats kinda sad.
__label__neutral Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,
__label__joy Got it!
__label__joy Lets roll!
__label__neutral Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
__label__neutral Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anythingminute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan.
__label__neutral Uh actually, Id like to speak with both of you.
__label__neutral Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
__label__neutral Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
__label__neutral Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
__label__non-neutral Oh! No problem! I
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral You are iron.
__label__joy You are steel!
__label__non-neutral Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
__label__neutral I told you, were adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
__label__surprise I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
__label__neutral Look, you and I went to different high schools...
__label__neutral Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school.
__label__neutral You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.
__label__non-neutral I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
__label__surprise They had to have that specially made?!
__label__neutral It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
__label__surprise Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
__label__surprise Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out.
__label__joy And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.
__label__neutral I-I owe her this.
__label__neutral I never let her eat.
__label__neutral Oh, you go out with him.
__label__surprise Oh, really?!
__label__neutral Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
__label__neutral Ill try.
__label__neutral Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that youre dancing with.
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah, okay.
__label__non-neutral Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown  Im trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
__label__anger Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, shes real, uh, mellow!
__label__neutral Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know
__label__anger Ross, get over it! Its not like she hates you.
__label__sadness Yeah but
__label__neutral Ross, shes not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
__label__non-neutral Huh. Yknow whats not one of a kind? A twin!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__joy Ooh, Phoebes here! Okay, lets turn out all the lights and well just watch the movie!
__label__joy Okay. HeyOoh, cool sheets!
__label__joy Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
__label__joy Sure!
__label__non-neutral He got it a flea market!
__label__disgust You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
__label__neutral And Joey?
__label__neutral How do you think she's doing?
__label__surprise Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
__label__surprise Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
__label__joy Thank you!
__label__neutral Now that Rachel's gone?
__label__non-neutral So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
__label__non-neutral Oh, god help us.
__label__surprise What?
__label__disgust Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
__label__disgust Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
__label__non-neutral What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
__label__sadness I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
__label__joy So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
__label__joy Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
__label__neutral Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
__label__surprise What do you mean?
__label__sadness Carol our sex life isits just not working
__label__joy Hey there little fella!
__label__neutral Hey, uh-hey, why dont we get some shoes on ya, huh?
__label__joy Hey, why dont you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room!
__label__joy Yay!
__label__surprise !
__label__joy Yay!
__label__joy Yay!
__label__non-neutral Seriously, our sex life I was thinking, maybe I dont know, we could try some-some new things.
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__neutral For fun?
__label__surprise Like what?
__label__non-neutral Well I dont know umm,  what if we were too tie each other up?
__label__neutral Umm, some people eat stuff off one another.
__label__disgust Nah!
__label__neutral Umm, yknow we-we could try dirty talk?
__label__neutral Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
__label__joy I love that idea!
__label__joy Hey, Sophie!
__label__non-neutral So whos idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
__label__anger Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
__label__surprise Oh my God, they took my idea!
__label__surprise That was you?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah! Okay, here you go.
__label__neutral Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
__label__surprise Oh my God, are you guys okay?
__label__surprise Are you all right?
__label__surprise Oh my.
__label__non-neutral Sit!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__surprise Oh my gosh, Joshua!
__label__neutral All those things I said about not being ready
__label__non-neutral Theyre not true?
__label__neutral No, theyre-theyre all true.
__label__non-neutral Oh.
__label__neutral But
__label__surprise Oh! Oh, I love that but.
__label__neutral You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Okay.  Every time.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
__label__neutral Yes, but, Ross you
__label__non-neutral What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
__label__sadness Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
__label__surprise Why would we do that?
__label__sadness Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
__label__neutral Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
__label__non-neutral Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
__label__surprise The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
__label__neutral The balloon?
__label__neutral No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached
__label__neutral I can't, I gotta go.
__label__surprise Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
__label__non-neutral Almost never.
__label__neutral Got the keys?
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__neutral What d'you think?
__label__neutral Lotsa things.
__label__neutral Which one do you think she is?
__label__neutral May I help you?
__label__neutral Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.

__label__neutral I think she means  'You
__label__non-neutral Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
__label__non-neutral People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
__label__neutral She could be you.
__label__neutral Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
__label__anger Okay, I'm not getting this!
__label__joy I'm totally getting it!
__label__non-neutral Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
__label__surprise What? You just click when they click.
__label__neutral Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
__label__neutral Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
__label__disgust Great. It's gym class all over again.
__label__surprise I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
__label__neutral Nooo, it wasn't.
__label__joy Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
__label__joy Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
__label__neutral I know
__label__joy Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
__label__joy I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
__label__joy The sun is out!
__label__non-neutral Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
__label__neutral Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
__label__neutral Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
__label__sadness Nooo!
__label__anger Damn it!
__label__non-neutral Walls are pretty thin, guys!
__label__non-neutral Hi uh, Im Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect Id like to donate some fluids.
__label__neutral Were actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so were not looking for applicants right now.
__label__sadness Oh thats too bad. Ive kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure theres no studies I can participate in?
__label__neutral Well, heres a schedule of whats coming up.
__label__neutral Thanks.  Well but this one starts now.
__label__neutral Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. Its a twins study.
__label__surprise But its $2,000.
__label__sadness Sorry.
__label__neutral Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
__label__non-neutral We already got the results back on that on, and theyre not good.
__label__neutral Hey! Hows it goin?
__label__neutral Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
__label__joy Yes it has! I made cookies!
__label__neutral Oh thats all right. Im still full from your homemade potato chips.
__label__non-neutral But you should eat them now because theyre hot from the oven.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Oh-ho! But not in here! Cant eat em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
__label__neutral Okay, Ill be out in a second.
__label__neutral Okay!
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral That doesnt lock does it?
__label__disgust You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
__label__neutral That saves us a conversation.
__label__non-neutral Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
__label__neutral Me too, we should get goin'.
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Oh. Mine does.
__label__neutral Okay, here comes another camera.
__label__neutral Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
__label__neutral Why do they keep doing that?
__label__neutral If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms.
__label__neutral Theyve been taping those people up there all day.
__label__neutral Right.
__label__non-neutral Hey, whatd you guys do to get up on there?
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__surprise Hey! Youre a good dancer!
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Yeah, well youd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
__label__neutral What do you mean?
__label__neutral Like this.
__label__neutral Thats it, feel the rhythm. Thats better.
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__non-neutral Okay, youre dancing with that girl over there.

__label__neutral We got some
__label__neutral Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
__label__surprise Who?  Is that your sister?
__label__neutral Ugh, she
__label__disgust God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
__label__non-neutral Oh my God, look-look hes taking off her clothes!
__label__disgust Hes taking off her coat!
__label__disgust Oh, this is just terrible.
__label__non-neutral Ross! Wait!
__label__non-neutral Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about
__label__anger You suck!!
__label__anger What?!
__label__anger Okay, break-ups still on!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__sadness Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
__label__neutral No, I dont want to hit you.
__label__non-neutral Oh what then? Kick me?
__label__neutral No.
__label__surprise My son? Pretty serious.  Oh hey Katie!  What uh, what are you doing here?
__label__neutral Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this.
__label__neutral Ah, mustve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
__label__neutral Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__fear Oh uhI actually came here to ask you out.
__label__joy Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. Im just gonna put this  back in my pocket, pretend
__label__joy Sure!
__label__anger Horny bitch.  No! Youre a horny bitch! Noooo! Youre the horny bitch! No! Youre a horny bitch!
__label__non-neutral Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
__label__neutral Well, like father, like son.
__label__joy Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
__label__surprise Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
__label__non-neutral Well, y'know, possibly.  You didnt tell him that, though? Right?
__label__neutral Ummmmmmmm, no.
__label__non-neutral You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell the guy that!
__label__non-neutral Why not?! Id be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to getoh I see.
__label__non-neutral Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea.
__label__non-neutral Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
__label__neutral Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
__label__surprise Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
__label__surprise Instead of...?
__label__neutral That's right.
__label__neutral Never had that dream.
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
__label__surprise And they weren't looking at you before?!
__label__neutral Finally, I figure I'd better answer it,
__label__joy Honey! Dinners ready!
__label__joy Whats my little chef got for me tonight?
__label__joy Your favorite!
__label__joy Ho-ho-ho,  fried stuff with cheese!
__label__joy Yep! And lots of it!
__label__joy Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here.  Okay.
__label__joy Okay, in we go.
__label__joy Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!  How you doin?
__label__neutral Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate.
__label__non-neutral So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is.
__label__neutral Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
__label__surprise Oh my god.
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
__label__neutral Come on, they're close.
__label__disgust Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
__label__neutral Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
__label__disgust Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
__label__neutral Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
__label__disgust Oh my god, what were you thinking?
__label__neutral All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__surprise Ow!
__label__disgust I'm outta here.
__label__neutral Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
__label__joy Hello! One marriage please!
__label__joy Yep, we wanna get married!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__joy Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral Oh, that's
__label__neutral No, only because that's the graduation song.
__label__joy Okay!  This is it!  We're gonna get married!
__label__neutral Are you sure you wanna do this?
__label__joy Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
__label__joy Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
__label__neutral Wait!  Okay!
__label__neutral Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
__label__neutral It depends on who asked.
__label__neutral What if I asked?
__label__neutral Oh, Mon, sure.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__surprise Yes.  Youre not asking are you?
__label__neutral No.
__label__joy Yes! Totally!
__label__joy Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
__label__joy Youarenot going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
__label__surprise He asked you out?!
__label__non-neutral No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
__label__joy Saucy!
__label__neutral What are these?
__label__neutral Electrical plans for the building.
__label__fear Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
__label__neutral I know that switch does something, okay?
__label__neutral So-so I went down to city hall and got these.
__label__non-neutral All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
__label__surprise Wow! If only more people knew.
__label__neutral Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in
__label__neutral Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
__label__neutral So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
__label__neutral Oh, nobody's judging you.
__label__non-neutral Oh! Okay!  You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!
__label__surprise Oh man!
__label__joy I want that place so much!!
__label__non-neutral I was so sure that was gonna work!
__label__disgust There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
__label__neutral All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
__label__neutral Bye!
__label__neutral Bye!
__label__sadness Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.
__label__disgust Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
__label__surprise Actually, I did!
__label__neutral Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
__label__surprise Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
__label__surprise Are you serious?
__label__non-neutral Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
__label__non-neutral Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsShe knows!
__label__fear Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
__label__neutral All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
__label__neutral No, let's just leave the lights on.
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
__label__neutral Oh fine.
__label__joy Ready?  Wrestle!
__label__neutral Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
__label__neutral All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
__label__fear Can we please focus here, a naked mans life hangs in the balance!
__label__non-neutral Im telling you hes dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
__label__neutral All right, ladies and gentlemen, lets poke.
__label__neutral Steady.
__label__neutral Steady.
__label__neutral Okay, a little higher.
__label__neutral Careful of the angle.
__label__neutral Okay, okay, were approaching the window  Thread the needle.
__label__neutral Thread the needle.
__label__joy Hes alive! Hes a-live!!!
__label__disgust And yet, were still poking him.
__label__neutral Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
__label__non-neutral He does not look happy.
__label__surprise Hey-hey, now hes showing us his poking device.
__label__non-neutral Hey, thats never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
__label__non-neutral Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other.
__label__disgust Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard.
__label__surprise Oh God oh!
__label__surprise Contraction!
__label__neutral Yeah? Okay.
__label__surprise Ooh! Ow!!
__label__non-neutral Are you looking at her?!
__label__anger No!
__label__anger Dont you look at her you sick bastard!
__label__fear Honey I swear! I wasnt looking at her!
__label__anger Shes in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!
__label__neutral Umm. Umm, Im-Im just gonna
__label__anger See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!
__label__non-neutral No-no, ImIm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.
__label__neutral You miss your girlfriend?
__label__neutral Just ignore them.
__label__neutral Ross.
__label__non-neutral What? What?
__label__neutral Hes looking at me.
__label__anger Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
__label__anger Dont you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!
__label__neutral Pat Sajak?
__label__joy Yep!
__label__neutral Alex Trebek?
__label__joy Oh, of course!
__label__neutral Chuck Woolery?
__label__joy Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, whos ass I cannot kick.
__label__joy Say it!
__label__joy Say we are unagi!
__label__non-neutral Its not something you are! Its something you have!
__label__joy Say it!
__label__non-neutral Yknow what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
__label__neutral Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
__label__neutral Yeah, it's in there.
__label__surprise Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
__label__neutral Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
__label__surprise Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
__label__surprise Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
__label__neutral Yes. Yes.
__label__surprise You?!  And-and you?!
__label__joy Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
__label__surprise How?! When?!
__label__neutral It happened in London.
__label__surprise IN LONDON!!!
__label__neutral The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
__label__non-neutral But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
__label__fear No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
__label__fear Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
__label__non-neutral All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's
__label__joy I know, it's great!
__label__disgust Aww, I don't want to see that!
__label__non-neutral We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
__label__neutral And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
__label__neutral Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
__label__neutral No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
__label__neutral Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
__label__surprise Ahh!
__label__fear What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
__label__neutral Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
__label__surprise Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
__label__neutral You got a better idea?
__label__neutral All right, call it in the air.
__label__neutral Heads.
__label__neutral Heads it is.
__label__joy Yes! Whew!
__label__neutral We have to assign heads to something.
__label__neutral Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
__label__non-neutral What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
__label__neutral Okay, some tricks of the trade.
__label__neutral Now, Ive never been able to cry as an actor, so if Im in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling.
__label__neutral Or ah, or, lets say I wanna convey that Ive just done something evil.
__label__neutral That would be the basic I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it  Okay, lets say Ive just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.
__label__neutral And thats how its done.
__label__joy Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
__label__neutral Hey, Mr. Trib.
__label__non-neutral Hey-hey.
__label__neutral Then Im gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
__label__surprise Who are you?
__label__neutral Hi, Im Eric, Im gonna be Chandlers new roommate.
__label__surprise Im Chandlers new roommate.
__label__surprise I-I-I dont think so.
__label__surprise I could be Chandlers new roommate.
__label__surprise But, he told me over the phone.
__label__neutral He told me in person.
__label__surprise Thats weird.
__label__joy Well, Im going to go into my new apartment now.  Ehh!
__label__surprise Hey! Look who I found!
__label__joy Oh, hey guys!
__label__neutral Yknow, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
__label__neutral Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
__label__neutral Or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas?
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__neutral Didnt think so!
__label__neutral Okay, cmon guys, show us where the presents are!
__label__non-neutral Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thats as good as garbage?
__label__neutral Hmm, how about my azzz?
__label__neutral Hey, this is hollow.
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise This bench, its hollow! I cant believe I never knew that!  Oh, the presents!!!
__label__fear No, dont look directly at them!
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral Alright, no, we could look at them!
__label__neutral I
__label__non-neutral Hi! Im so glad youre here, but its gonna be a while. I-I wished youd called first.
__label__neutral Oh thats all right, Im coming back later with your father.
__label__non-neutral Oh good.
__label__neutral I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
__label__neutral Okay, whats up?
__label__neutral I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.
__label__surprise Ma, youre asking me to marry you?
__label__joy This is your grandmothers engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
__label__surprise Mom no, come on! Thank you.
__label__fear Just hear me out!
__label__sadness Maybe this wouldve happened if Id been more nurturing, or Id paid more attention, or I... had a uterus.
__label__non-neutral I cant believe this!
__label__sadness I know no, no, y'know you dont deserve this, you dont Ross.
__label__sadness Youre, youre really, youre so good.
__label__sadness Thanks.
__label__neutral And youre so sweet.  And youre kind
__label__non-neutral Thanks.
__label__surprise Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
__label__surprise Huh?
__label__neutral Okay, its okay.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__non-neutral Wait, wait, wait.
__label__neutral What?
__label__non-neutral My foot is stuck in the pocket.
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral No, I cant get it out.
__label__neutral Rachel?
__label__surprise Yeah.  Hi Mark!
__label__joy Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
__label__surprise Oh, I did!
__label__joy Yes.
__label__surprise Oh my God!!
__label__joy Congratu!!  -lations-lations.
__label__anger I cant believe I did this! What an idiot!
__label__non-neutral Oh, stop beating yourself up!
__label__neutral People make mistakes!
__label__neutral These things happen!
__label__neutral There arent any message youve forgotten to give me are there?
__label__anger Apparently youre not very good at it!
__label__neutral I
__label__neutral Philadelphia.
__label__surprise Oh my God! So was she! Oh, Ive got-Ive got goose bumps.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Well, yknow Im wearing layers and its warm.
__label__neutral Yeah-yeah.
__label__non-neutral But ifno look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
__label__neutral Did you hear that?!
__label__non-neutral I dont need you guys to care about me!
__label__joy Because the universe cares!
__label__joy The whole universe!
__label__sadness I really wished theyd care just a little bit though.
__label__neutral Yknow, I dont-I dont think its you.
__label__fear This is a freaky place.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral Guys!
__label__neutral Oh no, its you.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy I like this one.  It seems to say, "I love you and thats why I have to kill you."
__label__joy They cant all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
__label__surprise Do you really want to pull at that thread?
__label__joy Im having a really good time!
__label__non-neutral Me too! Im sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.
__label__neutral Ohh. No thats okay, hes a friend.
__label__fear Hey uh, I dont mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
__label__sadness Yeah, I Well yknow I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so Id just be lost.
__label__surprise I know its really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss andOh no! No! No! My God!
__label__neutral Okay, dont freak out. Ill go.
__label__non-neutral No its Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!
__label__neutral Okay, I know. Hold on.  Hey Ross?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Yeah, umm thats Whitney , Kyles ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can yknow divert her so that we can slip out?
__label__surprise What?! No!
__label__neutral Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
__label__neutral Look, I dont think so Pheebs.  All right, Ill do it. But just because youre a friend.
__label__neutral Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
__label__neutral I'll take sports.
__label__non-neutral Mine!
__label__neutral All right. Uhh, international.
__label__neutral Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say
__label__disgust You two will have very hairy children.
__label__non-neutral Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
__label__non-neutral Ross! Janice?!
__label__neutral All right, hold on!
__label__neutral Hold on.
__label__neutral Hold on.
__label__neutral This is Ross, okay?
__label__neutral He's our friend.
__label__non-neutral He obviously went crazy.
__label__non-neutral He obviously lost his mind.
__label__non-neutral Look, I
__label__neutral So are you actually gonna see her again?
__label__anger Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
__label__neutral I
__label__anger Damnit Phoebe!!
__label__neutral Hey, dont we have to...
__label__neutral Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
__label__non-neutral Umm, I think youre really, really great...
__label__non-neutral Oh God!
__label__non-neutral Here we go again.
__label__anger Why does this keep happening to me?
__label__non-neutral Is it something Im putting out there?
__label__non-neutral Is this my fault?
__label__non-neutral Or am I just nuts?
__label__surprise I-I-I-I-I dont know, I dont know what to say.
__label__non-neutral Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
__label__non-neutral Wait!
__label__non-neutral Terry!
__label__non-neutral Please!
__label__sadness Look, I just lost my other job.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__sadness You have no idea how much I need this.
__label__sadness Please, help me out, for old times sake.
__label__sadness This poor guys been in a coma for five years. Its hopeless.
__label__joy Its not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Ramorays a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
__label__neutral Good morning.  Drake, its your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
__label__joy Im back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
__label__anger That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
__label__neutral Well you did pull his hair.
__label__anger He took my snack!
__label__anger Im not getting into this again!
__label__non-neutral Okay! Oh God, yknow what? Its really bad.
__label__anger Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.
__label__non-neutral This doesnt mean anything, does it?
__label__anger Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! Right?
__label__neutral That is true.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
__label__neutral Oh, Ive been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
__label__neutral Joey, you know you dont actually have one.
__label__non-neutral Come on! What are you doing?! Im in character! Would you talk to her!
__label__non-neutral Ahh, I think it just moved. Its really poking me.
__label__non-neutral All right, thats it, were going to the emergency room.
__label__non-neutral What?! No, you cant, you cant leave me here with them! Were baby-sitting!
__label__non-neutral The babies are asleep, Im sure youll be okay on your own for a while!
__label__non-neutral But you-you cant leave me with them! We-were a team! Were playing a zone! Theyre gonna triple team me!
__label__non-neutral Hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got to go to the hospital.
__label__neutral But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
__label__neutral I think thats gum.
__label__neutral Im pretty sure its gun.
__label__non-neutral Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go.
__label__non-neutral A real man wouldnt just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?
__label__neutral That was the only way I could get him to
__label__neutral Hi! How are the Gellers?
__label__anger Dont call us that!
__label__anger The judge wouldnt let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
__label__non-neutral Hey! Its Porsche!!
__label__joy Hey sweetie!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__surprise Theres no back to this couch!
__label__surprise Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
__label__neutral Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yknow?
__label__neutral Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think I was yknow, all dead inside.
__label__joy Oh thats so sweet! Look Chandler I dont care if you cant cry, I love you.
__label__neutral Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
__label__non-neutral Stop it!
__label__neutral No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, were up at the altar and Im like this.
__label__neutral I wont care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__non-neutral Of course he is!
__label__non-neutral What, do you think Id just use my son as-as an excuse?
__label__anger What kind of father do you think I am?
__label__neutral All right, sorry.
__label__neutral I gotta go make a fake Ben.
__label__surprise The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
__label__neutral Well, either that or uh
__label__non-neutral Joey!!
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__non-neutral Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
__label__non-neutral Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
__label__joy Yeah, and theyve been coming by all day. They love it!
__label__joy They love my candy? Oh man!!! Ive gotta go make more!!
__label__neutral Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something mightve happened to a huge chunk of it.
__label__joy Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
__label__non-neutral Mine stole my newspaper! Its like a
__label__neutral Sure!
__label__neutral Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldnt stop thinking about it.
__label__neutral I mean, everyone should have a-a
__label__surprise Oh my God Ross!!
__label__joy You like it?
__label__neutral I
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Hello darlings.
__label__joy And theres daddy!
__label__surprise There he is! There he is!
__label__neutral Where?
__label__joy Right- where we've been looking all night!
__label__joy He is so cute!
__label__joy Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
__label__joy Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop thewowww.
__label__joy I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
__label__joy Yeah, isn't he?
__label__joy It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
__label__joy You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
__label__surprise Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
__label__neutral Huh. That's nice.
__label__neutral and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve just lasted just one day, burned for
__label__neutral Eight whole days.
__label__joy Thats right, and thats why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
__label__joy Awesome!
__label__surprise Yeah?
__label__neutral My favorite part was when
__label__neutral The Armadillo was actually not so
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__surprise Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunnys funeral in here.
__label__joy Come on, come on, were-were-were lighting the candles!
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral Okay, I understand why
__label__neutral Hes says, Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, sure. Good luck!
__label__joy Im quitting!! Woo-hoo!  Im okay!! Im all right!!
__label__surprise Wow! Thats exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
__label__neutral What?
__label__surprise Im just saying, this woman, I mean shes fictitious. No?
__label__non-neutral Why would you say that?
__label__neutral Cause youre still into Monica.
__label__neutral So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
__label__non-neutral Youre good. Youre good!
__label__neutral Yeah, no, Im fairly intuitive and psychic. Its a substantial gift.
__label__fear Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though?
__label__neutral Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
__label__non-neutral Thanks a lot.
__label__neutral No Im serious. I mean Im intuitive, but my memory sucks.
__label__neutral Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
__label__anger For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
__label__neutral Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
__label__joy Oh, thanks, sweetie.
__label__joy No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__fear You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
__label__neutral No, no, they will. I just... uh...
__label__neutral Can't wait.
__label__surprise Do I know you?
__label__surprise Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
__label__neutral Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
__label__surprise You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
__label__non-neutral Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
__label__surprise Uh, wait, backstage?
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
__label__neutral Ross.
__label__neutral Chandler.
__label__neutral How are you?
__label__neutral Look, you guys wanna meet the group?
__label__neutral Come on.
__label__surprise So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
__label__disgust Do you have any respect for your body?
__label__disgust Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
__label__anger Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.
__label__neutral The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
__label__neutral Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__surprise He does?
__label__joy Hey, buddy, what's up!
__label__surprise Oh, she told you about that, huh.
__label__neutral Well, yeah, I have one now and then.
__label__neutral Well, yeah, now.
__label__neutral Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before.
__label__joy Well, okay, thanks!
__label__joy God, he's good.
__label__neutral If only he were a woman.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Hey, Frank.
__label__neutral Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didnt.
__label__neutral Theres someone here who can explain this better than I can.
__label__neutral Hi Frank.
__label__neutral Hi, Mrs. Knight.
__label__neutral Phoebes right Frank.
__label__neutral I know its hard to hear, but it wouldve been wrong to go through with it.
__label__sadness I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not.
__label__non-neutral Is that it, is that what it is?
__label__neutral Yeah, but not just that.
__label__sadness Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less
__label__neutral None the less.
__label__sadness None the less. Umm, youre too young to, to really know what you want.
__label__neutral Thats right, exactly.
__label__non-neutral All right, its a good bye kiss, thats good.
__label__neutral Bye-bye.
__label__non-neutral Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what Im saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong.
__label__non-neutral Okay, Ive decided Im gonna let this happen!
__label__neutral Okay, can I just get my purse?
__label__neutral Okay, all right, good.
__label__neutral .
__label__surprise Oh, look look look.
__label__neutral The last candle's about to burn out.
__label__neutral 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__fear Kinda... spooky without any lights.
__label__joy Bwah-hah-hah!
__label__non-neutral OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
__label__neutral Oh.. oh... oh.
__label__neutral Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
__label__neutral All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
__label__joy You blew them away!
__label__joy Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!
__label__neutral I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?
__label__surprise I was
__label__joy No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
__label__surprise Oh my God!  I'm your
__label__non-neutral I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
__label__non-neutral Look, I took it too far!
__label__neutral Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
__label__neutral Could've played
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__neutral Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
__label__neutral Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the
__label__neutral Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
__label__neutral Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.
__label__surprise Nooo!
__label__neutral Hello?
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.
__label__non-neutral Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
__label__neutral Green. To the green.
__label__neutral I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind.
__label__neutral To the left, to the left- aww!
__label__neutral Ohhh... I'm fine.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__non-neutral Please tell me you got the message!
__label__neutral What message?
__label__neutral The actor playing Mac couldnt do it, they needed to see you at 2 oclock.
__label__surprise What?! Its 6 oclock!
__label__fear Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!
__label__non-neutral I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya!
__label__neutral I went to Rosss!
__label__neutral I went to the coffeehouse!
__label__neutral I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
__label__neutral Thats the day youre gonna die? Seedarnit, Ive got shuffleboard that day.
__label__neutral Thats what you think.
__label__neutral Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers? Wouldnt they have the recipe?
__label__neutral Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
__label__neutral What was her name?
__label__neutral Nesele Toulouse.
__label__neutral Nestle Tollhouse
__label__neutral Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
__label__neutral (grabbing a bag of
__label__non-neutral Yes!!  Oh.
__label__non-neutral I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
__label__non-neutral I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!!
__label__neutral So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
__label__joy Absolutely!
__label__joy I am so on board!
__label__non-neutral Rachel didn't you just light that?
__label__neutral Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.
__label__neutral I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
__label__disgust Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
__label__neutral Tell me about it!
__label__joy Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
__label__neutral It does sound appealing.
__label__non-neutral Oh, I never could do it.
__label__neutral Oh but you could.
__label__neutral You can.
__label__joy Absolutely!
__label__joy We can help each other out!
__label__neutral We can get--what are those--those patches!
__label__joy We could be like the Patch Sisters!
__label__joy Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
__label__joy Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
__label__sadness My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.
__label__non-neutral Okay then!
__label__non-neutral I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
__label__neutral Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
__label__neutral Does, um, anyone wanna see?
__label__non-neutral Nooo!
__label__anger Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
__label__disgust It's worse than the thumb!
__label__anger Hey, this is so unfair!
__label__surprise Oh, why is it unfair?
__label__non-neutral So I have a flaw!
__label__anger Big deal!
__label__non-neutral Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?
__label__non-neutral And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?
__label__non-neutral And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?
__label__disgust I mean, what the hell is that thing?
__label__non-neutral ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
__label__non-neutral ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
__label__neutral Well, I-I could live without it.
__label__non-neutral Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
__label__neutral Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
__label__anger Oh,  "you do, do you"?
__label__neutral You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
__label__non-neutral "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
__label__neutral Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
__label__anger Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
__label__sadness Awww! Mel Torme died.
__label__neutral Joey, that papers like a year old!
__label__sadness Aw! Does that mean the
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
__label__neutral Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
__label__neutral Probably?
__label__disgust Yeah, I don't like that word.
__label__neutral Kind of what probably really means.
__label__neutral Yeah, uh-huh.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow?
__label__non-neutral I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!"
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__neutral You gotta take care of yourselves!
__label__neutral In
__label__neutral Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
__label__joy Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
__label__joy Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesnt he?
__label__neutral Hes a keeper. How are you feeling?
__label__neutral Oh, Im fine.
__label__neutral Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her all alone.
__label__neutral Oh, Im not doing it alone. I have Ross.
__label__neutral Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
__label__neutral Well then he gets a divorce, its Ross!
__label__neutral Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family.
__label__non-neutral Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.
__label__disgust Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
__label__neutral Hey. Whos that?
__label__neutral New people.
__label__neutral What happened to the Disgustingtons?
__label__non-neutral Theyre having their baby!
__label__anger Its not fair Ross we got here first!
__label__neutral Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.
__label__neutral Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
__label__surprise Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
__label__neutral Phoebe?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__surprise Look at that guy by the window, wow!
__label__neutral Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.
__label__sadness Oh, what is wrong with me lately?
__label__neutral I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here.
__label__non-neutral Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
__label__neutral Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
__label__surprise Really?! So this has happened to you?
__label__neutral Oh absolutely yeah!
__label__neutral Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
__label__non-neutral Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap.
__label__neutral Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a
__label__disgust Ugh!
__label__fear I dont know what Im going to do!
__label__anger I called the company that sent and th-they dont care!
__label__non-neutral Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is?
__label__joy Hey guys!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hey
__label__joy I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!
__label__joy And the guys from work had a blast.
__label__non-neutral Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
__label__non-neutral Yeah!
__label__surprise And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
__label__non-neutral So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, right!
__label__neutral I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those
__label__surprise That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
__label__surprise So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
__label__joy Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
__label__non-neutral So you might say, its a magic ring.
__label__surprise OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!
__label__neutral Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
__label__neutral Obviously! So, how do we decide?
__label__neutral Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should date her
__label__neutral Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
__label__non-neutral Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her
__label__neutral Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
__label__neutral Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
__label__neutral Yeah well we should order some food then.
__label__non-neutral No Joey! Look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, well
__label__neutral That sounds fair.
__label__neutral Maybe Ill take her to that new French restaurant down the street
__label__non-neutral Ah yeahwait a second now!
__label__neutral Look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.
__label__non-neutral I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
__label__neutral Well sorry, thats what I do on dates.
__label__neutral All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates.
__label__neutral So lets decide on the spending limit
__label__neutral Yeah. Uh, a slicesix dollars?
__label__neutral I was thinking more like a hundred.
__label__neutral Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
__label__neutral Hi, again.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__joy Thank you soo, much.
__label__anger Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
__label__neutral You want some help with that?
__label__neutral Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I dont!
__label__surprise Whoa! Are you okay?
__label__surprise Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
__label__neutral Its the heat.  And-and the humidity.
__label__neutral Thats a uh, thats a tough combination.
__label__neutral Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
__label__surprise Like you wouldnt believe.  Wow! This is a great place.
__label__neutral What do you mean?
__label__neutral Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__neutral Hey, somebody left their keys.
__label__surprise Ooohh, to a Porsche!
__label__surprise Transcribers note: Oh come on!
__label__surprise Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind?
__label__neutral If I had a Porsche, Id have the keys surgically attached to my hand!
__label__neutral Hey Gunther, these yours?
__label__disgust Yeah, thats what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
__label__neutral Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?
__label__neutral Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found?
__label__surprise Theres a lost and found?  My shoe!
__label__surprise You left a shoe here?!
__label__neutral Well, I didnt realize until I got home.
__label__neutral I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__neutral Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.
__label__neutral Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe.
__label__joy Great! Thanks.
__label__neutral Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
__label__non-neutral Carol, we've been through this before, ok?
__label__joy We have a good time.
__label__joy We laugh, we play.
__label__joy It's like we're father and son.
__label__joy Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
__label__joy Oh, this is so cute.
__label__neutral Oh, I got that for him.
__label__joy My mommies love me. That's clever.
__label__neutral Hello?
__label__neutral Oh, Hi, JuHi, Jew!
__label__neutral Uh huh?
__label__neutral Uh huh?
__label__neutral Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great.
__label__neutral See ya then.
__label__neutral Bye.
__label__surprise Did you just say Hi, Jew?
__label__neutral Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
__label__non-neutral Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes!
__label__joy Thanks Monica!
__label__disgust Does that smell bother you?
__label__surprise What the smell from Joeys? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
__label__neutral Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie to cover it.
__label__non-neutral I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
__label__joy Okay!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  Its for you. Its the fire inspector.
__label__surprise Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair straightener that started the fire.
__label__neutral No-no, it was the candles.
__label__non-neutral Its very not good leaving candles unattended.
__label__neutral In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay.
__label__neutral Well, I have to go now.
__label__surprise Joey proposed to me.
__label__surprise Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!
__label__fear Well, I-I said yes.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral Are you crazy?
__label__non-neutral You just had Ross's baby!
__label__non-neutral It's-it's so  inappropriate.
__label__disgust No, it's worse than that.
__label__disgust It's wrong.
__label__surprise It's… It is bigger than  mine!
__label__neutral I know.
__label__non-neutral You can't marry him!
__label__non-neutral Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.
__label__neutral Well do you love him?
__label__neutral Sure.
__label__non-neutral Sure?
__label__neutral Yeah, I mean whatever.
__label__non-neutral Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?
__label__non-neutral No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
__label__neutral So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
__label__non-neutral Here comes the bride.
__label__surprise Oh my God Monica!
__label__joy I wanna wear this everyday.
__label__joy You look so beautiful.
__label__joy Im so happy for me.
__label__neutral Hello?
__label__non-neutral Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
__label__neutral Yeah, we got him back. Everythings fine.
__label__anger Damnit!
__label__neutral Uh, yknow what?
__label__anger Ill tell you who it hurts!
__label__anger It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principals office wearing nothing but a catchers mitt!
__label__neutral That was
__label__anger I will be! Listen, I dont want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
__label__neutral Fine.
__label__non-neutral Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.
__label__non-neutral And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want!
__label__neutral No thats not what I want. Uh, Im glad you guys were bonding but I
__label__non-neutral Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff!
__label__non-neutral And I havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway!
__label__anger Crap!!
__label__neutral I gotta go!
__label__surprise Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
__label__neutral No.
__label__surprise Me neither! We have to get in!
__label__neutral Just act like you belong.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Oranges!
__label__neutral Shh!  Nice to see you again.
__label__neutral Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
__label__neutral Yes, of course.
__label__neutral Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see the seat number.
__label__neutral Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A.
__label__non-neutral Okay.  Mrs. Green! Okay Im really sorry!! Im apologizing for the  Okay, I bit my tongue, but Im
__label__joy Hey! Look whos back! Its the birthday girl! Hows the birthday girl feeling?
__label__non-neutral Well, I feel fine, but I think youre bumming out the rest of the kids.
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral Okay!
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__non-neutral I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.
__label__neutral All I really needed was a plan.
__label__neutral See I wanna have three kids
__label__non-neutral Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
__label__neutral As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time Im 35 which gives me five years.
__label__joy I love this plan!
__label__joy I wanna marry this plan!
__label__non-neutral You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed!
__label__non-neutral Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,
__label__non-neutral Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too yknow!
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
__label__neutral I dont know.
__label__disgust Why am I not surprised?
__label__anger Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this!
__label__neutral I dont think you have much choice.
__label__anger Well well see!
__label__neutral Bye-bye!
__label__neutral Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?
__label__neutral Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .
__label__neutral Dad?
__label__neutral Im here!
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
__label__sadness Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.
__label__neutral Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
__label__neutral Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
__label__sadness Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.
__label__joy Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of the memories
__label__neutral Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven
__label__neutral I used to
__label__neutral Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
__label__neutral Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a
__label__neutral Ok, got the vent open.
__label__joy Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
__label__neutral Ben, you ready?
__label__neutral All right, gimme your foot.
__label__neutral Ok, on three, Ben.
__label__neutral One, two, three.
__label__neutral Ok, That's it, Ben.
__label__neutral What do you see?
__label__neutral Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
__label__surprise Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
__label__surprise Wait! You forgot your legs!
__label__joy You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
__label__joy Thank you.
__label__neutral Filing system?
__label__surprise Oh-oh!
__label__neutral You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?
__label__joy It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
__label__neutral Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
__label__neutral I notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
__label__joy Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
__label__joy Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost
__label__neutral I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
__label__non-neutral Oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!
__label__neutral Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
__label__neutral Yes, I realize that
__label__neutral And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
__label__joy I love working with designers!
__label__neutral With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?
__label__neutral Chandler, you have an assistant right?
__label__fear Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
__label__neutral Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
__label__surprise I do?
__label__neutral Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Or not.
__label__neutral Where's Chandler?
__label__neutral Here I am.
__label__disgust Wash your hands!!!
__label__surprise How did youknow?
__label__surprise Hey! What's she doing back here?
__label__neutral Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
__label__neutral Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
__label__surprise What happened in Atlantic City?!
__label__neutral Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
__label__non-neutral Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
__label__neutral And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?
__label__neutral So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.
__label__non-neutral Now, I know what youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls.
__label__surprise You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
__label__non-neutral In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
__label__joy Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
__label__non-neutral Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
__label__neutral Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
__label__neutral So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
__label__non-neutral Of course I am!
__label__neutral Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot.
__label__neutral Ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.
__label__neutral And-and then guess what?
__label__non-neutral The babys coming and I dont know what to do.
__label__non-neutral Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
__label__neutral No. Sweetie, youre gonna be fine.
__label__non-neutral Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
__label__neutral Im going to the bathroom.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay.
__label__neutral It
__label__joy Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
__label__neutral I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
__label__neutral Not if you were here.
__label__neutral Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
__label__joy Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope its you!
__label__neutral I hope its you.
__label__joy Me too!
__label__non-neutral First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so important to me
__label__non-neutral Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
__label__neutral Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.
__label__neutral Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine
__label__joy Yes!!! Oh!!
__label__non-neutral Hypothetically!
__label__neutral Still.
__label__neutral If Phoebe were my maid of honor
__label__neutral Uh-hmm.
__label__neutral Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
__label__neutral Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.
__label__neutral Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours?
__label__neutral Well thats the best part. Umm,
__label__surprise Wh-why is that the best part?
__label__joy Because then I dont have to!
__label__neutral Well of
__label__non-neutral Im really not deciding!
__label__non-neutral Fine!
__label__neutral Yeah thats right.
__label__joy Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!
__label__neutral If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?
__label__neutral It's not just the drum noise.
__label__non-neutral Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye!
__label__non-neutral Oh god, my eye!"
__label__non-neutral I mean, it is so annoying.
__label__neutral Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
__label__surprise Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
__label__neutral Maybe on some level.
__label__surprise Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
__label__neutral No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you.
__label__joy Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you.
__label__joy And, a brownie!
__label__neutral Well, half a brownie.
__label__neutral Actually, its just bag.
__label__neutral Its been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin to feel faint so
__label__joy Oh man!
__label__joy This is so great!
__label__joy I actually feel like Im going on a real date!
__label__neutral Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and Im wearing underwear that goes up to aboutthere.
__label__non-neutral Hey come on now, this is a real date.
__label__neutral Uh, sonice place you got here.
__label__surprise Foosball, huh?
__label__neutral Pizza box.
__label__surprise Oh, a subscription to
__label__neutral Yeah, actually thats my roommates.
__label__neutral I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
__label__neutral Ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch yourself.
__label__non-neutral Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking?
__label__neutral Hm-mmm.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
__label__neutral Yeah, but Im pretty sure hes gay.
__label__non-neutral No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
__label__anger Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
__label__neutral Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
__label__joy Ha. Ha, ha.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
__label__disgust Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
__label__neutral Oh, I beg to differ. The
__label__neutral That was
__label__joy Oooooh.  : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
__label__surprise Well, not playing raquetball!
__label__surprise He forgot to leave his grip size!
__label__surprise He didn't get the goggles!
__label__neutral Well,sounds like you two have issues.
__label__neutral Goodbye, baby.
__label__neutral Ciao, bela.
__label__neutral Do they wait for me to do this?
__label__neutral So are you gonna tell him?
__label__neutral Why would I tell him?
__label__neutral How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
__label__non-neutral Oh...
__label__non-neutral What are you guys doing here?
__label__surprise Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
__label__neutral ...What did I ask?
__label__disgust God. I feel violated.
__label__disgust Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
__label__neutral Ross, ten o'clock.
__label__non-neutral Is it? Feels like two.
__label__neutral No,
__label__neutral What?
__label__joy There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
__label__joy Oh. Hel-lo!
__label__joy She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
__label__joy Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
__label__fear Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
__label__joy Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
__label__neutral Oh please, could she
__label__neutral He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
__label__joy Thank you, buddy.
__label__neutral Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
__label__joy You could do that!
__label__surprise Y'think?
__label__neutral OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
__label__neutral OK.
__label__joy This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
__label__neutral Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
__label__neutral Last time I do that, I promise.
__label__sadness I am so, so, so, so sorry!
__label__disgust Uh-huh.
__label__non-neutral And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
__label__non-neutral Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin me?!
__label__non-neutral Come on Monica, its our Valentines Day. Please? Please-please, please?
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral So, are we going in there?
__label__joy I am!!
__label__surprise Wow!
__label__neutral It actually is in the handbook.
__label__non-neutral I cant date you or have a hot plate in my office.
__label__non-neutral I cant believe we have to stop seeing each other.
__label__non-neutral For what its worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
__label__neutral I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we cant date. Its against the rules. Its forbidden.
__label__surprise Wow!
__label__surprise What?
__label__joy Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, its really hot.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral Well I-I-I dont care how hot it is its-its uh, its wrong.
__label__non-neutral Stop it!
__label__non-neutral No! No! Its wrong! Its-its-its naughty. Its taboo.
__label__non-neutral Shut the book!
__label__joy Lets also get a hot plate!
__label__joy Rach, youre in a great place in your life. Come on, youve got a great job! Good friends
__label__non-neutral Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
__label__neutral Oh Im not, I just like to try these on.
__label__neutral I do the same thing.
__label__joy Im just kidding. Im getting married July 25
__label__joy Im just kidding too.  Im getting married in December.
__label__neutral So when are you getting married?
__label__neutral Oh May 15
__label__joy Oooh its getting close!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral So uh, whos your photographer?
__label__neutral Jeffery.
__label__non-neutral We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
__label__surprise The best man? Wow!
__label__joy I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, whos your band?!
__label__neutral Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
__label__non-neutral Oh, youre so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
__label__joy Ooh, is that spelled with a C or a K? Oh my God! It doesnt matter; theyre both great!
__label__neutral Oh yknow what?
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__neutral Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinmans and get it half off.
__label__disgust This place is so overpriced.
__label__neutral So, does this  come in another color or
__label__neutral I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time.
__label__surprise It was unbelievable!
__label__joy We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
__label__neutral So have you called her yet?
__label__fear Let her know I like her?
__label__non-neutral What are you, insane?
__label__non-neutral It's the next day!
__label__non-neutral How needy do I want to seem?
__label__non-neutral I'm right, right?
__label__neutral Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
__label__surprise I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
__label__non-neutral Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
__label__neutral Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.
__label__neutral Her answer machine?
__label__neutral No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
__label__neutral So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
__label__disgust Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
__label__surprise Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
__label__neutral Okay, okay, what's going on?
__label__neutral Okay, they're just talking...
__label__neutral Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
__label__neutral So, um, what do you do for a living?
__label__neutral Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
__label__neutral Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
__label__sadness I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
__label__neutral Now that is funny.
__label__neutral Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?
__label__sadness 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
__label__neutral I guess.
__label__neutral Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
__label__neutral Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
__label__neutral Come on.
__label__neutral These people'll scooch down.
__label__neutral You guys'll scooch, won't you?
__label__joy Let's try scooching!
__label__neutral Come on.
__label__neutral Come on.
__label__neutral Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.
__label__neutral Carol, Kristin.
__label__neutral Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.
__label__non-neutral And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral When I was six years old.
__label__neutral Hm-mmm.
__label__neutral I wanted a big wheel.
__label__non-neutral And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.
__label__sadness It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me.
__label__sadness That was a pretty tough year.
__label__joy Thats-thats great!
__label__neutral See?
__label__joy I already feel like I know you a little better!
__label__joy Thank you.
__label__neutral Okay, come on.
__label__neutral Now we can go eat.
__label__neutral Lets go.
__label__sadness It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__anger Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
__label__surprise That's patio furniture!
__label__neutral So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
__label__neutral What about the birds?
__label__neutral I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
__label__neutral You pick one.
__label__neutral All right, how about the ladybugs?
__label__non-neutral Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
__label__non-neutral Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
__label__non-neutral Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!
__label__neutral Bijan for men?
__label__neutral Bijan for men?
__label__neutral Bijan for...   Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
__label__neutral Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
__label__neutral Ready, Annabelle?
__label__neutral You bet.  Maybe some other time?
__label__sadness Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?!
__label__joy That was amazing!
__label__neutral Phoebe and Gary are
__label__joy That was amazing.
__label__joy We are the hottest! Huh?
__label__neutral No, you're the best.
__label__neutral No, you're the best.
__label__neutral No, you're the best.
__label__neutral I
__label__neutral Hey guys!  What 'cha been doin'?
__label__neutral Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
__label__neutral How you doin'?
__label__neutral So what are you gonna do?
__label__sadness What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
__label__non-neutral Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
__label__non-neutral Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while?
__label__non-neutral Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
__label__neutral Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
__label__neutral Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
__label__neutral Why? What happened to him?
__label__neutral Nothing, hes just really believes in that.
__label__neutral It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
__label__joy Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
__label__neutral Well, okay, so whats nowgo get, go get the eggs, put em in there.
__label__neutral Okay, itll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
__label__surprise Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
__label__neutral Um-hmm, five actually.
__label__neutral Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
__label__neutral We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
__label__surprise Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
__label__neutral Hey, yknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
__label__neutral Sweety, now, shes a woman, not a gumball machine.
__label__neutral Okay, well yknow what, dont worry you guys, cause Im-Im gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
__label__neutral Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
__label__neutral Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.
__label__neutral So, umm, were kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
__label__non-neutral Whoa!! Thatokay, thats a
__label__neutral No, Im sorry.
__label__surprise Wow! You guys really dont know anything!
__label__non-neutral I know! Why dont you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
__label__neutral Sorry. So hows it going with Joey?
__label__neutral Oh just great.
__label__neutral He beeps me now with codes.
__label__neutral One is, "Bring me food."
__label__neutral Two is, "Im with a girl, bring us food."
__label__neutral Three is, "Im lost and I cant find food."
__label__non-neutral Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
__label__joy Yeah! Shes right in there!
__label__joy Oh great.   Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__surprise You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
__label__disgust Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
__label__non-neutral Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
__label__neutral I don't know, clean places?
__label__neutral Umm, yum!
__label__neutral It's Danny.
__label__fear Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
__label__non-neutral We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?
__label__surprise What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
__label__non-neutral The fake kind!
__label__neutral Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
__label__neutral We have a ladle.
__label__neutral Thanks, see you at the party.
__label__joy Okay, great!
__label__neutral Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
__label__joy You're so efficient. I love you!
__label__joy Let's go!
__label__non-neutral No-no-no! We need something old!
__label__non-neutral Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
__label__joy That'll work!
__label__neutral I don't think so.
__label__joy Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
__label__neutral Here justtake this.
__label__non-neutral That's stealing!
__label__neutral No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
__label__non-neutral Ohh.
__label__neutral Okay, one thing at a time.
__label__neutral Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
__label__joy Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
__label__joy Oh, that's great.
__label__surprise Why are- why are you so tanned?
__label__neutral Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
__label__joy Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk.
__label__non-neutral Oh God, oh.
__label__sadness Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
__label__non-neutral Monica? Monica!
__label__joy Water rules!
__label__neutral Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
__label__neutral Nope. Going to the
__label__non-neutral Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
__label__joy No, it is me!
__label__anger Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in!
__label__non-neutral Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that.
__label__joy I'm- I'm Monana!
__label__neutral Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
__label__joy Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
__label__neutral What?
__label__non-neutral They've arrested Monica.
__label__neutral Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.
__label__neutral Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
__label__neutral No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
__label__neutral Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y.
__label__neutral I just...
__label__neutral I wrote that out phonetically for you.
__label__neutral Phonetically?
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this.
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__surprise Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
__label__non-neutral Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"    I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
__label__surprise Wow. What does
__label__non-neutral No idea!
__label__non-neutral But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
__label__neutral Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
__label__neutral Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .
__label__non-neutral Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't
__label__neutral Come on! you...
__label__anger No!
__label__neutral Oh.  Oh-oh.
__label__surprise Hey!  What happened to you? Why didnt you come up?
__label__joy Done!
__label__non-neutral You just finished?
__label__neutral Well, I wanted to be thorough.
__label__non-neutral I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us!
__label__non-neutral And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
__label__neutral So umm, does it?
__label__sadness Im sorry.
__label__fear Does it?
__label__neutral Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole Does it? part just another glance.
__label__anger What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!
__label__anger Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesnt, and if you have to even
__label__neutral No, Rach, no. I dont, I dont, I dont
__label__non-neutral Are you sure?
__label__non-neutral Oh, sure! Im sure.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__neutral You got married again.
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__neutral So thats your second marriage in two years.
__label__neutral Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
__label__neutral Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client.
__label__neutral Why dont you tell me what happened.
__label__neutral Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
__label__surprise Im sorry, is this the same Rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
__label__non-neutral Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do
__label__neutral Oh, thats better then.
__label__neutral This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
__label__neutral I see. Have you considered therapy?
__label__neutral I think just the
__label__neutral There are a couple of forms to fill out.
__label__neutral Easy.
__label__neutral And well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
__label__neutral No problem.
__label__neutral And well need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
__label__surprise Ooh!
__label__surprise Theres no way to do this without her?
__label__fear Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
__label__neutral But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
__label__neutral Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
__label__neutral That's alright, I'll take it.
__label__neutral Bad things happen to me anyway.
__label__neutral This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
__label__neutral Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
__label__surprise Ah!  Huh?
__label__neutral You wanna do it right now?
__label__joy Great!
__label__neutral Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from

__label__neutral Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah! Yeah, no, were gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
__label__neutral Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars.
__label__neutral And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
__label__non-neutral You know, we dont really take advantage of living in the city.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__neutral Okay, Chandler!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
__label__joy Oh, well thank you in advance.
__label__surprise Op, but the twelfth brings a lovers spat.
__label__surprise Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
__label__neutral Hey guys!
__label__joy Hey!!
__label__surprise Oh my God! Its Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
__label__joy Oh thats right. Its your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?

__label__neutral No! Joey, youre going to be great!
__label__fear But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I dont know anything about technology!
__label__non-neutral I cant even use Chandlers computer except to find porn!
__label__non-neutral And-and thats only cause its right there when you turn it on!
__label__non-neutral I think our lovers spat will start a little early this month.
__label__neutral Ill be waiting.
__label__non-neutral Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
__label__surprise Oh my God! It sure didnt look this way when I lived here.
__label__surprise I know!
__label__non-neutral Now look, theres only one problem though.
__label__neutral Theres only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joeys.
__label__sadness Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.
__label__non-neutral Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no ones fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
__label__neutral Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
__label__joy Okay!

__label__sadness I have.
__label__neutral This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
__label__neutral Sorry, that was wax.
__label__sadness Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.

__label__non-neutral During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__sadness Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.
__label__neutral But I'll still always come back, like this.
__label__neutral And sometimes I may be away longer, like this.
__label__neutral But I'll still always come back, like this.
__label__non-neutral And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
__label__joy He is so amazing.
__label__joy Oh, I know. Look at him.
__label__neutral Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.

__label__neutral Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.

__label__joy Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
__label__non-neutral Oh no, I cant go. Im practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.

__label__anger No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
__label__neutral How can I help you?
__label__non-neutral Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section?
__label__non-neutral See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
__label__neutral We are aware of the problem you are referring to.
__label__neutral But as far as increasing security, Im afraid the library is very understaffed.
__label__non-neutral I, I cant help you.
__label__non-neutral Well, fine.
__label__anger Fine!
__label__anger If-if Im the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, Ill go up there and defend it myself!
__label__anger And dont you follow me!
__label__neutral Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
__label__surprise Oh my God! Phoebe look, its Ross and that girl.
__label__surprise No! No! Look at that!  Its a line of ants! Theyre working as a team!
__label__non-neutral Phoebe!
__label__neutral Right, oh yeah.
__label__surprise Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her.
__label__non-neutral Uff, I hope he lets her down easy.
__label__neutral Lets go.
__label__non-neutral Come on Phoebe, look at that!
__label__neutral They are not breaking up, look at them.
__label__neutral Okay thats, you know what that is?
__label__non-neutral That is a, that is a second date, thats what that is!
__label__non-neutral Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
__label__neutral Oh no! That really is nothing, she is
__label__anger Ohh!  Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, hes gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
__label__neutral You know where I work!
__label__neutral I do?
__label__neutral The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
__label__neutral You still work at the multiplex?
__label__joy Oh, like Id give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
__label__neutral Thanks, Im set. Do you still live with your parents?
__label__neutral Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
__label__joy Nice car!
__label__neutral Yeah, its not mine.
__label__joy I love your car.

__label__neutral All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
__label__neutral All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__fear No-no-no-no!
__label__joy YES!!
__label__neutral Uh fellas,
__label__neutral Okay, so he's out of here.
__label__neutral Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
__label__neutral I know it doesn't make much sense
__label__neutral Much
__label__anger Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
__label__non-neutral So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
__label__non-neutral I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!
__label__non-neutral So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
__label__non-neutral No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here.

__label__joy Check out the ring.
__label__joy Nice! One and a half carat easy.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__joy Hey-hey Pheebs!
__label__surprise What?
__label__joy Chandlers gonna ask Monica to marry him!
__label__neutral Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
__label__surprise You told her before you told us?
__label__fear Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right?  Guys? Guys?
__label__neutral Let's see.
__label__neutral Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
__label__neutral What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
__label__neutral Nah... not-not special enough.
__label__neutral Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
__label__neutral Waaay too special.

__label__joy The silk? Feels really good!
__label__non-neutral Ah yeah, sorry about that.
__label__neutral Its okay. Come, come on in.
__label__joy Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monicas place was nice, but her fiancée sure stares a lot.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__surprise Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
__label__neutral Uh-huh. Yeah, I-I have a knack for impressions.
__label__joy Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
__label__disgust YeahNo!!
__label__joy Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out!  Guess which job I got.
__label__neutral I dont know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
__label__neutral But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
__label__neutral Well, you-you know what I meant.
__label__non-neutral No, you messed it up. Youre stupid.
__label__neutral So what job did you get Joe?
__label__neutral Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
__label__neutral Well, how can you be a tour guide, dont you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
__label__non-neutral I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
__label__neutral Y'know if we ever go to war and youre captured, youre in for a
__label__non-neutral It just keeps getting worse and worse!
__label__neutral Y'know?
__label__neutral I mean its bad enough that Im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, I think she knows.
__label__neutral Because every time were in the room together theres this weird like energy between us.
__label__neutral And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too.
__label__non-neutral And now I have seen her naked.
__label__neutral I mean at least when Ive seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something.
__label__neutral But there are no boles, shes smooth!
__label__neutral Smooth!
__label__surprise Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
__label__surprise Yeah! Oh my God!
__label__surprise So, you and Angela, huh?
__label__joy Yep. Pretty much.
__label__surprise Oh, that's what she meant!
__label__neutral You know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE!
__label__neutral You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion!
__label__neutral Yeah, most of it it's a place
__label__neutral Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
__label__neutral Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison    Avenue.
__label__neutral You know what?
__label__non-neutral She loves architecture, you know what you should do?
__label__joy You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there    there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
__label__surprise Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
__label__neutral But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food...
__label__surprise Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__neutral You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
__label__neutral Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities    wing.
__label__neutral Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
__label__surprise Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make    the right
__label__non-neutral Hey!

__label__neutral Because every time I look at that cover Im like
__label__non-neutral It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
__label__non-neutral Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section

__label__surprise !
__label__surprise What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
__label__non-neutral I cant believe mom and dad are selling the house!

__label__joy (Singing, to the tune of
__label__neutral That's okay.
__label__non-neutral But you haven't even heard the chorus!
__label__non-neutral Well, shell understand right? Its not like I did it on purpose.
__label__neutral Dad, that wont matter to her.
__label__non-neutral Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all hers is-is, is growing new stuff!
__label__non-neutral See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
__label__surprise Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
__label__non-neutral Well, can you blame her?
__label__joy Well I dont know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could

__label__joy Yknow Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
__label__surprise You could?
__label__joy Yeah! Ive been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
__label__surprise Your own boat?
__label__surprise What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
__label__joy Hes coming here for Thanksgiving!
__label__non-neutral Count in our heads as-as good
__label__neutral I guess I'm done.
__label__non-neutral Fun's over!

__label__joy Uh-huh!
__label__neutral I think I'm gonna take-off.
__label__joy Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun!  Ohhh!
__label__neutral Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it
__label__neutral Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
__label__neutral Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
__label__neutral Do you want a date Saturday?
__label__neutral Yes please.
__label__neutral Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
__label__surprise He's a he?

__label__non-neutral I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley.
__label__disgust I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now...
__label__disgust Okay, goodbye...
__label__sadness Well, it's official there are no good movies.
__label__neutral Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
__label__neutral Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back.
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey, man. What's up?
__label__neutral Maybe you can tell me.
__label__non-neutral My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today.
__label__non-neutral The first good thing she gets me in weeks.
__label__anger How could you not give me the message?
__label__non-neutral !
__label__non-neutral Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
__label__non-neutral Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!
__label__neutral See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
__label__neutral Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
__label__surprise Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
__label__non-neutral Theres this kid in my class who said hes in love with me.
__label__surprise Whoa!
__label__surprise Whoa what?
__label__neutral Ross has a boyfriend.
__label__joy I do-I do
__label__surprise Really?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral I dont know.
__label__non-neutral I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid.
__label__non-neutral What-what-what-what is it?!
__label__non-neutral Am I giving out some kind ofsexy professor vibe?
__label__neutral Not right now.
__label__non-neutral It-itThe point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
__label__sadness Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid!
__label__non-neutral I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard!
__label__neutral Yknow youI couldnt concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me.
__label__non-neutral I mean come on, you remember whats its like to be 19 and in love.
__label__joy Oh yes! Thank you very much!  Oh thats-thats actually how the French drink it.
__label__joy A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man!  Yes!
__label__joy Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
__label__joy That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
__label__neutral Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
__label__neutral Pick a number! That is your
__label__joy 8. 8!
__label__joy Thank you!
__label__joy If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
__label__neutral Yeah, I understand.
__label__neutral Take as much time as you want.
__label__neutral Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it.
__label__non-neutral Ill be here.
__label__sadness Not smoking.
__label__surprise Were really gonna do this, huh?
__label__neutral Looks like it.
__label__neutral Yknow, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at

__label__neutral Okay.
__label__joy Susan! Hi!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Thank you so much for coming.
__label__joy Oh, I wouldnt miss it for the world.
__label__neutral Im-Im Ross by the way.
__label__joy Hello Ross.  I love what youve done with this space.
__label__joy Thank you so much.
__label__surprise How hot is this?!
__label__neutral Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm
__label__neutral G.I. Joe
__label__joy Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
__label__sadness It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
__label__disgust That, that's what's stupid.
__label__neutral I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers.
__label__neutral And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
__label__non-neutral Down at the docks again?
__label__neutral Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
__label__anger Im not gonna tell you! Youre the bad man who broke Sarahs leg.
__label__non-neutral Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
__label__anger Youre a big scrud.
__label__neutral Whats a scrud?
__label__anger Why dont you look in the mirror, scrud.
__label__non-neutral I dont have too. I can just look at you.
__label__non-neutral All right girls, and man. Lets see your final tallies.  Ohhhh, Debbie,  321 boxes of cookies,  Very nice.
__label__non-neutral Not nice enough.
__label__neutral Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
__label__neutral So, howd the lasagne go over?
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Good.
__label__neutral So you owe me three pretty things.
__label__neutral Yeah, Ive been thinking a lot about you too.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__sadness Its hard this whole platonic thing.
__label__surprise Its a word!
__label__neutral Yeah, I do think its better this way.  Yeah, were being smart.   Yes, Im sure.
__label__neutral You really sure?
__label__neutral Ill call you back.
__label__surprise So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
__label__neutral Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
__label__neutral Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.
__label__neutral But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary.
__label__neutral I am
__label__neutral I think you're better than you think you are.
__label__surprise Really? Okay, so
__label__neutral Know when to stop.
__label__neutral Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
__label__neutral Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen.  Don't do the dance.
__label__joy Right!
__label__anger Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
__label__surprise Hey!-Hey! Whats going on?

__label__anger No, she touched mine first!
__label__anger Thats my job!
__label__surprise Are you being British?!
__label__neutral No. Not anymore.
__label__surprise Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
__label__neutral Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
__label__non-neutral Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
__label__non-neutral Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
__label__neutral Where is this party?
__label__neutral Here in Chelsea.
__label__non-neutral Who's party is it?
__label__neutral A woman's
__label__anger What woman?!
__label__neutral Chelsea.
__label__neutral Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here.
__label__disgust Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet.
__label__disgust Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle.
__label__non-neutral So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
__label__non-neutral Can I be that guy?
__label__joy Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
__label__non-neutral Yknow uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
__label__non-neutral Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
__label__surprise Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I dont feel that way about you.
__label__non-neutral Oh no-no-no, thats notNo-no-no!
__label__non-neutral Did you just flick me?
__label__non-neutral OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]
__label__anger Oh!  All right.  Now, let's not do this!
__label__non-neutral Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!
__label__anger OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
__label__non-neutral Ow! Ow! Ow!
__label__non-neutral I know!  I know!  I know!
__label__neutral Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
__label__anger Fine!
__label__anger Fine!
__label__neutral There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
__label__neutral Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on.
__label__neutral I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__sadness Hi, listen, Im sorry about before.
__label__neutral I dont need to have a game room.

__label__sadness Stop it Chandler.  Im sorry too.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__non-neutral Yeah! Oh yes!
__label__neutral Ohh.
__label__joy Listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
__label__joy Thats a great idea! We can
__label__joy Totally!
__label__neutral We dont have to come up with this now.
__label__joy Oh good.
__label__neutral Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
__label__joy Thats great. Good for you guys.
__label__anger I am not high maintenance!
__label__anger I am not a pushover!
__label__non-neutral Who said you were?
__label__anger You did!
__label__neutral Oh, Im flaky. Ill say anything.
__label__non-neutral Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
__label__neutral That does not sound stupid to me.
__label__neutral You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?
__label__sadness I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.
__label__neutral Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
__label__non-neutral What uh-oh?
__label__non-neutral Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done.

__label__non-neutral And I just want a million dollars!
__label__surprise Rachel?!
__label__neutral Yeah.

__label__neutral But look, all these rooms are fine okay?
__label__non-neutral Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
__label__neutral Okay,
__label__anger Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
__label__disgust Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
__label__non-neutral Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
__label__anger Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
__label__anger Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
__label__anger I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
__label__non-neutral Do not speak ill of the dead.
__label__anger We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
__label__non-neutral I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
__label__anger What did you say?
__label__fear I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
__label__neutral Yknow, maybe its best that we never got to do it again.
__label__neutral Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Yknow, technically we still
__label__neutral Im gonna go to the bathroom, maybe Ill see you there in a bit?
__label__neutral Kay!
__label__neutral Can I ask you something?
__label__neutral Uhh, no.
__label__neutral Felicity and I, were watching
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, yknow, you think Ill ever get there?
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__neutral Thanks man.
__label__neutral Okay man.
__label__neutral But what about how much taller he is than me?
__label__neutral I mean, theres no way I can make myself taller now, yknow?
__label__non-neutral And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
__label__surprise Hey, Monica, wow youve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
__label__non-neutral I know!
__label__neutral Had the beef-tips, huh?
__label__neutral Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.

__label__neutral Alright, somebody.
__label__neutral OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
__label__surprise Whoooaa!
__label__neutral That's my sister.
__label__neutral OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.

__label__neutral Pheebs, what about you?
__label__neutral Oh... Milwaukee.
__label__neutral Um... Ross?

__label__neutral Well theres yore. And uh, yknow, yesteryear.
__label__neutral Yeah no, Im telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff.
__label__neutral Ross, yknow if you ever decide you need to redecorateAnd I think that you should.
__label__neutral You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
__label__neutral Oh honey he doesnt need my help.
__label__non-neutral Oh, come on! I think hes ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__surprise Hey, yknow what?
__label__neutral Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, heres-heres 60 bucks, why dont you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
__label__non-neutral Yknow what? I dont, I dont think Phoebe really wants to come.
__label__joy No! I do want to!
__label__neutral Oh, she does want to.
__label__neutral She does want to.
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__surprise Wow, you have really pretty feet.
__label__non-neutral These old things.

__label__neutral You mean theOkay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get yknow, real  nice and tight.
__label__surprise So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
__label__neutral Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.

__label__neutral Oh, okay.
__label__fear Ive kinda of had this ah, this crush on you.
__label__non-neutral But since you were with Ross, I-I didnt do anything about it.
__label__fear But, now that youre not, Id really like to ask you out sometime.
__label__fear So-so thats-thats what Im doing, now.
__label__surprise Wow! Umm....

__label__joy Im-Im-Im hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months.
__label__joy You should know, that were doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, youve been there!
__label__joy Umm, yknow they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on.
__label__joy Okay, and-and I promise that Ill keep you safe and warm until youre ready to have them take you home, so Oh!
__label__neutral And also, umm next time you see me, Im screaming, dont worry, thats whats supposed to happen.
__label__neutral Ready?
__label__non-neutral Uh-huh.  Good luck.
__label__joy We're baack!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__surprise What are you guys doing together?
__label__neutral Joey and Janice's
__label__surprise Really.
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah.
__label__joy We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman.
__label__neutral You have got competition buddy.
__label__neutral I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so.
__label__neutral I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
__label__neutral You still can't stand her can you?
__label__sadness I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
__label__neutral Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
__label__non-neutral But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she.
__label__neutral It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
__label__surprise You told him to play the boxer gay!!
__label__non-neutral Well, I-I mightve said supergay.
__label__non-neutral You totally screwed him over.
__label__anger Joey, youre this guys teacher. I mean how could you do this?
__label__neutral Because, Monica, the guys so good, and I really, really want this part.
__label__neutral Well, if you really, really want it, then its okay.
__label__neutral Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
__label__non-neutral Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so
__label__neutral I'm not your brother.
__label__anger What about my children Drake?! Huh!?  No!! No!! No! God!
__label__neutral Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.
__label__anger Are you kidding me?!
__label__non-neutral It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!
__label__non-neutral I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!
__label__neutral Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
__label__neutral Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
__label__neutral Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
__label__neutral Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
__label__neutral Is there something wrong?
__label__neutral All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay?
__label__neutral You're hot.
__label__neutral I'm lovable.
__label__neutral Clearly there's a vibe going on between us.
__label__neutral But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
__label__neutral Joey...
__label__non-neutral Oh no its not, no its not. Its a first date. Im
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__joy Ho-oh, hes gonna get some!
__label__neutral Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment.
__label__neutral Yknow so umm, hes closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister.
__label__neutral Well, Im off to bed!
__label__joy You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
__label__joy Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
__label__joy No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
__label__fear Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__non-neutral Umm, look I like you.
__label__non-neutral I-I really do, I like you a lot.
__label__non-neutral Okay?
__label__non-neutral But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very
__label__surprise Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
__label__surprise Oh, Joey! Sorry!
__label__joy They made you head of the department!
__label__non-neutral No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!  Why didnt I get head of the department?
__label__neutral Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
__label__neutral Uh, Pauls Café. They got great food and its really romantic.
__label__joy Ooh, great! Thanks!
__label__neutral Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the
__label__neutral You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, Ill tell ya
__label__sadness Ooh, I miss dating.
__label__neutral Gettin all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant.
__label__joy Im not gonna be able to do that for so long, and its so much fun!
__label__neutral I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
__label__neutral Hey, yknow what?
__label__neutral Huh?
__label__neutral Why dont I take you out?
__label__surprise What?! Joey, you dont want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
__label__joy Yes I do!
__label__joy And were gonna go out, were gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out
__label__joy Okay! Ill go with ya! Ill go! Ill go with ya.
__label__neutral Ill be fun.
__label__neutral All right?
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking
__label__joy Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good,    and... and my co-star's good
__label__joy God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
__label__non-neutral Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with    me?
__label__non-neutral Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
__label__neutral Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
__label__anger Oh screw her, that part is mine!
__label__neutral Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
__label__surprise Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you    here.
__label__surprise I can't believe you married him.
__label__non-neutral But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a
__label__sadness So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
__label__non-neutral It's over! You
__label__surprise How can I?
__label__sadness Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?
__label__sadness How can I accept that...
__label__sadness I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.
__label__joy Kiss me.
__label__surprise What?
__label__joy Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
__label__neutral The bigger half.
__label__joy I'd like to propose a toast.
__label__joy Little toast here, ding ding.
__label__joy I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
__label__non-neutral Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
__label__joy So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
__label__joy That's so sweet.
__label__joy And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
__label__joy And a crappy New Year.
__label__joy Here, here!
__label__anger Now, hold on!
__label__anger Hold on!
__label__anger Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that Im gonna be at that airport and I hope that shell be there too!
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah, I said Rachels name, but it didnt mean anything, Okay?
__label__non-neutral Shes-shes just a friend and thats all!
__label__non-neutral Thats all!
__label__non-neutral Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I cant imagine spending my life with anyone else.
__label__sadness Please, promise me that youll tell her that.
__label__non-neutral All right, Ill tell her.  Come on bugger face!
__label__neutral Call me.
__label__anger You spend half your life in the bathroom, why dont you ever go out the bloody window!
__label__surprise What happened?!!
__label__surprise Well, I dont know!!
__label__neutral We fell asleep! That is all.
__label__neutral Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, Id better go.
__label__neutral I think that would be best.
__label__neutral Yeah. All right, Ill talk to you later.
__label__non-neutral Okay. But not about this!
__label__non-neutral No! Never! Never!  Bye.
__label__non-neutral No touch! No touch!
__label__sadness Umm ma'am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral It's a funny story, actually.
__label__neutral I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really  know what I was saying.
__label__surprise You fell asleep?
__label__fear But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain't that funny?
__label__surprise Irony?
__label__neutral Not a fan, alright .
__label__neutral See, here's  the thing.
__label__neutral I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go.
__label__joy See, me, I  love Tulsa!
__label__joy Tulsa is heaven!
__label__fear Tulsa is Italy—Please don't make me go  there!
__label__non-neutral Chandler, I…
__label__fear No no no!
__label__neutral Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?
__label__non-neutral Wh-why  would I when your name is Elaine?
__label__non-neutral Oh what a great picture of your son,  strapping!
__label__non-neutral That's a picture of your daughter, isn't it,  well she's lovely.
__label__non-neutral I like a girl with a strong jaw.
__label__neutral I'll call you from Tulsa.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral How are you?
__label__neutral I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
__label__neutral Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
__label__surprise That I was not expecting.
__label__neutral I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
__label__neutral Oh. Thanks.
__label__joy No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing
__label__neutral Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
__label__surprise I just can't believe you're in here.
__label__sadness I mean, what am I gonna do without you?
__label__non-neutral Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?
__label__non-neutral Who's gonna take me to the
__label__disgust Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
__label__neutral What do you mean?
__label__neutral Smell familiar?
__label__fear Oh no.
__label__sadness Oh, I am so sorry.
__label__sadness No me, I am so sorry...
__label__surprise Oh my.
__label__fear Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot.
__label__fear Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
__label__neutral Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
__label__neutral Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
__label__neutral My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
__label__neutral No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
__label__neutral Tho?
__label__non-neutral Ohhh.
__label__neutral That's good, have a seat.
__label__neutral Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle.
__label__neutral You're just gonna have to be brave, ok?
__label__neutral Can you do that for me?
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__neutral Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?
__label__fear Yes!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.
__label__anger Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!
__label__anger Oh, Ross!
__label__anger Let go of my hand!
__label__joy Youre gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!
__label__joy Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
__label__neutral Welllets just say
__label__joy Oo, where are the seats?
__label__neutral Uh, middle balcony.
__label__anger Youre a mean old woman.
__label__non-neutral No! Wait no! Shut upI mean dont cry! Let me get my checkbook!
__label__non-neutral Look honey, you dont have to do this, okay?
__label__joy Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me.
__label__joy Youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity!
__label__joy Thats the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
__label__anger That means nothing to me.  Come on!
__label__non-neutral Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
__label__neutral : Hey.
__label__neutral : What are you doing?
__label__non-neutral Ummm. Oh! Im sorry.  Its a little old but
__label__anger : No! Youre clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
__label__sadness Im sorry. I didntI dont come in here a lot.
__label__anger : Oh yeah, of course you dont!
__label__neutral No.
__label__disgust : Cause youre a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of
__label__non-neutral I didnt I never said that.
__label__anger : You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh?
__label__anger Well, why dont think of someone else for a change?
__label__sadness Okay, Im sorry.
__label__non-neutral Hello!
__label__neutral What's this?
__label__neutral Oh right its that girl's phone number.
__label__non-neutral Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me.
__label__surprise It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa!
__label__joy Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__surprise I dont know how any of these got opened?!
__label__surprise You opened them all?
__label__non-neutral I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!
__label__joy Oh hey! You got my parents gift!
__label__neutral Yeah. What is that?
__label__non-neutral Well, I dont know. I think it does something to salami.
__label__non-neutral Hey! Howd it go?
__label__neutral Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
__label__non-neutral Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
__label__joy I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you.
__label__surprise Oh wow, you didnt even try to unhook my bra!
__label__neutral So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
__label__non-neutral No, I will. Im just not up for it tonight.
__label__non-neutral Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know youre not gonna be alone in this.
__label__surprise Im not?
__label__fear Listen I uh  Its a scary world out there especially if youre a single mom.
__label__non-neutral Yknow, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond.
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__joy So,  Rachel Green will you marry me?
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__anger If I cant have it you cant have it!
__label__disgust I cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical.
__label__neutral Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget.
__label__neutral There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and
__label__neutral Paris?
__label__neutral We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
__label__neutral Keep talking.
__label__joy Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because its romantic, but because I can!
__label__joy I love you!
__label__joy Yes!
__label__joy I win again!
__label__joy Ha-ha!
__label__joy Thats like 500 bucks you owe me!
__label__joy Whoo-ho-hoo!
__label__joy $500 that is a loooot of electricity!
__label__joy Whoo-ho-ho!
__label__neutral I gotta buy some food.
__label__non-neutral Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
__label__surprise You serious?
__label__non-neutral Oh yes!
__label__joy Okay, get ready to owe me!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay, here we go. Ready?
__label__non-neutral No! No! No! Noone can beat me.
__label__non-neutral See? Now, thats why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
__label__surprise Who is that?!
__label__non-neutral Dont worry, Im brave!
__label__fear I am brave!
__label__fear II am brave!
__label__fear No-no-no-no!!
__label__neutral Can you tell me who is there please?
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Hi. Do you know what time it is?
__label__joy Its candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
__label__joy Oh please!  Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
__label__neutral 4:00 A.M.
__label__neutral So, can I get some candy?
__label__neutral I am sorry, but some of us have to
__label__sadness Umm, listen I am sorry, but Ill put some out first thing in the morning.
__label__neutral Well okay, Ill swing by later. Do you live in this building?
__label__neutral Um-hmm.
__label__surprise Mm! Seems like I wouldve remembered you!
__label__neutral Mm! Night Gar!
__label__non-neutral Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guys hammered!
__label__neutral Im sorry Joey, as long as hes here and hes conscious were still shooting.
__label__neutral You wouldnt happen to have a very big fork?
__label__neutral So I uh, I just talked to the director. Thats it, were done for the day.
__label__surprise Well have we finished the scene?
__label__joy Yeah! Youyou were wonderful.
__label__neutral As were you.
__label__neutral So I got your car, its right outside.
__label__surprise Why? Are we done for the day?
__label__neutral Thats what you told me.
__label__non-neutral Oh, thank you. Youre welcome.
__label__fear No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on!  Here we go.
__label__non-neutral Is that my ass?
__label__neutral What about these? These look the same?
__label__joy Definitely!
__label__neutral Not as each other!
__label__neutral Oh, then no.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__non-neutral Hi!
__label__neutral You ready?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
__label__joy Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
__label__neutral Let me see the earrings.
__label__neutral Oh, honey, the earrings
__label__joy They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
__label__joy My boyfriend really does have good taste!
__label__neutral Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
__label__neutral Hm-mmm.
__label__neutral I know that theres no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Look at this!
__label__neutral Okay, but there
__label__anger I dont care! The wires have come loose in your head!
__label__neutral I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
__label__non-neutral And did you?!
__label__neutral No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
__label__neutral But it didnt. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral Hello darling.
__label__neutral Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
__label__neutral Okay, is everybody clear? Were gonna pick it upand move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? Were gonna
__label__neutral Ross, I really dont think
__label__joy Lift!! And slide!
__label__neutral Okay, here we go.
__label__joy All right everyone, lift!  And slide!!
__label__neutral All right Carl, were next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
__label__neutral Another
__label__neutral Thats right! And what are you not gonna do?
__label__neutral Well, Im not gonna talk because
__label__sadness I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but
__label__non-neutral Ohmy Gawd, I-I understand.
__label__sadness I-I am so sorry, Ill go.
__label__sadness Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.
__label__neutral Chandler,  you call me when this goes in the pooper.
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__joy I found my identical hand twin!
__label__neutral Ohh, you are
__label__neutral No!
__label__surprise But she just came up here!
__label__neutral That was Joey!
__label__neutral I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
__label__neutral Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
__label__anger Would you stop that!
__label__neutral Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard?
__label__neutral She didn't feel anything for him.
__label__non-neutral She loves you!
__label__surprise Really?
__label__non-neutral Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Good.  I should really start wearing hats!
__label__neutral I mean, why should I let them meet him?
__label__disgust I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him.
__label__non-neutral I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
__label__neutral Listen.
__label__neutral As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.
__label__neutral I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
__label__sadness I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
__label__neutral Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
__label__non-neutral No-no-no-no.  Hey!
__label__neutral Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
__label__neutral Hey sweetie.
__label__neutral Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
__label__neutral I cant tell you. Its a secret.
__label__non-neutral Secret? Married people arent supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
__label__neutral Awww.  But still no.
__label__neutral No Im serious, we should tell each other
__label__neutral Really? Okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at
__label__fear Oh no-no, I cant do that.
__label__neutral If you tell me, Ill tell you what Phoebe said.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral So, Ross and I are going to
__label__disgust Oh my God. He threw up?
__label__neutral No, he visited a little town south of throw up.  So what was Phoebes secret?
__label__neutral Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebes old massage place is getting fired.
__label__non-neutral Thats it?! I gave up my
__label__joy Thats right! You lose sucker!!  Please still marry me.
__label__joy Ahhh!  Ooh, nice!
__label__non-neutral My God!
__label__non-neutral Oh hey! How was your audition?
__label__neutral Im sorry, do I know you?
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__non-neutral Nothing, Im just practicing blowing you off because Im gonna be a big movie star!
__label__non-neutral Oh! You got it?!
__label__joy Well no, not yet. But the audition went really good.
__label__neutral What was it for?
__label__neutral Oh, its this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century.
__label__joy Its really classy!
__label__joy Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next next Martin Scorcese.
__label__neutral The next next?
__label__neutral Yeah, theres this guy from Chicago whos supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right?
__label__neutral But then this guys right after him.
__label__joy Hello!
__label__joy They loved me!
__label__joy Oh my God!
__label__surprise Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it!  Oh.  Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
__label__neutral Whats the matter?
__label__surprise They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
__label__surprise Wow!
__label__non-neutral I know! My grandmothers gonna see this!
__label__joy Grandmas gonna have to get in line.
__label__non-neutral Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
__label__surprise What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
__label__neutral Who?
__label__neutral Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyones name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames.
__label__neutral Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
__label__neutral Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
__label__neutral Umm, no. No.
__label__surprise Yes you did! What was it?
__label__neutral Umm, its Cutie McPretty.
__label__joy Ohh thats so sweet!
__label__joy Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-Im having a great time!
__label__surprise Yknow how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but its not.
__label__non-neutral I mean its not at all.
__label__joy Dr. Geller!
__label__joy Burt!
__label__neutral Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
__label__neutral Okay, shoot.
__label__neutral Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
__label__non-neutral I didn't get it?
__label__non-neutral No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
__label__neutral Okay, what else?
__label__neutral Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
__label__sadness Oh.
__label__neutral Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral How's the maniac?
__label__joy Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
__label__surprise Phoebe, what are you doing?
__label__non-neutral Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
__label__disgust Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
__label__joy Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
__label__surprise You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?

__label__non-neutral Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
__label__anger Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.

__label__non-neutral This is the first time in my life Im doing something that Im actually good at.
__label__neutral I mean.
__label__non-neutral if you dont get that...
__label__non-neutral No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time.
__label__anger And Im happy for ya, but Im tired of having a relationship with your answering machine!
__label__sadness Okay, I dont know what to do anymore.

__label__surprise Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
__label__neutral Oh, which museum?
__label__neutral No, answer his.
__label__joy Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars.
__label__joy She was totally at my mercy.
__label__non-neutral Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
__label__neutral No, Im getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie.
__label__non-neutral She seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
__label__non-neutral How can she be great if shes from Poughkeepsie?  That joke wouldve killed in Albany.
__label__joy Done! I did it! Heh, whos stupid now?
__label__non-neutral No, there is no way! It can
__label__neutral Why is your family

__label__surprise Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
__label__neutral So do you think that these picturesAre, are they trying to tell a story?
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, sure.
__label__neutral I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, shes crying out, Where are they, where are they?
__label__neutral Well, shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
__label__non-neutral Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral You see, now, I would date this girl.
__label__neutral Shes cute, shes outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire.
__label__neutral I mean, thats got to come in handy
__label__neutral Okay, Ive got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
__label__neutral I dont know.
__label__neutral Me neither.
__label__neutral Rachel.

__label__surprise Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
__label__neutral Also an island.
__label__neutral Hey, what time is it?
__label__neutral 2:17.
__label__surprise Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
__label__surprise Are you serious?!
__label__neutral Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
__label__surprise Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
__label__non-neutral Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
__label__neutral Hey, you guys
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Who is it?
__label__joy Its Phoebe! Phoebe!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__surprise Oh God. So-so youre making porn movies.
__label__non-neutral No Im not.
__label__non-neutral Youre making one right now!
__label__neutral And-
__label__neutral Yeah, can I help you with something?
__label__non-neutral Look, Im talking right now! Youreyou mean her.
__label__neutral Yknow, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.
__label__disgust No!!
__label__anger No way!
__label__disgust No!
__label__anger And stop using my name!
__label__disgust And shame on you!
__label__disgust And shame on all of you!
__label__disgust Youre disgusting!
__label__disgust Especially you  with that!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hi Pheebs!
__label__neutral Are you moving out?
__label__neutral No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's.
__label__neutral Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
__label__neutral Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
__label__fear Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,
__label__non-neutral Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
__label__neutral Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me.
__label__neutral One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
__label__surprise Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
__label__non-neutral Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
__label__surprise All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
__label__neutral Which proves that I never lie.
__label__neutral I guess you don't.
__label__non-neutral Paolo made a pass at me.
__label__fear Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
__label__neutral Im not freaking out.
__label__neutral Why would I be freaking out?
__label__neutral A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
__label__non-neutral Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!
__label__neutral I mean, whats the harm in that?
__label__non-neutral Right here!
__label__non-neutral Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel
__label__non-neutral Phoebe and Rachel!
__label__non-neutral So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
__label__non-neutral It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Really?
__label__neutral Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that Im just not ready
__label__neutral I know! I know.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Im gonna go tell Joey that  that youre back. I was really worried about you.
__label__neutral Hey, did she buy it?
__label__neutral Totally.
__label__neutral So did Heldi show you the place?
__label__neutral Yeah, its beautiful.
__label__joy I cant believe youre gonna ask Monica to marry you!
__label__neutral I know.
__label__anger No Phoebe!
__label__anger You cannot get the phone that way; thats not fair!
__label__neutral Okay look, I have an idea.
__label__neutral Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.
__label__neutral And then whoever does gets the phone.
__label__neutral Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
__label__non-neutral I dont think so.
__label__anger Fine all right, but Id bet youd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
__label__neutral All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
__label__sadness Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
__label__non-neutral Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
__label__sadness Did I use that already today? Im sorry.
__label__neutral Yes okay.
__label__non-neutral Well now see this isnt telling us anything.
__label__neutral Joe.
__label__neutral Carlos.
__label__neutral Peter.
__label__surprise Ooh!
__label__surprise Peter Luger!
__label__non-neutral T hats a steak house!
__label__neutral Okay, a meat eater. Fine, thats one for you.
__label__joy Oh, I win! Hes got
__label__neutral So you dont know thats
__label__surprise His new girlfriend!
__label__surprise I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
__label__non-neutral I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.
__label__non-neutral Shes saving the rest for her divorce.
__label__neutral And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to
__label__neutral Well what happened at dinner?
__label__non-neutral My parents spent the money for our wedding!
__label__surprise My God! What did you order?!
__label__sadness Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
__label__neutral Honey, its gonna be okay.
__label__sadness No! No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
__label__neutral No, yknow what?
__label__neutral Its gonna be okay.
__label__neutral I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast.
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__neutral And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
__label__neutral Dr. Geller, theres a seat over here.
__label__neutral Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Im having my lunch at this table, here in the middle.
__label__neutral Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hell sit with me.
__label__neutral I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
__label__neutral Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.
__label__sadness Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow what I see, I see-I see division.
__label__non-neutral Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!"
__label__neutral Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.
__label__joy Im Ross!
__label__joy Im divorced, and I have a kid!
__label__joy Im Joey! Im an actor! I dont know squat about dinosaurs!
__label__non-neutral Im Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
__label__joy All right, there you go!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
__label__neutral Im Andrew, and I didnt pay for this pear.
__label__non-neutral Okay, good-good for you.
__label__neutral Im Rhonda,  and these arent real!
__label__surprise Wow, Rhonda.
__label__neutral Im Scott.
__label__neutral Yeah, okay, Scott!
__label__fear And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
__label__neutral So thanks for the warm welcome.
__label__joy Its good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play.
__label__neutral I hope you do too.
__label__joy Now, lets go out there and get em!
__label__surprise Huh?
__label__neutral And remember, there is no I in team.
__label__joy Yes, but theres two in martini, soo everybody
__label__non-neutral You! Chuckles! Whats your name?
__label__non-neutral Oh its Bing, sir. Im sorry , I was just ah...
__label__neutral No-no, I heard what you said, funny.
__label__joy I like funny.
__label__joy This team is about hard work, but its also about having fun.
__label__joy Good to have you aboard Bing!
__label__neutral Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
__label__neutral So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
__label__neutral They're gonna call her Chandler.
__label__neutral That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
__label__neutral Works on you.
__label__joy Oh, that is so sweet.
__label__joy No, no, ok, you hang up.
__label__joy Ok, ok, one, two, three.
__label__joy Well you didn't hang up either.
__label__joy She didn't hang up either...
__label__joy Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y
__label__neutral Ross, hi, it's Rachel.
__label__neutral I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your

__label__surprise Ohhhhhhhh God.
__label__surprise Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
__label__non-neutral Ohh, ohh.
__label__surprise When, when were you... under me?
__label__non-neutral Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
__label__surprise OK, I need to lie down.
__label__joy Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
__label__joy Really? That's great!
__label__joy I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her
__label__neutral (noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks,
__label__non-neutral Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one.
__label__non-neutral Ben is way cuter than that kid.
__label__disgust I mean look at him, look at you,
__label__neutral That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
__label__neutral Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
__label__non-neutral I look more like him than you do!
__label__non-neutral Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
__label__joy That really was some of your best work.
__label__non-neutral Hm-hmm, I told you!  I cant believe that Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
__label__neutral I have to be up in seven minutes.
__label__neutral Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Do you wanna?
__label__joy Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and Ill get the furniture polish!
__label__neutral Oh okay. But yknow what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
__label__surprise Boyfriend?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Im Joey.
__label__neutral Kristen.
__label__joy Oh wow, what a beautiful name!  What is it again?
__label__neutral Kristen.
__label__neutral Got it!  So
__label__neutral So uh, do you live around here?
__label__neutral Yeah!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Right down there.
__label__neutral Hey listen; let me give you a little tip.
__label__non-neutral Do not take a nap on this stoop  or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
__label__neutral Ill remember that.
__label__neutral Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
__label__neutral Oh I, I have plans tonight.
__label__sadness Oh.
__label__neutral But how about tomorrow?
__label__joy Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go?
__label__neutral You look strong, why dont I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
__label__neutral Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, Ill grab this one.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Listen, um...
__label__sadness I'm sorry.
__label__neutral : Yeah, um...  You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin'
__label__non-neutral That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
__label__neutral Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
__label__neutral If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
__label__non-neutral Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
__label__sadness You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
__label__neutral By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
__label__non-neutral Oh, hello liar.
__label__sadness Look, I-Im really sorry I let go of the bike.
__label__anger I couldve been killed I hope you know!
__label__sadness I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were
__label__non-neutral Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
__label__neutral Phoebe.
__label__anger What?!  What the hell?!
__label__anger All right, yknow what?
__label__anger If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then Im sorry, Im just gonna have to take it back.
__label__surprise What?! Why?!
__label__anger Because! Because, it-it-its Itd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar
__label__anger All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
__label__non-neutral Great! Great!  Youre making the bike very happy.
__label__non-neutral Okay Ross!  Please dont die!
__label__non-neutral How could you have kept all of this from me?
__label__neutral I was going to tell you, but
__label__anger But what?! You figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
__label__anger Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just  Why dont we just let the machine get that?
__label__neutral Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it.
__label__non-neutral No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-II need to, I need to lie down.
__label__joy Everything on your application looks really goodOhh!
__label__non-neutral Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
__label__neutral Oh dont worry, Im not really a party girl.
__label__non-neutral Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
__label__joy You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! Ill be living here.
__label__non-neutral Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it.
__label__surprise Why did you take the shower curtain down?
__label__fear That thing was a hazard!  Im very safety conscious.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hey man, how did the audition go?
__label__sadness Estelle said I didn't get it.
__label__surprise What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
__label__surprise No!
__label__neutral For all I know, shes trying to find me but couldnt because I kept moving around.
__label__neutral No, from now on, Im staying in one place.
__label__neutral Right here.
__label__neutral Well, its getting late.
__label__neutral Yeah, were gonna go.
__label__neutral Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
__label__neutral Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
__label__neutral Yeah, its a very large plane.
__label__neutral Thats cool.
__label__neutral But, well stay here with you.
__label__joy Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, yknow, but you dont have to rub my butt.
__label__surprise Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
__label__surprise Theyre not a couple!
__label__neutral Oh-okay, I get the game now.
__label__neutral Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
__label__joy Oh yeah!
__label__neutral Well okay, so then youre fine.
__label__neutral The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.
__label__neutral Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Noooo!!
__label__surprise Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, its me! Phoebe!
__label__neutral Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.
__label__surprise Wait a second! So, whats new with you?
__label__neutral Umm, nothing. I mean, Im getting married next week.
__label__surprise And your breasts! Hmm!!!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Umm look, youre coming on a little strong.
__label__neutral But Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together.
__label__neutral So, why dont we just start over okay?
__label__neutral And you can just tell me about yourself.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral I write erotic novels, for children.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Theyre wildly unpopular.
__label__disgust Oh my God!
__label__neutral Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
__label__surprise Wow! You do?
__label__joy Yeah,  a Pretty Huge
__label__disgust All right.
__label__non-neutral So, uh, how's she doing?
__label__sadness The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
__label__non-neutral How-how are you, Mom?
__label__non-neutral Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise What's different?
__label__neutral Nothing.
__label__neutral Oh, maybe that's it.
__label__non-neutral She is unbelievable, our mother is...
__label__neutral Okay, relax, relax.
__label__neutral We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
__label__surprise Oh God!
__label__neutral The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__disgust ...Yeah, they were gross.
__label__joy Oh, you know what I loved?
__label__joy Her Sweet 'n' Los.
__label__joy How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
__label__neutral Not just restaurants, from our house.
__label__neutral Maybe.
__label__surprise You can't!
__label__surprise Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said.
__label__neutral In the hall.
__label__neutral Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.
__label__neutral But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.
__label__neutral Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
__label__neutral Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
__label__joy That's a good one!
__label__neutral Hey, Joe.
__label__neutral Dad, Ronni's here.
__label__surprise Huh?
__label__neutral So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal.
__label__neutral Anything at all.
__label__neutral But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
__label__joy Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
__label__anger Im Monicas maid of honor. Okay? Dont try to blue pin me!
__label__neutral Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.
__label__non-neutral Limited seating my ass. Lets see who made the cut.  Hi!
__label__neutral Im Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
__label__non-neutral Used to work with her. Used to! Im a relative and I didnt get invited! A
__label__non-neutral Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
__label__joy So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
__label__neutral Okay, youre fine.
__label__surprise Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
__label__neutral Youll see.
__label__non-neutral I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
__label__non-neutral Oh God.
__label__neutral Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and yknow fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles
__label__neutral And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and  You go.
__label__neutral But-but, if you dont love this, well do it in any other place at any other time.
__label__neutral Really, its fine, whatever you want.
__label__joy Its perfect.
__label__non-neutral And, I dont know, if it starts to rain
__label__non-neutral Well then well get wet.
__label__sadness Ohh. And I dont even have a date.
__label__neutral Coming.
__label__anger I have a bone to pick with you.
__label__fear Uh-oh.
__label__non-neutral Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
__label__surprise Oh yeah? Did he pull the old
__label__joy Thats right! Thats right!
__label__neutral Oh that.
__label__anger Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! Theyre mean and theyre stupid and-and I dont want my son learning them!
__label__anger Yknow what? It doesnt matter! Because it is not true!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral And if it were true, how
__label__neutral Ms. Monroe  Oh there you go.
__label__surprise Mark's a genius!
__label__surprise Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
__label__non-neutral Look, don't you see what's happening here.
__label__non-neutral Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.
__label__neutral Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
__label__fear What am I going to do?
__label__neutral Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.
__label__neutral All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
__label__fear I don't know you guys.
__label__disgust All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.
__label__disgust And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
__label__non-neutral And before you know it, she's with him.
__label__non-neutral And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'
__label__non-neutral And he'll be all, 'Yes!'
__label__non-neutral And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'
__label__disgust And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'
__label__disgust And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
__label__non-neutral He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
__label__neutral This is what Ive got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
__label__neutral Great. Great.
__label__neutral Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, Ive got you, me, and Chandler and Im gonna invite Gunther cause, well, weve been talking about this pretty loud.
__label__neutral Ill be there.
__label__non-neutral All rightoh!
__label__neutral Listen, I know this is your party, but Id really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
__label__neutral Yeah. Tell ya what, lets not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
__label__neutral Okay! Well need a six-pack of
__label__neutral Hey guys, what are you doing?
__label__neutral Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.
__label__non-neutral Oh, come on!
__label__neutral Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him.
__label__neutral Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there.
__label__neutral Well, Chandler will be there for you too.
__label__neutral I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, hell be there.
__label__neutral And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot.
__label__neutral What do ya say? What do ya say?
__label__neutral Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.
__label__neutral But, all right, I dontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk.
__label__non-neutral I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to name my kid!
__label__non-neutral What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
__label__surprise I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
__label__non-neutral Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
__label__surprise What's that supposed to mean?
__label__neutral Nothing! It's an expression.
__label__neutral No it's not.
__label__neutral Don't listen to your mother.
__label__neutral You're independent, and you always have been!
__label__non-neutral Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!
__label__neutral And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
__label__neutral PBS Telethon.
__label__neutral Hi Joey.
__label__joy Hey Pheebs!
__label__neutral I
__label__surprise $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what
__label__non-neutral Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not
__label__surprise What kind of problem?
__label__non-neutral Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral Nooooo!
__label__non-neutral Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
__label__non-neutral Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
__label__non-neutral I don't wanna give up the bag.
__label__anger I don't have to give up the bag!
__label__non-neutral Do I Rach?
__label__anger Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
__label__neutral Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it
__label__surprise Oh, hey!
__label__non-neutral I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
__label__non-neutral I can't believe I'm hearing this!
__label__non-neutral Wait a minute!
__label__non-neutral Wait a minute!
__label__neutral I'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.
__label__neutral Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
__label__neutral I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
__label__joy Okay, great.
__label__neutral They say he's only got half a tank left.
__label__surprise Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
__label__non-neutral We're switching rooms again.
__label__surprise What? Why?
__label__anger This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
__label__non-neutral Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
__label__non-neutral Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__non-neutral Chandler!
__label__anger Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
__label__anger Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
__label__surprise Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
__label__joy Hey!
__label__surprise Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didnt think you were coming.
__label__joy Oh, I wouldnt miss this.
__label__joy Well, Im very glad youre here.
__label__joy Oh, youre such a gentleman.  Come on! Were going to my place!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hey-hey.
__label__neutral So are guys doing okay?
__label__neutral Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
__label__neutral Do you have a minute?
__label__neutral Well yeah, sure, whats up?
__label__non-neutral I got asked out twice today when I was at lunchby guys.
__label__surprise Oh really?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
__label__non-neutral Oh, did you not want people to know that?
__label__non-neutral But Im not gay. And I especially wouldnt want you to think I was gay.
__label__neutral Whys that?
__label__neutral I dont think I should say.
__label__neutral Ohh, you can say. Come on, I dont want you to feel like you cant tell me things.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Kay.
__label__neutral Well
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Id love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
__label__neutral Yeah, shes gay.
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__joy Great! All right, so Ill call you later.
__label__joy Great!
__label__surprise Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
__label__neutral That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.
__label__surprise Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
__label__neutral No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
__label__surprise Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!
__label__surprise Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
__label__disgust Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
__label__non-neutral What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.
__label__non-neutral Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.
__label__neutral But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.
__label__surprise You got all that from the back of her head?
__label__neutral All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
__label__neutral Whos Elaine?
__label__non-neutral Can you people not see me?!
__label__neutral So, will you talk to him?
__label__neutral I dont know Rach.
__label__non-neutral Oh, come on! Ill give you ten free
__label__anger One!  No ten! You said ten! You cant take that back!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?
__label__neutral We need a porn break.
__label__neutral We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
__label__non-neutral Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?
__label__neutral Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
__label__joy Ooh, good, youre hear! Okay.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__non-neutral Well, what-what cha got there?
__label__joy Oh this, well Im glad you asked.
__label__disgust Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?
__label__non-neutral Ahh!
__label__neutral Now, I know what youre thinking
__label__non-neutral Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
__label__surprise Phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they?
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__neutral Are you sure?
__label__anger No!
__label__neutral Honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
__label__neutral No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
__label__neutral Whats the second part of your plan?
__label__neutral Yes thats right.
__label__surprise Why?
__label__neutral I tired attacking two women, did not work.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral No, I mean its okay, I mean, theyre-theyre my friends.
__label__non-neutral In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
__label__non-neutral Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
__label__surprise Oh, no!
__label__surprise No-no!
__label__surprise No, I tired!
__label__neutral But I couldnt.
__label__non-neutral Thats why Im here.
__label__neutral Maybe we could attack them together?
__label__neutral That-thats a no.
__label__non-neutral What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross!
__label__anger Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross!
__label__anger I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
__label__non-neutral All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
__label__non-neutral No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
__label__neutral No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
__label__joy I like that.
__label__neutral Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
__label__neutral Huh?
__label__neutral One swift kick and hell back off.
__label__neutral All right, bad ankle, got it!
__label__neutral And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesnt wear a cup.
__label__joy Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
__label__neutral And uh, Liam, Liams got bad knees. You hit him right and hell go down like a lamp.
__label__non-neutral But-but, Liams on my team.
__label__anger I dont care! You just get him!
__label__joy Im gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
__label__joy The Red Ross! Okay.
__label__neutral Oh!  Oh by the way?
__label__neutral Uh-hmm.
__label__neutral James Brolin?
__label__neutral Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered hes gay.
__label__neutral Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Hello?
__label__neutral Hello, is Ross there?
__label__neutral Uh no, hes not. Can I take a message?
__label__neutral Yes, this Russell, Rosss divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I havent heard from him, I assume hes decided to give the marriage a try.
__label__surprise Ross got married againNooooooo!!!!!!!!!
__label__non-neutral Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking!
__label__non-neutral Oh!  Shes growing inside you.
__label__surprise Whoa!!
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__surprise Wow that was a big one.
__label__non-neutral I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.
__label__non-neutral Oh hey you guys!
__label__neutral Sure, I can hang out til I have to meet ya.  What uhHow come youre not going?
__label__neutral I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
__label__neutral I thought you already have a job.
__label__neutral And people say you dont pay attention.
__label__neutral No, this is a much better job.
__label__neutral Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
__label__surprise Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
__label__neutral Thats what I do now.
__label__neutral Hey Joey, come taste this.
__label__neutral What is it?
__label__anger Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well  Im getting my revenge!
__label__surprise You cooked him?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again.
__label__joy Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow!
__label__joy "Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
__label__non-neutral The front page? You really do live in your own little world, dont ya?
__label__neutral So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
__label__disgust No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
__label__sadness Were never gonna find anybody.
__label__joy Well then let me do it!
__label__non-neutral Joe
__label__non-neutral No-no-no!
__label__neutral Look, Ive been thinking about it.
__label__neutral Im an actor right?
__label__neutral So I wont get nervous talking in front of people.
__label__non-neutral Joey look its really sweet
__label__non-neutral No-no-no-no look no!
__label__non-neutral I wont spit, and I wont stare at Monicas breasts!
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__joy Everyone knows Im an ass man!
__label__neutral That is true.
__label__joy Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.
__label__joy Itll be me!
__label__joy And I swear Ill do a really good job.
__label__joy Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
__label__neutral Yknow, we havent found anybody else.
__label__joy It might be kinda cool.
__label__joy So I can do it?
__label__joy Ah-ha! Too cocky!
__label__non-neutral I still cant believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
__label__neutral Of course I do! And Im gonna give it back to you as soon as theyre done with it at the key shining place.
__label__non-neutral What the hell is that?
__label__surprise Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
__label__neutral You said there was a gas leak in here.
__label__neutral Well why dont you use your key?
__label__neutral Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded.
__label__neutral If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions.
__label__anger Come on!
__label__non-neutral Hurry up.
__label__neutral Oh! We could have done that.
__label__neutral Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about.
__label__sadness Oh, Im so sorry.
__label__non-neutral Um, and maybe Im wrong!
__label__neutral I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more.
__label__surprise You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him?
__label__neutral Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat.
__label__neutral (walking up with this
__label__non-neutral God Ross, what is that?
__label__non-neutral Oh, but its made her so happy.
__label__neutral Little girl misses her cat.
__label__non-neutral Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.
__label__neutral Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral I
__label__non-neutral He is right, isnt he?
__label__neutral Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong.
__label__surprise You think?
__label__neutral Oh-no, hes right.
__label__joy Seven hundred bucks!
__label__joy Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
__label__non-neutral Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
__label__neutral Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
__label__disgust What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
__label__neutral Me too.
__label__neutral Although this city is my home, so.
__label__neutral So thats dumb what I said, dont tell him I said that.
__label__neutral Umm, you make something up.
__label__joy Nice,  thank you.
__label__neutral This is me.
__label__neutral Here.
__label__non-neutral Your eyes are very pretty.
__label__joy Thank you, very much! Oh!  Thank you!
__label__neutral He would like to kiss you.
__label__neutral Okay, y'know what, you dont have to do that now.
__label__non-neutral No-no-no-no!!
__label__surprise Not him, you dont!
__label__neutral Well the moments over.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__non-neutral Oy!
__label__non-neutral Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
__label__neutral Id really prefer a mountain bike.
__label__neutral Janices birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
__label__surprise Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa.
__label__non-neutral Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
__label__disgust Thats a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. I would like to get her something serious.
__label__neutral Oh, you want something serious.
__label__neutral Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas.
__label__neutral Those are dead serious.
__label__non-neutral All right. Look, Im gonna go in here, and you dont buy me anything ever.
__label__fear No, no, you cant, you cant, okay, you cant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, you cant.
__label__surprise Why not?!
__label__neutral Oh God. Uh, okay, heres the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
__label__non-neutral What is the thing?
__label__non-neutral Okay. I went down to the Mattress King showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral They were in his office.
__label__sadness Well she, she wouldnt do that, shes with, shes with me.
__label__non-neutral All right!!
__label__non-neutral Im telling you its like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
__label__surprise Youre drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe Im a little drunk.
__label__joy Oh thats great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please?  There we go.
__label__non-neutral Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
__label__neutral How are you feeling?
__label__neutral You are
__label__non-neutral I really wish that you wouldnt.
__label__neutral Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?
__label__neutral Then we can put you in bed, okay?
__label__neutral Just smile and dont talk to
__label__joy Speech! Speech! Lets hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
__label__non-neutral Pheebs!!
__label__joy Dont you see? Everyones looking at me! The plans working! I didnt even have to take off my top yet!
__label__joy Speech! Come on Monica!
__label__joy Come on!
__label__joy Come on! Speech!
__label__non-neutral Hey Chandler, you cant keep your hands off her for one second!
__label__joy Oh-ho, I think its nice.
__label__neutral Well you have to because maybe its stupid.
__label__joy Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
__label__non-neutral Oh crap!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral The super couldnt figure out what it did.
__label__non-neutral A $200 an hour electrician couldnt figure out what it did.
__label__non-neutral Ive had seven pretty serious shocks.
__label__disgust I officially give up.
__label__joy Thank God.
__label__non-neutral I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
__label__non-neutral See? Im doing it. I am totally doing it.  I lost it.
__label__non-neutral Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
__label__neutral He doesn't have anyone.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
__label__disgust I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
__label__joy Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
__label__neutral Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
__label__neutral You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
__label__neutral Y'know, we don't have to watch this.
__label__non-neutral No way, forget it.
__label__non-neutral C'mon, she's your mom!
__label__neutral Exactly.
__label__joy Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books!
__label__joy I love her books!
__label__joy I cannot get on a plane without one!
__label__joy I mean, this is so cool!
__label__disgust Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
__label__joy C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral And a nice hot cider for Monica.
__label__neutral Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__surprise Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
__label__surprise Oh! That's why.  I'm sorry!
__label__neutral Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
__label__neutral Yes?
__label__non-neutral You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
__label__neutral Yeah I can, it worked real well.
__label__anger No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
__label__anger I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette.
__label__anger Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em.
__label__surprise Who are you talking too?
__label__disgust Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
__label__neutral I am
__label__anger You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.   Backup! Backup!!
__label__fear I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
__label__neutral Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
__label__fear Shh! Get me out of here.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__surprise Ross!
__label__neutral What?
__label__surprise Come here, check this out!
__label__neutral What? Is it the comet?
__label__surprise No! No-no. Look, theres a bug stuck in tar right here.
__label__non-neutral Joey comeI cant believeI bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of natures most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
__label__neutral Yknow, theres
__label__neutral Show me where?
__label__neutral Right-right up here.
__label__neutral Joey wheres the pipe that was holding the door open?
__label__non-neutral I dont know!   Yeah, I do.
__label__anger Joey!
__label__anger What?! All rightHey! Dont look at me! Youre the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid
__label__anger Its called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
__label__surprise Oh no! No! No!
__label__joy Wow! This place is incredible!  Stings penthat he gave to Phoebe.  Come on! Secret passageway!
__label__neutral Hi!
__label__neutral Hi!
__label__neutral Im Trudie.
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__neutral You must be Bens mum.
__label__neutral Why else would I be here?
__label__neutral Do sit down.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy Oh Rach thats great. Thats great.
__label__neutral Hi.. how was the game?
__label__neutral Well..
__label__joy WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
__label__surprise Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
__label__neutral Alan.
__label__joy He was unbelievable.
__label__joy He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
__label__joy I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
__label__joy Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
__label__neutral Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral ..I dunno, a little too Alan?
__label__non-neutral Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
__label__joy I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
__label__joy Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, thats the first A Ive gotten since seventh grade,
__label__non-neutral Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
__label__surprise What the hell!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral All right, lets start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
__label__disgust Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
__label__surprise My God!
__label__surprise These pants are burning up!
__label__surprise Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!
__label__non-neutral What is she trying to kill me?
__label__surprise It's like a volcano in here!
__label__neutral Are you hot?
__label__neutral Okay, it must just be me then.
__label__neutral That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
__label__anger You're driving me crazy with that!
__label__neutral Okay, I'll stop.
__label__non-neutral Dont stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
__label__non-neutral Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
__label__neutral You wanna play?
__label__neutral Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon.
__label__neutral And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
__label__neutral Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
__label__joy All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
__label__non-neutral I'm intrigued.
__label__neutral All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
__label__non-neutral Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
__label__neutral Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
__label__neutral Uh yeah, right here.
__label__joy Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
__label__neutral What's that?
__label__neutral Weeeell, it's rum, and-
__label__neutral I'm sure they'll be here soon.
__label__neutral Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
__label__neutral Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
__label__fear You are really frightening me.
__label__fear Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?
__label__neutral All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
__label__neutral All right, honey, time to start pushing.
__label__fear But they're not here yet!
__label__neutral I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
__label__fear Oh, god.
__label__non-neutral Here we go. Mona umm, I think its time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
__label__neutral Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
__label__non-neutral Aw, we-we are so So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, yknow hanging out with you.
__label__joy And I mean-Im having a lot of fun.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if its just fun.
__label__non-neutral Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right?
__label__neutral So where-where is it going?
__label__surprise Ah!
__label__neutral Thats-thats the real question.
__label__joy And-and the answer isis its going somewherefun.
__label__neutral Now I-I know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger.
__label__fear No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou
__label__non-neutral Im sorry, so umm, so where are we?
__label__neutral Yknow what?
__label__joy I am going to take you out to dinner tonight.
__label__joy I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .
__label__non-neutral No?
__label__surprise Really?
__label__joy They taste so good.
__label__neutral Drum roll.
__label__neutral Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
__label__neutral Nah, youre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
__label__neutral All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
__label__surprise Youre actually going through with this?
__label__non-neutral Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.
__label__neutral Okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
__label__non-neutral You got problems because of you!
__label__non-neutral Not your name!
__label__anger All right, this has got to stop!
__label__anger Chandler is a great name!
__label__non-neutral In factyes,  Im, Im sorry.
__label__neutral I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, Im-Im, Im gonna, Im gonna name the baby Chandler.
__label__surprise Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
__label__neutral It was.
__label__sadness Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, thats not gonna be me, not me.
__label__surprise Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
__label__neutral No.
__label__surprise Whoa. That was really good.
__label__neutral Thanks, any suggestions?
__label__non-neutral Hi!
__label__surprise You-youyou had sex with Ursula?!
__label__fear Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and
__label__surprise You didnt notice she was wearing different clothes?!
__label__non-neutral Well I was just so excited to see you.
__label__disgust Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird.
__label__non-neutral No-no its not!
__label__fear I dont want to lose you!
__label__non-neutral Its-its like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was youYeah it is too weird.
__label__non-neutral So I guess this is it.
__label__non-neutral Yeah.  Maybe its for the best. You smell just like her.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, so do you.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
__label__sadness Manhattan does not have enough stores.
__label__neutral Well,
__label__surprise You can?
__label__neutral Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
__label__neutral Um-hmm.
__label__neutral And a small piece of chocolate.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__sadness Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship
__label__non-neutral I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
__label__non-neutral Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
__label__non-neutral Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
__label__non-neutral I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
__label__surprise Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?
__label__neutral No! No! Not, Paris.
__label__joy Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
__label__non-neutral Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. Thats right, yes, Im being transferred to Yemen!
__label__non-neutral When?
__label__neutral I dont know exactly.
__label__sadness Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
__label__non-neutral But I do know that its some time tomorrow.
__label__joy Ooh, this is it!  Oh, thats him! Thats him!
__label__joy Great! Go get him.
__label__neutral Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
__label__neutral Hes not really my type.
__label__neutral No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see whats he like. People tell doctors everything.
__label__surprise But you said he was this great guy!
__label__sadness But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
__label__sadness You do attract some stinkers.
__label__neutral Chandler.
__label__neutral Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a
__label__neutral Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
__label__neutral Oh, listen.
__label__neutral If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them.
__label__non-neutral Really.
__label__neutral Nothing at all.
__label__non-neutral Really.
__label__neutral Nothing.
__label__neutral Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
__label__non-neutral Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one?
__label__non-neutral No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.
__label__neutral Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out?
__label__non-neutral No, no, I keep trying, yknow?
__label__sadness I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "go to the bathroom."
__label__neutral He may think Im sick.
__label__neutral Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with!
__label__neutral Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral Thats it.
__label__non-neutral Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna order me around all the time?
__label__neutral Pretty much.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__joy Hey Monica!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Hey man, you feeling any better?
__label__neutral Joey, we have something to tell you.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Youre pregnant!
__label__neutral Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, youre only married in Vegas.
__label__neutral What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youre married everywhere.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Yeah!
__label__surprise Oh my God!Eh! Well
__label__disgust You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave hes going straight to the porn.
__label__neutral Hes gonna go up to the counter with
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral I missed this.
__label__non-neutral Me too.
__label__neutral So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
__label__joy Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
__label__anger Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
__label__neutral We will.
__label__neutral Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
__label__neutral No Mon,
__label__neutral Every year.
__label__neutral And
__label__joy Hey! Ross!
__label__neutral Die Hard
__label__neutral Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
__label__neutral Whatd you rent?
__label__neutral Die Hard 2
__label__neutral Joey, this is
__label__neutral Oh, well we watch it a second time and its
__label__neutral Joey, we
__label__neutral And?
__label__joy And itll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
__label__neutral Die Hard
__label__neutral Dude, you didnt say
__label__neutral Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
__label__non-neutral Well, John McClane had plans!
__label__neutral No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
__label__non-neutral What are you talking about? Bitch.
__label__non-neutral I know you botched that operation on purpose.
__label__anger I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder.
__label__disgust I don't care if you    are my brother.
__label__joy Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch!
__label__anger Stop going through my stuff !
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__non-neutral I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
__label__fear No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
__label__non-neutral Please, what about you and Chandler?
__label__non-neutral That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
__label__non-neutral Well hello !
__label__non-neutral What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?
__label__anger I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
__label__non-neutral Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
__label__non-neutral I'm gonna do it.
__label__neutral And I can't stop you.
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
__label__neutral I'm smarter than
__label__non-neutral Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
__label__joy Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
__label__neutral Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im heading up there.
__label__neutral Uh, yeah, Ill take a coffee. Thanks, man.
__label__non-neutral Sure.  Coffee? Cause Im going up there.
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral No, thank you.
__label__neutral You guys need anything, cause Im heading up there.
__label__neutral Id love an ice water.
__label__neutral You got it.
__label__surprise Joey, what are you doing?
__label__non-neutral Just being friendly.
__label__non-neutral Joey, honey, I dont think youre supposed to go back there.
__label__neutral Nah, its okay. Right, Gunther?
__label__non-neutral Dont wink at me. And put on your apron.
__label__non-neutral Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
__label__surprise Joey, do you work here?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Hey, waiter.
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening.  Yeah we are.
__label__neutral Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.
__label__neutral Im calling for Monica Geller.
__label__neutral I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
__label__surprise This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!!
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__non-neutral I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
__label__neutral Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am
__label__non-neutral This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
__label__neutral So go fix it!
__label__neutral Go find Chandler!
__label__non-neutral He's probably up in your room!
__label__non-neutral Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
__label__joy Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
__label__joy Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
__label__neutral Anybody lose this?
__label__joy Comin' out. Place your bet.  Dice are out.  Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
__label__neutral Hmm.
__label__neutral Do you remember where the duck food is?
__label__surprise Yeah, its in the guys apartment under the sink. Why?
__label__neutral Because Im going to London.
__label__surprise What?! What do you mean youre going to London?
__label__neutral Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.
__label__neutral Now honey, you take care, you dont have those babies until I get back.
__label__non-neutral IRachel, you cant go! Ross loves Emily!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does.
__label__non-neutral But I have to tell him how I feel!
__label__neutral He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
__label__non-neutral Thats not why youre going!
__label__non-neutral Youre going because you hope hes gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach.
__label__non-neutral Forget that British chippy."
__label__surprise OhhDo you think he will?!
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__non-neutral Because hes in love with the British chippy!
__label__non-neutral Look, Rachel, if you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!
__label__anger Yknow, its too late!
__label__sadness You missed youre chance!
__label__sadness Im sorry, I know this must be really hard, its over.
__label__non-neutral Yknow what? No. Its not over until someone says, "I do."
__label__non-neutral I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. Im carrying a litter.
__label__neutral So is everybody here?
__label__neutral I got here a little early myself.
__label__neutral Let us begin.
__label__neutral Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.
__label__neutral Here.
__label__neutral Here.
__label__neutral Now as for the hydrosaurs
__label__neutral Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night.
__label__sadness Ive ah, Ive recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry.
__label__sadness So, do you think you can forgive me?
__label__joy Great.
__label__joy Thanks.
__label__neutral Okay, bye.
__label__neutral Hello, Jennifer?
__label__surprise Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there?
__label__surprise Oh, shes not home huh?
__label__neutral Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Are you all right?
__label__fear Uhh… I think I just got engaged.
__label__surprise Oh my God! He did it?
__label__non-neutral Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?
__label__surprise Are you kidding?
__label__non-neutral I'm like the one who talked him into it.
__label__non-neutral I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
__label__non-neutral And you really think this is a good idea?
__label__neutral I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people.
__label__non-neutral I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.
__label__surprise Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so.
__label__surprise Really?! Even Ross?
__label__joy Especially Ross!
__label__neutral Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come  back later.
__label__surprise Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just…I'll  come back.
__label__joy There he goes, your fiancée.
__label__neutral I guess so.
__label__neutral Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
__label__neutral I can't say that I'm surprised.
__label__sadness Oh, that is so unfortunate.
__label__neutral What?
__label__non-neutral Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
__label__neutral Okay, Ill be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe Im sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
__label__neutral You didnt leave lipstick marks on the phone.
__label__neutral Oh, then it mustve been you. Bye.
__label__non-neutral Bye-bye!  Thats why I moved out.
__label__neutral Hey, y'know while were on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you dont live here anymore.
__label__neutral I think on some levels she already knows.
__label__neutral Night Mon. Night Julio.
__label__neutral Adios.
__label__surprise Look Julio, someone left their book here.
__label__neutral Ah actually, that is mine.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, what are you reading?
__label__neutral Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
__label__neutral Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?
__label__neutral I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
__label__neutral Your a poet and don't know it.
__label__neutral Actually I ah, I am a poet.
__label__neutral Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?
__label__neutral Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
__label__neutral Mine?  Right here?
__label__joy I can write an epic poem about this lip.
__label__joy How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
__label__neutral Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral Were at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
__label__surprise Are we really in Montreal?!
__label__neutral Yes we are. So, coffee?
__label__non-neutral Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
__label__neutral Oh, no. But its just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
__label__neutral Okay, heres batch 22.
__label__non-neutral Oh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers.
__label__neutral This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
__label__neutral Lets give it a shot.
__label__neutral Okay. Man, I have
__label__surprise Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
__label__neutral No, just a Friday night.
__label__neutral Would she?
__label__anger Would she?  You ate my candy bar!
__label__disgust Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
__label__sadness I know honey, Im sorry.
__label__sadness Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in.
__label__non-neutral Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
__label__sadness Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt....
__label__disgust I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
__label__anger Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
__label__fear Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
__label__anger Its not funny, this is actually my job.
__label__neutral Oh believe me, I-I-Ive been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
__label__non-neutral Oh well then, so Im just going to go back to talking to my friend here.
__label__non-neutral And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
__label__neutral Ah, just one other thing.
__label__non-neutral Yes?!
__label__neutral I ah, I work at
__label__neutral Do you want my pickle?
__label__neutral Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
__label__surprise Why?
__label__neutral Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral Phoebe.
__label__non-neutral Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
__label__joy Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.
__label__non-neutral He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
__label__joy We should do something. Whistle.
__label__non-neutral We are not going to whistle.
__label__neutral Come on, do it.
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__joy Do it!
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__joy Do it do it do it!
__label__joy Woo-woo!
__label__surprise I can't believe you did that!
__label__neutral Hi! Umm, Im Monica Geller, Im the chef at Alessandros.
__label__surprise Still?
__label__non-neutral I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
__label__non-neutral I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
__label__anger Either eat it, or be in it.
__label__non-neutral Spoon?  So, what do you think?
__label__disgust Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.
__label__non-neutral Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; theres a new class comin in.
__label__neutral Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
__label__neutral I can.
__label__neutral Okay, go ahead.
__label__neutral Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
__label__neutral Thats very good, whats your name?
__label__neutral Monica.
__label__neutral Monica, you go to the head of the class.
__label__joy Okay.
__label__neutral And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,    it's a place I've never seeeeen.
__label__neutral But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen.
__label__neutral Humaaan spleeeeen.
__label__joy Olè!
__label__surprise What are you doing here!
__label__joy Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain!
__label__joy Great!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy It really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
__label__non-neutral Listen Phoebe...
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but...
__label__neutral But what?
__label__neutral This is kind of a classy place.
__label__neutral Ok, say no more.
__label__non-neutral I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
__label__neutral Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
__label__non-neutral Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
__label__non-neutral Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
__label__neutral I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention
__label__neutral Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
__label__non-neutral We can't. We're not pharmacists!
__label__neutral I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba...
__label__neutral Kate Miller?
__label__neutral Kate Miller it is.
__label__non-neutral And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
__label__neutral In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__sadness We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
__label__non-neutral This year was supposed to be great!
__label__disgust But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
__label__sadness No. No, you're not a loser.
__label__non-neutral Look at me!
__label__joy Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
__label__non-neutral Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
__label__joy See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy That really is something; that's really cool.
__label__joy Howdy partner!
__label__joy Maybe I should get another pair!
__label__joy Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.
__label__joy I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.
__label__non-neutral I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
__label__joy I would make a good cowboy.
__label__neutral Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.
__label__non-neutral No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
__label__surprise Oh yeah!
__label__neutral Great nap.
__label__neutral It really was.
__label__non-neutral Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.
__label__neutral So, lets talk about women. Im sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.
__label__neutral Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin?"
__label__disgust Oh, please!
__label__neutral Hey, how you doin?
__label__neutral Hey Mikey
__label__neutral Hey P
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral Setting rat traps.
__label__surprise To kill Bob??
__label__neutral No, no, to test his neck strength.
__label__non-neutral No, Mike, I don't want to kill him!
__label__non-neutral I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
__label__neutral Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
__label__neutral I'll find Bob, I'll get him.
__label__fear Bob?
__label__non-neutral Bob!
__label__non-neutral Robert!
__label__non-neutral Oh wait, I think I hear him.
__label__surprise Oh - Oh my god!
__label__surprise Bob    had babies!
__label__surprise Bob's a mom!
__label__non-neutral Better think of a new name for him.
__label__neutral I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
__label__neutral I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ...
__label__non-neutral Oh my god, we killed Bob!
__label__neutral Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
__label__neutral Suzie?
__label__joy Hmmm, soup!
__label__neutral Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
__label__neutral Oh yeah, no problem.
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__sadness Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection.
__label__surprise Joey!
__label__surprise What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
__label__anger Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!
__label__anger So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.
__label__anger I said, "No!"
__label__neutral Which puts
__label__non-neutral Great. So the ball is in his court?
__label__non-neutral Ball? There is no ball.
__label__surprise Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
__label__neutral Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
__label__surprise What?! Why?!
__label__neutral Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and
__label__non-neutral Oh great! That
__label__neutral Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's
__label__neutral Do-do you, do you have brothers?
__label__neutral No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
__label__neutral Are you close with them?
__label__neutral No-no, they're not very nice people.
__label__neutral Okay, listen, I really like you.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral I think this can go somewhere.
__label__neutral So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
__label__neutral Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of
__label__neutral Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
__label__non-neutral Its over.
__label__non-neutral Oh, was it awful?
__label__non-neutral Well, it was loong.
__label__neutral I didnt even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 oclock shadow on her head.
__label__sadness Anyway, she didnt want to stay.
__label__neutral I called a cab; she just left.
__label__neutral I wrote you a letter.
__label__joy Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
__label__neutral Its just some things Ive been thinking about.
__label__neutral Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
__label__neutral Okay.  Wow, its-its 5:30 in the morning.  So, Id better get cracking on this baby.
__label__neutral Well, Ill be waiting for you, just come up when youre done.
__label__non-neutral Okay, Ill be up in,  18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
__label__non-neutral The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
__label__neutral Well, you said that we except the
__label__neutral All right, that Ill retract.
__label__disgust But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasnt it.
__label__disgust Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice!
__label__disgust You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
__label__anger Hey! Im proud of that sauce, its delicious.
__label__surprise Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
__label__neutral Lebanon.
__label__non-neutral Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
__label__neutral How long is this gonna take? Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
__label__neutral Okay, then what happened?
__label__non-neutral Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn!
__label__neutral Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
__label__anger Nothing!   This is not over!
__label__anger No! No! No!
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in  Actually, thanks!
__label__neutral All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
__label__sadness Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__sadness Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
__label__neutral Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
__label__neutral That's okay, Joe.
__label__neutral All right, let's go Pheebs.
__label__surprise Oh God!
__label__joy That was amazing.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__joy Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?
__label__joy We may have just started a family.
__label__joy Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
__label__neutral And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
__label__non-neutral Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You cant just stare through the peep hole for three hours! Youre gonna get peep eye!
__label__surprise I knew it!
__label__non-neutral I knew it!
__label__non-neutral I always knew she liked him!
__label__non-neutral Y'know, shed say no, but here we are!
__label__neutral Right?
__label__non-neutral We just broke up, first thing she does!
__label__neutral You didnt just break up.
__label__anger Hey, its been like three weeks!
__label__disgust You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
__label__neutral Thats Bill Clinton.
__label__neutral Whos he huggin?
__label__surprise Oh my God! Thats Pete! But why is Bill huggin Pete?
__label__non-neutral This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
__label__joy We use it!!
__label__joy There you go!!
__label__surprise Oh my God, Monicas gonna go out with a millionaire.
__label__neutral Im not gonna go out with him.
__label__surprise Oh my God, I cant believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
__label__non-neutral Or incredibly offensive.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, sure, that too.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah!
__label__non-neutral Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily.
__label__neutral Well, there's this one thing Okay,  here goes.
__label__surprise I made a promise that--Oh hey!
__label__neutral What?
__label__surprise You're nose is bleeding!
__label__non-neutral Oh God.
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__anger Oh not again!
__label__sadness This-this happened when my grandfather died.
__label__disgust It's ugh!
__label__sadness Sorry.
__label__neutral Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
__label__neutral Umm
__label__sadness Sorry. Sorry.
__label__sadness Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
__label__non-neutral Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
__label__neutral Hello, Chip.
__label__non-neutral Hey, Rach! How ya doin?
__label__joy Im great! Im great. Ive got a great job at
__label__neutral So ah, Monica ready yet?
__label__neutral Shell be out in a second. So, Chip, hows umm, Amy Welch?
__label__surprise Amy Welch? Wow! I havent seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
__label__joy Thats right, I love you! And-and Im gonna play with you all the time.
__label__surprise How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
__label__neutral Hes talking to the baby.
__label__surprise Ohh!
__label__surprise Okay!
__label__surprise Okay, cause when-when he said, "I cant wait to hear your first words," I thought, "Theres a trick."
__label__neutral Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. Ill see you later.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__surprise Oh my, oh my God!
__label__surprise Aw, its unbelievable!
__label__surprise Wow!
__label__surprise She is kicking so much!
__label__joy Oh, shes like ummohwhos that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
__label__neutral Mia Hamm?
__label__non-neutral Mia Hamm!
__label__non-neutral Oh thats amazing.
__label__surprise Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
__label__surprise Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
__label__neutral Okay, what do you guys think?
__label__surprise Dude!
__label__non-neutral I have never known love like this.
__label__surprise You really like it?
__label__surprise Dude! How-how did you write this?
__label__neutral I stole Monicas and changed the name.
__label__neutral You cant
__label__joy If he goes first he can!
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__non-neutral Yeah!
__label__neutral Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, yknow?
__label__neutral Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
__label__joy Oh wow thats a great idea! And
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__non-neutral Oh.
__label__joy Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one.
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__neutral Yknow I gotta tell ya, sometimes I justI dont get Chandler.
__label__neutral Yknow, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you dont get all upset.
__label__non-neutral All the time?
__label__non-neutral All the time!
__label__neutral Cassie, how you-how you doin on thathot dog.
__label__neutral Im all done.
__label__joy Thank God.
__label__neutral I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
__label__neutral Oh right.
__label__neutral Right.
__label__joy Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you til you cried?
__label__sadness Were probably too old to do that now.
__label__joy Ill always remember that summer, because its when I got all of these freckles.
__label__joy Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and Ill always remember that summer because thats when I realized that we are related.
__label__surprise It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
__label__neutral Well Im, Im a little slow.  Just as our children would be.
__label__neutral Relax every muscle in your body.
__label__neutral Listen to the plinky-plunky music.
__label__neutral Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place.
__label__neutral Okay, tell me your happy place.
__label__joy Richard's living room, drinking wine.
__label__anger All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
__label__non-neutral I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
__label__neutral Well, okay, fine, use my happy place.
__label__neutral Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
__label__neutral All right, I'll try not to.
__label__neutral Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
__label__sadness Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
__label__joy All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
__label__sadness I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
__label__neutral All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__joy Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains.
__label__neutral And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
__label__disgust Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
__label__neutral OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
__label__neutral See you later Rach.
__label__neutral Bye-bye Julie.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
__label__neutral Hey?
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral Can I ask you somethin'?
__label__non-neutral Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__neutral Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
__label__neutral What's up?
__label__neutral F.Y.I..
__label__neutral I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons.
__label__neutral Her name is Stephanie... something.
__label__neutral She's supposed to be very good.
__label__surprise But what about Phoebe?
__label__disgust Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
__label__sadness Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
__label__neutral Uh...
__label__non-neutral Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
__label__non-neutral Ahh, no.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__surprise Are you jealous?
__label__non-neutral Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all.
__label__non-neutral I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
__label__non-neutral You are totally jealous.
__label__non-neutral I'm not jealous.
__label__neutral All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers.
__label__neutral And y'know, and um, I...
__label__neutral Honey, I love you too.
__label__non-neutral Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise Huh.
__label__non-neutral Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
__label__neutral Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
__label__surprise I cant believe you came back.
__label__non-neutral Dont say anything.
__label__neutral I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna think.
__label__joy I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
__label__joy Rachel! Rachel!
__label__neutral What?
__label__surprise You missed the exit!
__label__neutral Oh, sorry.
__label__surprise My God, what were you thinking about?
__label__neutral Um,  Barry.
__label__non-neutral Awwww!!
__label__surprise I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
__label__non-neutral Dude!
__label__joy And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.
__label__surprise God!
__label__non-neutral All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
__label__neutral Well actually, Ross doesn't.
__label__neutral Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
__label__neutral Dear Mary-Angela.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hows it going.
__label__non-neutral This is the hardest letter Ive ever had to write.
__label__disgust What the hells a matter with you?
__label__non-neutral How do you think Joeys going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
__label__neutral Well, thats the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually Ill be in Cuba.
__label__neutral All right, look, look, youve got to do this yourself, okay in person.
__label__neutral At least you know her name.
__label__neutral You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
__label__non-neutral What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
__label__non-neutral Where in Cuba?
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
__label__surprise Oh! I knew it! What happened?
__label__non-neutral Umm, she kissed me.
__label__surprise What?! You kissed!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?
__label__neutral A two and a five.
__label__joy Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Oh yeah! Okay, lets play again.  What do you got?
__label__neutral A four and a nine.
__label__surprise Youre kidding right?
__label__neutral No. Why?
__label__surprise Well thats a full cup!
__label__joy Damn! I am good at Cups!
__label__surprise What? Why? Where are you?
__label__neutral Im still on the set!
__label__non-neutral Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
__label__non-neutral I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go until we get this.
__label__non-neutral Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister.
__label__non-neutral No! No, Im the minister! Alright, look-look, put em both on the phone, Ill marry them right now.
__label__non-neutral Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
__label__anger Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I have the power!
__label__non-neutral Oh hey Joey! What's up?
__label__neutral I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
__label__neutral Yeah, I've been around.
__label__neutral Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
__label__neutral Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.
__label__surprise Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees!
__label__neutral Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.
__label__joy Great! Problem solved!
__label__non-neutral Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
__label__neutral All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
__label__surprise Why?
__label__non-neutral Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
__label__anger Bastard!
__label__surprise You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping orOh!
__label__surprise All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
__label__non-neutral Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__surprise Oh, I can't believe it!
__label__joy I mean I think it's great!
__label__neutral For him.
__label__neutral She might be able to do better.
__label__neutral Hey guys!
__label__neutral Joey! Come here! Come here!
__label__surprise What? What?
__label__neutral Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
__label__neutral You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
__label__neutral No. Joey, she
__label__surprise Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
__label__neutral Yes, but y'know what?
__label__neutral It doesn't matter who knows what.
__label__neutral Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!
__label__joy Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
__label__neutral It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
__label__neutral Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta change things.
__label__surprise You really think it would be that different?
__label__surprise How could it not be?
__label__sadness I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
__label__sadness And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a
__label__neutral Well, things change.
__label__sadness I dont want them to move to a
__label__neutral Itll be okay Joe.
__label__surprise Its still there!
__label__neutral Mrs. Braverman must be out.
__label__non-neutral She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.
__label__fear By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
__label__fear No that could kill her.
__label__neutral Well, we dont want that.
__label__neutral No, so were protecting her.
__label__neutral But we should take it.
__label__non-neutral But we should move quick.
__label__surprise Why?
__label__non-neutral Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
__label__fear Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
__label__neutral Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
__label__neutral Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
__label__neutral Well, you're gonna.
__label__neutral I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
__label__neutral Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
__label__neutral Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.
__label__non-neutral And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?
__label__neutral Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
__label__neutral Hey, you're not him.
__label__neutral You're you.
__label__neutral When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.
__label__non-neutral Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!
__label__neutral And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
__label__non-neutral You really think so?
__label__neutral Yeah. I really do.
__label__neutral Thanks, Chandler.
__label__non-neutral Get off!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
__label__neutral When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
__label__neutral And the cream?
__label__neutral Cheese makes me thirsty.
__label__neutral Okay. Lets move on.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__surprise Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! Youve never made this before?
__label__surprise Oh no!
__label__neutral I dont know anything about cooking.
__label__neutral I had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
__label__joy Well, hats off to the chef.
__label__neutral I-I-Im sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didnt hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
__label__joy The chef!
__label__joy Thats right.
__label__neutral Hey, Pheebs.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral How's it going?
__label__non-neutral Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
__label__neutral So what's going on?
__label__neutral Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
__label__neutral I dunno, there's just something about...
__label__neutral Basically we just feel that he's...
__label__disgust We hate that guy.
__label__disgust Yeah. Hate him.
__label__sadness We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
__label__disgust ...No, we hate him.
__label__sadness We're sorry.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
__label__non-neutral Yes that was mine.
__label__non-neutral 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
__label__non-neutral Yes that would have made more sense.
__label__anger Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!
__label__neutral All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time.
__label__neutral And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.
__label__non-neutral Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?
__label__surprise !
__label__non-neutral Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
__label__non-neutral Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
__label__surprise She said what?
__label__neutral She said, "If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
__label__non-neutral Postpone it?
__label__non-neutral Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?
__label__non-neutral Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?
__label__neutral This isnt right.
__label__non-neutral I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure theyll come back when we can do it right.
__label__non-neutral I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
__label__anger Dont you point your pants at me!
__label__anger We have no choice!
__label__non-neutral Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross dont you understand?
__label__non-neutral This is our wedding Im talking about.
__label__neutral The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when were getting married.
__label__non-neutral So what are you saying? Its now or never?
__label__neutral No. Im saying its now.
__label__non-neutral Or?
__label__non-neutral Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
__label__non-neutral Its not the pants.
__label__non-neutral Its you that is backwards.
__label__anger And if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all!
__label__sadness No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please
__label__neutral Hi, honey.
__label__neutral See you later.
__label__non-neutral What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
__label__anger Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
__label__neutral Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller.
__label__surprise Oh no!
__label__neutral I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
__label__non-neutral Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!!
__label__surprise This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
__label__anger NOOOO!!!!!!!!
__label__surprise Ma! What're you doing here?
__label__neutral I came to give you this  and this.
__label__surprise Oww! Big ring!
__label__neutral Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
__label__non-neutral Do you uh, do you talk about me?
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah, all the time.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
__label__disgust Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
__label__disgust Have you ever seen so much crap?
__label__non-neutral Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
__label__neutral Check this out. Can I have this?
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.
__label__neutral All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.
__label__non-neutral It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
__label__sadness If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
__label__joy Fortunately, it is me.
__label__joy And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.
__label__joy Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate.
__label__neutral Y'know, someplace nice.
__label__neutral Yeah, someplace nice.
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__non-neutral How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
__label__neutral So, what do you think?
__label__joy I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
__label__joy I know!
__label__neutral So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
__label__joy Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
__label__joy Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!
__label__surprise Whats this?
__label__neutral Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
__label__neutral Gotcha.
__label__neutral This place is really my Grandmothers.
__label__neutral I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.
__label__neutral So if the landlord ever asks, Im 87 year old woman, whos afraid of her VCR.
__label__neutral So are you thirsty?
__label__non-neutral Oh, you bet I am!
__label__non-neutral Okay, heres your penis!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral How was your first day?
__label__neutral Ohh, okay.
__label__joy Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
__label__neutral Thank you, its my moms. So this is the kitchen.
__label__neutral Hey, ready for dinner?
__label__joy Ooh, absolutely!
__label__joy Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
__label__neutral Ooh, I love that place!  So, no.
__label__neutral How about Mama Lisettie's?
__label__neutral Enh. Sure!
__label__disgust I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out.
__label__neutral Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!
__label__neutral Thatthis milk is mine.
__label__neutral I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.
__label__joy Okay, let's go!
__label__non-neutral Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the
__label__neutral But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
__label__disgust Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
__label__anger Okay, stop!
__label__neutral Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?
__label__non-neutral Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
__label__neutral Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
__label__non-neutral Thank you.
__label__non-neutral Okay, go!
__label__neutral Go!
__label__non-neutral Go!
__label__disgust Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
__label__non-neutral No! No! Phoebe, come on! I dont want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
__label__joy No but at Monicas you can eat cookies over the sink!
__label__sadness I know. Im sorry.
__label__neutral All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral God, what a mess.
__label__neutral Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
__label__sadness Well, I lost.
__label__sadness Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.
__label__non-neutral Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
__label__joy Hey! Howd the interview go?
__label__sadness Oh, I blew it. I wouldnt of even hired me.
__label__sadness Oh, come here sweetie, listen, youre gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.
__label__sadness Thats not how that was supposed to come out.
__label__sadness This is the worst Christmas ever.
__label__neutral Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
__label__anger I cant!
__label__anger Its too late!
__label__sadness Terry already hired that girl over there.
__label__sadness Look at her, shes even got waitress experience.
__label__sadness Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.
__label__neutral That word was swans.
__label__surprise What do we got there?
__label__surprise A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
__label__joy You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
__label__neutral It's all right.
__label__neutral It's all right.
__label__neutral You don't have to explain.
__label__neutral This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
__label__neutral You're our third call tonight.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
__label__sadness I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
__label__neutral No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
__label__joy Thank God. Food.
__label__neutral Phoebe?
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral Do you have a plan?
__label__non-neutral I don't even have a 'pl'.
__label__non-neutral No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
__label__surprise Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
__label__surprise Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
__label__non-neutral Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
__label__non-neutral And-and a power tie?
__label__surprise Oh God.
__label__surprise Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
__label__neutral Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
__label__neutral Big Bird's friend.
__label__joy I see pizza!
__label__joy Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
__label__non-neutral Hello? Who are we spying on?
__label__neutral Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
__label__neutral What?!
__label__joy I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
__label__disgust No, no!
__label__disgust What are you crazy?!
__label__non-neutral Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, its like a law!
__label__neutral Allll done!

__label__neutral Come on, please?! Im boredddd! You let me do it once before.
__label__non-neutral Yeah well, if ah, if thats the rule this weekend...  No!
__label__surprise Its beautiful! Its like the first bathroom floor there ever was.  Whoa! Are you going in there for?
__label__neutral What, like a number?
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hi! Bye!
__label__neutral Okay, Im done with my choices, these are final.
__label__non-neutral Well, its about time.
__label__neutral Ooh, very official.
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
__label__neutral And who laminated it?
__label__neutral That would be me.
__label__neutral All right let me see.  Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
__label__non-neutral Hey, its my list.
__label__neutral Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
__label__neutral Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the

__label__non-neutral Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early
__label__non-neutral Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
__label__non-neutral Oh no, I'm fully qualified to

__label__anger Doogie, shh!
__label__surprise Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon?

__label__non-neutral No! You dont know the system! Therell be nobody messing with the system!
__label__neutral Your license please.
__label__neutral You dont-you dont want to hear about my dream OfficerPretty?
__label__neutral Its Petty.  Ill be right back with your ticket.
__label__surprise You have a son!
__label__neutral I know. I know.
__label__neutral Uh, like, could these margaritas

__label__joy Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
__label__neutral Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk
__label__neutral Sure.
__label__neutral No problem.
__label__non-neutral You have to give 'em something, you know.
__label__neutral Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
__label__neutral Petrie.
__label__neutral Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working
__label__non-neutral ....right?
__label__non-neutral Right?
__label__non-neutral I mean its pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back.
__label__non-neutral Y'know I dont, I dont need them, huh, Ive got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
__label__joy Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
__label__surprise 717?  Wheres 717?  Hey, youve have more of these for Susan right?
__label__neutral No. But its okay, Ill just put out pickles or something.
__label__joy Ross, thank God.
__label__surprise Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
__label__disgust I ate a bug.
__label__non-neutral Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Lets stock up.
__label__fear Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we dont know where we are, so we cant get a tow truck.
__label__non-neutral Oh, now you want a favour?
__label__neutral Yes, please.
__label__anger Well, oh, Im sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but Im a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
__label__neutral Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
__label__non-neutral No, Im not gonna pick them up.
__label__neutral Listen, we both know youre gonna do it cause youre not a jerk.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__non-neutral So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
__label__non-neutral No, Rachel doesnt want me to....
__label__neutral Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but dont punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
__label__neutral Yeah, youre right.
__label__sadness God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
__label__sadness Oh, I know.
__label__sadness I kinda feel like it's my fault.
__label__anger Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
__label__anger Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
__label__non-neutral Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
__label__neutral All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
__label__non-neutral Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
__label__anger Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.
__label__non-neutral Okay, I admit it!
__label__joy I love this coat!
__label__joy Okay, Iit's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley!
__label__neutral Remember Phil Huntley?
__label__joy He was fine!
__label__joy So your dad dropped by. Hes a pleasant man!
__label__fear Oh no
__label__neutral Id better go. (She goes and sits down in the
__label__sadness Ross Im so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
__label__anger I dont care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now shes totally freaked out!
__label__neutral Oh okay, Ill fix that to. Whats her e-mail address?
__label__anger Rachel!
__label__non-neutral All right, I promise. Ill fix this. I swear. Ill-Ill-Ill-Ill talk to her.
__label__anger Okay!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Thank you!
__label__non-neutral Thats it?!
__label__surprise You call that a fight?
__label__non-neutral Come on!
__label__non-neutral "We were on a break!"
__label__non-neutral "No we werent!"
__label__surprise What happened to you two?
__label__surprise !
__label__neutral Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
__label__neutral I'm sorry.
__label__neutral But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it.
__label__neutral Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
__label__neutral Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
__label__surprise Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the
__label__neutral I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
__label__non-neutral Is this because of the burrito thing?
__label__neutral You need to give him money.
__label__surprise Give him money? It was a joke!
__label__non-neutral No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
__label__neutral Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
__label__neutral You've got to be smooth about it.
__label__neutral Hey, I can be smooth.
__label__neutral Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
__label__neutral Of course, sir.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Id better get back to my desk.
__label__joy Okay, you hard worker! Ill remember to put that in your evaluation.
__label__surprise My what?
__label__neutral Well, youve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation.
__label__neutral But yknow, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
__label__surprise Are you serious?
__label__neutral No, Ive just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
__label__neutral I can blow dry it.
__label__neutral I can put gel on it.
__label__neutral It doesnt matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head.
__label__disgust Its so annoying.
__label__non-neutral Does it bug you?
__label__disgust You bug me.
__label__neutral Is there any chance you didnt see that?
__label__neutral Hey Joey, what cha doing?
__label__neutral Sweepin. Why? Turn you on?
__label__non-neutral No.
__label__non-neutral Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
__label__neutral Joey, did
__label__non-neutral Where are you going? The vicar wont be home for hours.
__label__surprise Joey,  where did you learn that word?
__label__neutral Where do you think,  Zelda?
__label__non-neutral You found my book?!
__label__non-neutral Yeah I did!
__label__anger Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
__label__surprise Okay, look Im sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldnt have, but you got porn!
__label__anger Hey-hey, yknow what?
__label__anger I dont care!
__label__non-neutral Im not ashamed of my book.
__label__neutral Theres nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a littleerotica.
__label__non-neutral Its just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
__label__non-neutral You got porn!
__label__joy Well, I feel like a snack!
__label__neutral Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are.
__label__neutral Oh no thanks. I dont like
__label__surprise What?!
__label__sadness Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
__label__neutral Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__non-neutral No-no theyre not.
__label__anger Theyre still very angry!
__label__neutral But yknow Chandler is also half-Swedish.
__label__neutral You know what the Swedish people are famous for?
__label__non-neutral Sitting down and being quiet.
__label__neutral Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more
__label__anger You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
__label__surprise How did you know about that?!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Come in.
__label__neutral Thanks for comin back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and
__label__joy Great!
__label__neutral Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match.
__label__neutral Okay, so I made up a little test.
__label__neutral Now, Im gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
__label__neutral I can do that.
__label__neutral Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
__label__neutral Fight.
__label__joy Very good! Okay. G.
__label__neutral String?
__label__joy Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
__label__neutral Kitten?
__label__non-neutral Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, butbye-bye!
__label__disgust Dad, please dont pick your teeth out here!
__label__disgust Alright, and if youre gonna put your feet up, why dont you sit on the-
__label__non-neutral Monica, leave him alone
__label__non-neutral Will you hurry up?
__label__surprise Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janines friends are dancers?!
__label__non-neutral And that theyre going to be drinking alot!
__label__surprise ?
__label__neutral No, I did, but tell me again, because its so romantic.
__label__anger Well youre whippin so slow! Cant you do it any faster?
__label__anger Joey!
__label__anger Come on!
__label__non-neutral I dont wanna make any mistakes, alright?
__label__fear This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?
__label__neutral So why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
__label__joy Oh I am!
__label__anger Ross, if you dont tell them, then I will!
__label__non-neutral Okay, fine!
__label__neutral Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
__label__neutral Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it cant? Okay.
__label__joy You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
__label__joy Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
__label__joy Okay, now you're even cuter!!
__label__neutral Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
__label__surprise What are you talking about?
__label__joy I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
__label__non-neutral That's not possible!
__label__surprise Ow!
__label__non-neutral I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
__label__non-neutral Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
__label__sadness I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
__label__anger No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
__label__surprise This bicep?
__label__non-neutral Well it's not flexed right now!
__label__neutral It's Phoebe.
__label__sadness Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
__label__sadness Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
__label__sadness No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
__label__non-neutral No you didn't!
__label__anger Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
__label__disgust Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
__label__neutral anyway, his name is Allan and weve been going out for three years.
__label__neutral He was my first client when I became a party planner.
__label__neutral He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time.
__label__neutral Oh well.
__label__neutral And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
__label__joy Oh. Oh, thats great!
__label__neutral Oh, youre one of
__label__surprise Really? Like how?
__label__neutral Well yknow, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, wed jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so theyd put salt on their cereal.
__label__joy Thats a good one.
__label__surprise Yeah? You like that one?
__label__joy Yeah, youre funny.
__label__surprise Im funny?
__label__joy Oh thank God!
__label__joy Well hey, Ive got a ton of these!
__label__neutral Umm, oh hereDo you want a good one?
__label__neutral Heres a good one.
__label__neutral Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge.
__label__neutral Right?
__label__neutral And then you say to person, I bet you cant roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face.
__label__neutral And then when they do it, theyre left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
__label__neutral Can I do it to you?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I-I-I-Im funny Ben, but Im not stupid. Okay?
__label__neutral Chloe? Hi..
__label__non-neutral Is this about me taking your watch?
__label__surprise You took my watch?
__label__sadness Im sorry, I do that.
__label__non-neutral Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
__label__neutral Oh no. I feel it isnt really anybodys business, y'know.
__label__neutral Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
__label__neutral Yeah. That-that was the problem.
__label__joy Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!!
__label__joy Bing! You got those numbers for me?
__label__neutral So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
__label__neutral Umm. Well, theres Rachel, and umm, I think thats it. How bout you?
__label__neutral Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know.
__label__neutral I see Spindler a lot.
__label__neutral Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time.
__label__neutral Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
__label__neutral Is that all?
__label__joy Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
__label__surprise Ohh, how is he?
__label__neutral Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
__label__neutral Isnt he an architect now?
__label__neutral Yeah, they still wear underwear.
__label__neutral So the Porsche guy took his car back.
__label__neutral But you found the keys to his clothes?
__label__non-neutral No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
__label__surprise And people will think you own a Porsche because youre wearing the clothes?
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
__label__joy Great!
__label__neutral Okay, London 1
__label__neutral Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__surprise Oh! Its you.  Hi.
__label__anger What about me?! You-you just said I could!
__label__neutral Im not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
__label__non-neutral I cant believe youre not picking me.

__label__non-neutral Yes!  Shame about you man.
__label__joy Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
__label__sadness Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
__label__surprise Wh-what?! Why?!
__label__sadness It's a money thing, we don't have any.
__label__surprise You're kidding right?
__label__neutral No.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
__label__non-neutral Uh, hang out?! How long?
__label__neutral I don't know.
__label__non-neutral A week?
__label__neutral Maybe two?
__label__neutral The money will turn up!
__label__neutral People will always wanna invest in movies!
__label__neutral Hey, you're not rich are ya?
__label__anger No!

__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral These got left for ya.
__label__non-neutral Thanks.   Congratulations on your big break.
__label__neutral Rachel, do you have any muffins left?

__label__neutral Hey.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral So how was Joan?
__label__neutral I broke up with her.
__label__surprise Dont tell me, because of the big nostril thing?
__label__disgust They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
__label__neutral Come on, they were not that huge.
__label__disgust I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain.
__label__surprise How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
__label__neutral Hold it, hold it.
__label__neutral I gotta side with Chandler on this one.
__label__disgust When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple.
__label__disgust It made me nuts.
__label__neutral You or me?
__label__non-neutral I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
__label__surprise You guys are messing with me, right?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
