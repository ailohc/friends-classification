neutral	You mustve had your hands full.
neutral	That I did. That I did.
neutral	So lets talk a little bit about your duties.
surprise	My duties?  All right.
neutral	Now youll be heading a whole division, so youll have a lot of duties.
neutral	I see.
neutral	But therell be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.
neutral	Good to know.
neutral	We can go into detail
fear	No dont I beg of you!
neutral	All right then, well have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, youll fit in well here.
surprise	Really?!
neutral	Absolutely.  You can relax; you did great.
surprise	But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
non-neutral	You know? Forget it!

surprise	Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
surprise	What, what, what?!
surprise	What?!
neutral	He was with her when he wrote this poem.
neutral	Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside.
neutral	Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'
surprise	He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
non-neutral	You really think that is what he meant?
sadness	Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
neutral	Done.
non-neutral	Hey!

non-neutral	I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
anger	You fell asleep!!
anger	There was no kangaroo!
non-neutral	They didnt take any of my suggestions!
neutral	Thats for coming buddy.

neutral	Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
neutral	Great, I'll see you then.
joy	Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
neutral	Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."
neutral	I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
disgust	Oh my god. You are pure evil.
non-neutral	Ok, pure evil , horny and alone . I've done this
anger	Nobody!

neutral	Nothing!
fear	Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.
neutral	But um, I dont think its anything serious.
surprise	This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor!
fear	No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
non-neutral	Thats a hernia.

sadness	Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
non-neutral	I knew that was him!
sadness	Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
neutral	Hey, you ok?
sadness	I guess.
neutral	There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey.
neutral	I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else.
neutral	Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
neutral	Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.

non-neutral	Oy!!
surprise	Whats with all this sand?
neutral	Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
neutral	Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
anger	Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
joy	Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.

neutral	Yeah, that really calms me down.
non-neutral	And!
joy	We have so much in common!
non-neutral	She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if we were ever to have kids, well thats a
surprise	Oh my God! Listen to you talkin about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please dont get married before I do.
neutral	Okay.
surprise	How does she do that?

non-neutral	Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
surprise	Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
neutral	It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
surprise	What's going on with you?
anger	I got no sleep last night!
neutral	Why?
disgust	My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed.
neutral	Oh, and deaf.
neutral	So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time.
disgust	You have no idea how loud they are!
neutral	Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
joy	Thanks.
disgust	Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
neutral	It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
surprise	Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
neutral	Breathe, breathe, breathe.
surprise	Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually going to kill you dead.
non-neutral	Okay! You dont think I thought of that?
surprise	How can you not know which one?
non-neutral	I mean thats unbelievable.
neutral	I mean, was it Gina?
neutral	Which one is Gina?
neutral	Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
neutral	No, no, no, thats Dina.
surprise	You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!!
neutral	I dont know, you thought See you Saturday was funny.
neutral	Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with.
neutral	You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
joy	Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
surprise	Really!?
neutral	Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out.
neutral	I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
joy	Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What?

surprise	Really?
neutral	: Yeah, you could dance real good with her, shes the same size as me.
neutral	No, Im good.
non-neutral	Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
neutral	Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so
surprise	Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
neutral	Who knows?
neutral	Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
joy	Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!
joy	Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
joy	Yeah!
neutral	Actually, that can't happen.
neutral	Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
neutral	So it'll be either you two  or you two.
non-neutral	Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
neutral	Yeah, it is.
neutral	No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
non-neutral	Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
joy	Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
non-neutral	Please!
non-neutral	Are you kidding?
non-neutral	I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody noseI mean I-Im not proud of it but, I really am.
joy	And its all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
fear	I think youve got concussion.
joy	No, no, Im serious. Thank you.
fear	Youre welcome.  Im sorry. Did I hurt you?
non-neutral	Its worth the pain.  Yknow what, you know what? Its not.
surprise	Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
non-neutral	I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do"  "I do".
neutral	Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
joy	David is going to propose to Phoebe.
surprise	What?  Why?
non-neutral	Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
anger	Chandler, we have talked about this.
anger	You are not supposed to give people advice!
non-neutral	Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
neutral	I
anger	They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!
non-neutral	She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone
non-neutral	Man, that's some
neutral	Oh, that's not what you want...
neutral	This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
joy	It-its great to meet you Paul.
neutral	I usually prefer Elizabeths boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
neutral	Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
anger	So Ross, what your problem?
surprise	Eh-whExcuse me?
anger	Why cant you get a girlfriend your own age?
fear	Thats funny. Umm.  Its not funny.
neutral	I
neutral	Okay.
neutral	I can, I can see that.
fear	Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	What?
anger	Okay. Ill give you one chance to change my mind.  You got one minute.
surprise	Daddy!
neutral	Oh well, its not on TV yet.
neutral	Well, then its not on the wall yet.
neutral	Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
neutral	So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauers clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that havent been cleaned yet?
surprise	Ooooohh!
neutral	Oh yeah, I'm sure.  And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
surprise	Was it...?
neutral	Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
surprise	"Ooo," what?
neutral	Uma Thurman.
surprise	Oh!
surprise	The actress!
neutral	Thanks Rach.
surprise	So what are you gonna do?
joy	You have to tell her!
joy	You have to tell her!

non-neutral	Guys?
non-neutral	Guys?
neutral	Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
neutral	Feminist issue. That's where I went!

neutral	Yeah, well...

neutral	Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
neutral	No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
neutral	Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
neutral	Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
surprise	What?! You totally get embarrassed!
neutral	No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
neutral	Is that so?
neutral	Yeah.
disgust	Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am
surprise	I cant believe it!
joy	I did it!
joy	I rode a bike!
joy	I never thought Id be able to do that!
joy	Thank you Ross.
joy	Oh hey, dont thank me, thank yourself. Youre the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
non-neutral	Well yeah, but then
non-neutral	YeahNo-but-but-but-but! Were just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, thats not scary right?
neutral	Depends on what you mean by we.

joy	Wow, you look unbelievable.
surprise	Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
non-neutral	Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.
surprise	What happened?
neutral	Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
neutral	Yeah?
sadness	Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.
joy	Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
non-neutral	Good, good, life is good...
joy	Good!
non-neutral	Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
neutral	Oh, good for you.
non-neutral	She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that".
sadness	Mike and I broke up.
sadness	It means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us.
surprise	Oh my God!
sadness	I'm sorry.
sadness	I'm sorry too.
non-neutral	Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
non-neutral	I know.

surprise	Huh?
anger	Because I sure as hell cant figure it out!
non-neutral	I talk to you and nothin.
non-neutral	You look at me, and its nothin.
non-neutral	Nothing.
joy	Tasty! Im really starting to feel like you guys have a history, its-its nice.
neutral	I have a question about this scene.
neutral	Yes?
non-neutral	Well, I dont understand why Adriennes attracted to Victor.
neutral	Peel the onion. First of all, hes good looking.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	I think my characters gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
neutral	Oh, hey, how about this one.
non-neutral	Ah, its says so in the script!
non-neutral	Y'know ah, I-I dont know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that youre a bitch.
anger	It doesnt say that in the script.
non-neutral	It does in mine!
non-neutral	I cant
non-neutral	Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
neutral	Yknow who has a great video camera?
neutral	Greg and Jenny?
neutral	Do you still wanna call em? I wanna call em.
neutral	Lets call em.
joy	Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!

non-neutral	Uh sorry, wrong number.
neutral	Here you go.
surprise	Hello?   Its the deli again!
joy	All right! Ill have a sandwich!
non-neutral	I dont think this numbers right!
non-neutral	Oh come on!!
sadness	Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
surprise	Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?
neutral	Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
neutral	Sure. So how long you been...
neutral	Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
surprise	Since then?!
neutral	No, it's only been six years.
neutral	I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy.
neutral	...Joe.
neutral	Y'ever been in love?
neutral	...I d'know.
neutral	Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
disgust	You're one to talk.
neutral	Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
non-neutral	Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
surprise	Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
neutral	Everythings gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
surprise	Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  Thats supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
neutral	Hey, Rach, how was work?
neutral	Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasnt a chair.
neutral	By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
neutral	Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming.
neutral	Im just gonna throw it out, its probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
neutral	Something wrong?
neutral	No. Nothing.
neutral	And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
surprise	Yeah, that's it?
neutral	Yeah.
joy	Yess!!
joy	We're teeth people Zack!
sadness	Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
non-neutral	No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name!
neutral	Its not that bad.
non-neutral	Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
neutral	So, youre just Bing?
joy	Because we won our apartment back!
surprise	What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
non-neutral	No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
surprise	I dont know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it!  Ah-ha!
neutral	All right, cut, lets pick again, pick again.
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	Come on apartment! Come on apartment!  Oh! I know queen is high!

surprise	Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
non-neutral	No they didnt!
neutral	You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
neutral	It's gonna be worth it.
neutral	It's a known fact that women love babies, all right?
neutral	Women love guys who love babies.
neutral	It's that whole sensitive thing.
neutral	Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there.
neutral	Maybe one of them will break away.
non-neutral	No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left.
neutral	All right, gimme the baby.

neutral	You wanna smell him?
joy	Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
non-neutral	What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
neutral	Well, we are great guys.
neutral	Bye.
neutral	Well, not really.
neutral	I mean technically its-its not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.
non-neutral	Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
non-neutral	Well Ross, you be careful now. You dont want to get a reputation as yknow Professor McNailshisstudents.
non-neutral	Yeah. What-what should I do?

anger	For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
anger	You had no
anger	Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
anger	But I told you, I didnt have the time!
anger	Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
anger	Wh, Ross what do you want from me?
anger	You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
neutral	I know.
non-neutral	Ooh, I have to tell you something.
neutral	What?
neutral	But I cant tell you.
neutral	Okay, but wouldnt it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
neutral	Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldnt tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
neutral	Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
neutral	No.
neutral	Does it have to do with Joey?
neutral	No.
neutral	Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
neutral	No, but lets come back to that later!
joy	Hi!
joy	Richard!
neutral	Actually, Im not here to complement the chef.
neutral	Ohh Oh, thats okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef.
neutral	Like I have nothing better to do!
neutral	So whats up?
joy	Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
neutral	Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
joy	No! I came here to tell you something else.  I came here  to tell you I still love you.
non-neutral	One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
non-neutral	So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
anger	Maybe!  Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it! I cant!
fear	Joey, I am scared to death about this.
fear	But I really think I can do it, Im just gonna need some help.
neutral	And Bobbys gonna be here the whole time.
joy	You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, were straight-up gangster rap.
anger	Look, Rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her. Why cant you do that for me?
non-neutral	Because! Cause Cause youre my baby sister!
joy	And youre my big brother!
neutral	I mean, youre my favorite guy in the whole world.
neutral	Im not even scared to tell mom and dad.
fear	I was scared of telling you.
non-neutral	Well Id be scared of them, but all right.
sadness	Joey, I cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.
sadness	I want him to have his uncle.
sadness	Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
joy	Of course hes gonna have his Uncle Joey!
joy	Were gonna be all right. I mean, even if were not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
joy	Thats right! By his uncle too!
joy	And by you.
neutral	Okay Bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have a little moment.
non-neutral	Come here!
non-neutral	No! Seriously! Whats wrong with you?!
joy	I had a really nice time tonight.

neutral	Uh-huh.
non-neutral	That sounds great!
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You cant eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
surprise	Theres gravy?
neutral	If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time.
neutral	That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, thats your department now.
neutral	What are you doing?
neutral	I think I left a donut up here.
neutral	So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so Im happy.

sadness	Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!

non-neutral	Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?
joy	Yeah!
neutral	Oh then you know each other.
neutral	Were on a semi-first name basis.
neutral	What do you think of adding him to our team?
non-neutral	Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know if he has what it takes.
surprise	Really? They love him down on six.
neutral	But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here.
joy	Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
neutral	A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
joy	No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans tux!
surprise	What?
joy	Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat Batman film he was in.
anger	You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James Bonds tux!
neutral	So?
sadness	SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.
non-neutral	Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say "I do," hes thinking, "Yeah, Id do her too!"
neutral	Well then we still have a problem.
neutral	Yeah!
neutral	With what?
neutral	Well, were trying to find someone to perform our wedding and theyre all either boring or annoying or yknow, cant stop staring at the ladies.
joy	Oo! You should have one of us do it!
neutral	Phoebe, were getting

surprise	Are you serious?
joy	Yes! A friend of mine did it and its totally legal!
joy	I call it!!
anger	What?! No! It was my idea!
neutral	Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
anger	Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
neutral	We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
joy	See, I see.... big passion in your future.
surprise	Really?
neutral	I do.
joy	Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
non-neutral	It's never gonna happen.
non-neutral	Everybody knows!
neutral	That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why.
neutral	Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldnt sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
neutral	Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
neutral	Yeah, I wouldve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
surprise	What?!?!
neutral	Okay, this is what Im talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
neutral	You can spill. In the sink.
sadness	Aw, honey its not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I dont see that happening.
joy	I love you, too.
non-neutral	Aww, good.  What?
sadness	What? Im just said.
neutral	No youre not, youre wondering which cushion it is.
surprise	Oh my God! Are you serious?!
neutral	Uh-huh.
joy	I would love to live with you Ross; thats-thats great! Thank you!
neutral	Well, Im-Im just glad I could, yknow, help you out.
non-neutral	Wow! Im-Im so happy for you guys.  This is so-so, not stupid.
joy	Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me!
sadness	I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.
joy	You just saved me!
joy	Youre my hero!
neutral	Hero, I uh, I dont knowwell, all right.
joy	Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
non-neutral	Oh please!   Youre gonna say things now, arent ya?
neutral	No.
neutral	No, I wont.
neutral	But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise.
non-neutral	She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!
non-neutral	And thats how she ended up living with me!
neutral	Okay, thats a lie.
disgust	Ugh!!
neutral	What happened?
neutral	I ended up at Ross's place.
neutral	Oh, I musta missed counted or something.
anger	Damn!
non-neutral	She's not there anymore.
neutral	Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
neutral	No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
non-neutral	...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?
joy	Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
neutral	Lose the robe.
surprise	Me?
joy	That's great.
neutral	Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
neutral	No, no, I'm still working on mine.
surprise	That's it?
non-neutral	Yeah, it was really hard.
neutral	Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
non-neutral	Ok, you weren't there.
joy	Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice!
neutral	Pretty nice?
neutral	Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
neutral	We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weve got a canoe.
neutral	Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe.
non-neutral	You gotta take the canoe!
neutral	All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
anger	Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
non-neutral	Good for you!!
neutral	Pheebs?
neutral	Yeah?
neutral	Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
surprise	One ticket to Yemen?
neutral	Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
surprise	Im sorry sir, I dont understand.
neutral	What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
neutral	Are you travelling with a child?
neutral	No.
neutral	All right, yknow what, shes  gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card.
non-neutral	Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we dont take library cards.
non-neutral	Whats the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
neutral	Okay, but this is the last time.
joy	With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there.
joy	Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hows she doing?
surprise	She?
non-neutral	Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she?
neutral	I dont know.  I cant tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
neutral	Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
non-neutral	Excuse me?
neutral	What?
non-neutral	Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
neutral	Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
neutral	Well sensitive is important, pick him.
neutral	Yeah.
disgust	Oh sure, go with the sissy.
anger	Jason is not a sissy!
non-neutral	Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesnt matter.
neutral	I mean, I think it wouldve happened either way.
neutral	I mean if you hadnt initiated it I-I-I know I wouldve.
joy	It was an amazing night.
joy	It was. It was an amazing night.
non-neutral	You think it looked amazing?
neutral	Do we have a name yet?
neutral	No, not yet.
neutral	Thats fine, for now well just call her Baby Girl Green.
neutral	Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
joy	Hello baby girl.
non-neutral	Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
non-neutral	I dont like sitting up here! Im just gonna over
non-neutral	No Rachel! They got here first!
neutral	Why is Ross doing that?
fear	DANGER
surprise	Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
neutral	No thats all right. Dont worry about it.
disgust	Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain!
non-neutral	Rach! Hey! Its fine! Youre at Joeys!
surprise	Really?
neutral	Yeah! Look!
non-neutral	Ive never lived like this before.
neutral	I know.
neutral	All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food.
neutral	Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
joy	I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen    Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
surprise	Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support    you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so
neutral	Also so
neutral	Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
neutral	Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff!
neutral	OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
neutral	About what?
neutral	He's planning your birthday party.
joy	Oh my God! I love him!
fear	You'd better act surprised.
neutral	About what?
joy	My surprise party!
surprise	What surprise party?
non-neutral	Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
neutral	Well, he didn't tell me.
neutral	Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
anger	This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
neutral	No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
anger	Yuh-huh!
non-neutral	I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.
non-neutral	I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.
surprise	Looks like I was second to last.
neutral	Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad.
neutral	Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an invitation.
anger	Chandler! Hes your father; he should be at the wedding.
disgust	I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I havent seen him in years.
non-neutral	Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!
non-neutral	Well he doesnt have to know!
neutral	Its not like we run in the same circles.
disgust	I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
neutral	Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
non-neutral	Trust me, you dont want him there either.
neutral	Okay?
disgust	Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
neutral	So what! As long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil I dont care.
neutral	Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
neutral	Hello! Whos in there?
neutral	How ya doin?
non-neutral	Who in the hell are you?
neutral	I guess you wouldnt believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
fear	No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us!
non-neutral	No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
non-neutral	Im not gonna marry Chandler!
anger	Not after this!
neutral	Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo.
neutral	I gotta go.
non-neutral	Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
neutral	Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	So Pheebs, what is the book about?
neutral	I thought you said you read it in high school.
neutral	Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm, what is this book about?
neutral	Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?
neutral	Y'know what, actually  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
non-neutral	I thought you didn't smoke.
neutral	Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?
neutral	Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?
surprise	And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!"
neutral	But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
neutral	We get high.
neutral	Oh, me too.
neutral	I'm kidding.
non-neutral	Oh, me too.
non-neutral	Oh, are you sure you're ok?
neutral	Yeah.
sadness	Does it still hurt?
sadness	Yeah.
non-neutral	What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Hey, how'd it go?
joy	Excellent.
joy	We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
non-neutral	What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
neutral	You know what? You are right. I
joy	Good for you Pheebs!
neutral	Ok.
neutral	Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean
anger	This sucks! I didnt know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! Im so tired!
neutral	Its 6:00.
neutral	Yeah, well
joy	Hi!
non-neutral	Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think thats, I think thats really cool.
neutral	Yeah, Rach, I think youre handling that really well.
neutral	Handling it?
non-neutral	What do you mean, handling it?
non-neutral	Theres nothing to handle.
neutral	Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasnt for me and Joshua.
anger	Yknow, theyre not gonna get married anyway!
surprise	What?
non-neutral	Come on!
disgust	They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous!
non-neutral	I mean, theyre gonna be engaged for like what?
non-neutral	A year?
neutral	And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what theyve done and theyre call the whole thing off.
joy	Im telling ya, youre gonna be dancing at my wedding before youre dancing at theres.
surprise	What the hell is this?!
anger	What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I cant use for another two months?!
anger	This sucks!
neutral	All right, whats my next present?
non-neutral	!
neutral	All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
neutral	Ennnh.
neutral	Ive got canned goods.

neutral	Excellent hole, Joe.
surprise	Oh no! No!! My hole!!
non-neutral	Ow!! Ow!!!
surprise	What?! What?!! What is it?!
neutral	My drinking?
neutral	Oh, I mustve said that after you left.
non-neutral	Said what? Exactly.
neutral	That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge.
disgust	Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible person!
fear	Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!!
anger	If youre gonna get all sensitive about it!
sadness	I dont want to lose you.
neutral	What if I, create a position for you?
neutral	Ill make you an assistant buyer in this department.
joy	Say more things like that.
non-neutral	You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
neutral	Id need an expense account.
joy	Done!
neutral	And an assistant.
joy	Sophie, get in here!
joy	Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
surprise	Oh my!
neutral	They're male nurses.
neutral	Not in my head.
joy	Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
non-neutral	Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
surprise	What?
surprise	What are you talking about?!
non-neutral	You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.
neutral	I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me.
neutral	Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
neutral	Umm, why don't you give
surprise	What?
neutral	Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?

neutral	Thank you.
neutral	Okay. Lets bring it in.
neutral	Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
neutral	Here you go.
anger	That almost hit me in the face.
non-neutral	A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so cliché. Why don't you get a magician?!
neutral	Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
joy	Hey!
joy	Hey!
joy	Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
joy	Oh boy, me too!
neutral	Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
non-neutral	Yeah?
neutral	Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
non-neutral	The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
joy	Thats me! Come on!
neutral	Okay.  But wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch.
neutral	Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
non-neutral	Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
neutral	I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
joy	Hi! Nice to meet you!
neutral	Nice to meet you too.
neutral	So, are you ready to go?
neutral	Yeah.
non-neutral	Chandler!
neutral	Ill be right with you.
neutral	Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple.
neutral	Y'know?
neutral	Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.
neutral	Y'know?
neutral	You can take it off.
non-neutral	Just slice that baby right off!
neutral	Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing?
neutral	Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
neutral	Well that's not a third nipple.
surprise	No?
neutral	First of all, it's on your ass.
surprise	Well then, what is it?!
neutral	Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
neutral	I'm with Hamilton!
neutral	He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
non-neutral	Umm, this is great wine.
neutral	Its from FranceIn EuropeWestern Europe. Yknow umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
surprise	Really?
joy	Uh-hmmWait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
neutral	I studied for a year in Barcelona.
neutral	Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking

non-neutral	Oh we-we didnt.

neutral	Um uhWere-were just having this baby together but uh, uh thats all.
surprise	Why?!!
neutral	Uh well ummwere just not in that place, yknow? But were very excited about this.
neutral	Oh. Well then shut me up.
neutral	Just tell me how.
non-neutral	Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.
non-neutral	Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
neutral	Let it go, Ross.
neutral	Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
neutral	Do you all promise?
non-neutral	Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!

neutral	Yeah? The work problem?
joy	Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
neutral	What problem did you tell him you had?
neutral	Oh thats not important. The point is, I reallyI think everythings gonna be okay.
neutral	Okay, Ive got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
disgust	No thanks, Mom!
non-neutral	Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, cause Im pregnant.
non-neutral	Ha-ha, its not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
joy	Very good,  so good.
joy	I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
sadness	Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didnt call.
non-neutral	I mean youd think hed be worried about me not showing up at his club.
non-neutral	Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
non-neutral	Come on! Look where you are!!
neutral	When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
neutral	Remember, a virgin for me please.
neutral	Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
neutral	Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy.
neutral	Well, if you think it will help.
anger	No!
non-neutral	That was a test!
non-neutral	In a couple of hours Im gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me!
non-neutral	And then after that, Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice
non-neutral	You should! How is she?
anger	Ohhh!!
joy	I think somebody needs another lap dance.
neutral	All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
surprise	You do?
surprise	You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman.
non-neutral	That and arrogance.
neutral	Hey.
joy	Hey! How was sailing?
joy	Wow thanks!
non-neutral	Joe?
joy	Yeah!
neutral	Uh, youve had a lot of sex right?
surprise	When? Today? Some, not a lot.
fear	Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt.
fear	There huhhmm, there-there was an incident.
neutral	Dont worry about that man, that happens.
surprise	Its happened to you?
neutral	Yeah! Once.
surprise	Well, whatd you do?
neutral	I did it anyway.
neutral	Sup? Sup dude?
fear	Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me.
neutral	So youre playing a little
disgust	Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
surprise	Come on man, really how old?!
disgust	Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
surprise	And they knew about it?
surprise	Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
anger	Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
anger	Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just dont know what the big deal is!
non-neutral	The big deal is I dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! Cold beer.
neutral	Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
non-neutral	Do you always have to bring him here?
neutral	I didn't wanna leave him alone.
neutral	Alright?
neutral	We- we had our first fight this morning.
neutral	I think it has to do with my working late.
neutral	I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
neutral	Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
joy	Oh, that'd be great!
neutral	Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
neutral	Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
neutral	All right, check it out.
neutral	Check this out.
non-neutral	It says here that theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!
neutral	"Its almost as good as being there."
joy	Its better! You cant go to a museum in your underwear!
joy	Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
neutral	Uh, may I help you?
neutral	Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, Im the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
neutral	Look, its like I told you, theres nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
neutral	All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
anger	Nobody sees the king!

surprise	Oh my God.
neutral	So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh?
neutral	I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore.
sadness	Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a
surprise	Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
neutral	I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
non-neutral	No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says hes gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
non-neutral	Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea.
neutral	Oh. Look, just friends, I wont grope you. I promise.
non-neutral	No, I just I think that its too soon.
neutral	No its not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
neutral	I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
surprise	And now you want that money back.
neutral	Exactly.
non-neutral	Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
non-neutral	Its not a real game! I made it up!
non-neutral	Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
neutral	I don't know.
neutral	But I can see through your sheet.
neutral	Yeah, yeah, that's her.
neutral	But y'know what?
sadness	Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
neutral	Why?
sadness	Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
surprise	What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
non-neutral	No. No. No. She lives on the
neutral	No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby.
neutral	And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway.
neutral	You've been counting wrong.
non-neutral	I did
non-neutral	Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this.
non-neutral	Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
surprise	Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
neutral	No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
non-neutral	All right, lets do it.
joy	Come on!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	All right, gentlemen, youre up first.
neutral	Okay.

neutral	Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
neutral	Weekend at Bernies
neutral	Well, look, why dont you just, why dont you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
joy	Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
non-neutral	No you cant.
non-neutral	Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
non-neutral	You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long.
anger	Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
neutral	Okay.
sadness	Im sorry.
surprise	And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio.
fear	You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
neutral	Well, that shouldnt be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
neutral	Pete, can I get you something else?
neutral	Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if youre given em out.
neutral	Havent you and I covered that topic?
neutral	Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you.
non-neutral	Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
non-neutral	Well, if that were true, Id dating my Aunt Ruth.
disgust	And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.
neutral	Come on, you think she should go out with me, dont you?
non-neutral	Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?
disgust	I mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean.
disgust	That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
neutral	I mean really, think about it.
neutral	Ho-ho, I will.
surprise	I believe I read that somewhere!
anger	That only is not funny, it's physically impossible!
non-neutral	Ok?
non-neutral	Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...
anger	It's not funny!
anger	!
neutral	I respectfully disagree.
anger	I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
neutral	Who cares? Nobody reads those things
non-neutral	You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.
neutral	I don't have a page.
non-neutral	Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
non-neutral	I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
surprise	Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
non-neutral	No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
disgust	So, rocks.
sadness	I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
joy	Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?
joy	I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
surprise	Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
sadness	Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
neutral	You
neutral	Why?
joy	Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop.  Get up! Get up! Get up!
non-neutral	I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you dont think your son will think its yours and be horribly traumatised?

neutral	Ohh, its time to go.
non-neutral	Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clocks a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes.
neutral	Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes?

neutral	Man, I wish I was naked.
joy	I mean, this-this looks so great.
neutral	That is how God intended it.

non-neutral	Okay, you go!
surprise	My turn? What-what are you talking about?
disgust	Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.

neutral	Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Bigot.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Mr. Bigot. He tells the most
non-neutral	All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
surprise	Me and Chandler?!

neutral	Okay Ive got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?

surprise	Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? Im sorry.
neutral	Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
neutral	I think its best sir.
neutral	But we really do need to find someone up here.
neutral	The work is starting to pile up.
neutral	Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high.

surprise	Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
anger	Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!
disgust	Great, now he's waving back.

non-neutral	It creeps me out!
anger	I feel like I can't do stuff!
non-neutral	What kinda stuff?
disgust	Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
surprise	You cook naked?
neutral	Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
surprise	What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
neutral	Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
non-neutral	Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt called. Not that I even care, y'know.
neutral	Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to.
anger	You think you know me so well.
neutral	Well, dont cha wanna?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Okay, well I do know you.
neutral	Thats what I said.
neutral	Well so?
sadness	I cant.
sadness	I cant.
sadness	She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone.
sadness	Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like all my lives.
neutral	Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
neutral	Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
neutral	It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
joy	It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
non-neutral	Nuh-uh.
non-neutral	Yuh-huh.
surprise	So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?

non-neutral	Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
non-neutral	Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my

neutral	That's the rule.
anger	What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
non-neutral	How'd you get to that?
non-neutral	Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
surprise	You knew about that?
disgust	Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
neutral	Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
non-neutral	What do you mean, like, buy it together?
neutral	Yeah
non-neutral	You think we're ready for something like that?
neutral	Why not?
neutral	Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
non-neutral	Why, are you moving out?
neutral	I'm not moving out.
fear	You'd tell me if you were moving out right
neutral	Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
non-neutral	Aw, I know all about Kip!
non-neutral	It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
non-neutral	Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
non-neutral	Aw, don't do that
non-neutral	Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
neutral	Oh no, stay here well keep doing this. Ill pay you.

joy	Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss.
non-neutral	Oh my God! Oh my God! Im so sorry!
neutral	Aw forget it, its from
anger	You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! Im gonna kill you!!
sadness	Yknow this is actually not a great time for me.
joy	Okay! So, well just stay married.
joy	Yes, exactly!
joy	And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
non-neutral	Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Id have to talk you into this more.
fear	Okay, see now Im scared because I dont actually think youre kidding.
non-neutral	Im-Im not kidding. Look I-I, I cant have
surprise	What-wh-what so well just stay married forever?!
neutral	Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you?
non-neutral	Really?
joy	I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.!
neutral	Its
sadness	Ohh, okay, Im sorry.
neutral	Youre right.
neutral	Yknow what?
non-neutral	We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far
neutral	Im asking you to do me a favor.
non-neutral	You are asking me to be your wife!
neutral	And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
surprise	Oh my God!
non-neutral	I know, I know, I'm such an idiot.
non-neutral	I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week.
non-neutral	I mean, how clean can teeth get?
neutral	My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
neutral	Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
neutral	-leg?

surprise	You actually broke her watch?
surprise	Ooh, steer clear of you.
neutral	That's right.
sadness	Barry, I'm sorry...
sadness	I am so sorry...

sadness	Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him.
anger	Go!
surprise	What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
anger	I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wont quit.
neutral	I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
surprise	Oh God Oh, hes in there right now?
neutral	Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?

surprise	You don't trust him?
neutral	I think the check in is that way.
neutral	Ahh.
neutral	Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
non-neutral	Well theres some people who do want to marry me.
surprise	There are?
non-neutral	Yeah! Richard!
surprise	R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?!
neutral	Thats right.
neutral	Chandler

non-neutral	That-that hes a-a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife!
non-neutral	That-that hes against marriage and always will be!

neutral	I knew.
surprise	You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
neutral	I did.
sadness	Oh.
fear	Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?
neutral	Sometime?
neutral	Maybe?
non-neutral	Yeah, maybe...
joy	Okay... okay, maybe I will...
surprise	Why?
neutral	Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
joy	Well, youre amazing.
neutral	Oh no-no-no.
surprise	A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
non-neutral	Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account.

joy	You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that.
neutral	You mean with Casey.
neutral	No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes pretty cool.
neutral	Or Casey.
neutral	No-no, Kathy.
neutral	Could be Casey.
neutral	No. No, Kathy.
neutral	Consider Casey.
non-neutral	Yknow what I think?
joy	I think somebodys got a little crush on Casey.
non-neutral	How bout I fix you two up?
non-neutral	What do you think?
joy	That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
neutral	Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
neutral	Honey, whats the matter?
neutral	I just saw Janice.
non-neutral	Cause every time I see your face, I cant help but fall from grace. I know.....
non-neutral	Wow! This girl is good.
non-neutral	Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
neutral	I like her.
neutral	Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
neutral	Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from these people.
non-neutral	Look at you. All jealous.
neutral	Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, shes more.. y'know, and youre more

neutral	No,
surprise	What?! What else did he say?
neutral	Umm, he said he thought I was funny.
neutral	So Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
non-neutral	Ross, no! There is
neutral	Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
non-neutral	Ross, I am a human doodle!!
neutral	Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun!
neutral	Okay?
neutral	And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna
neutral	Okay, there was
non-neutral	Come on!
non-neutral	Oh wait, dont you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies?

neutral	You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
non-neutral	So?!
surprise	Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade?
non-neutral	Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
neutral	Oh right, right.
non-neutral	I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
surprise	Well usually...yeah!
neutral	Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
neutral	Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me.
sadness	Im such a jerk.
neutral	Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
joy	Hmmm... this is so nice.
neutral	OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
neutral	OK.
neutral	OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
surprise	Ohhh!!!!
neutral	Yes, yes, that's right...
surprise	Oh, look at the little cat!
surprise	What?  Ow!

neutral	I didn't mean
non-neutral	Why not?
joy	It's brilliant!
joy	Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!
neutral	well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding...
neutral	Thank you, Chandler.
neutral	Sincerely.
joy	Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
non-neutral	How do you think I should propose?
neutral	David, I'm pretending to

surprise	What?!
joy	Well, you promised me a fun road trip!
anger	Weve been on the road six hours and youve been asleep for five and a half!
non-neutral	We are switching at the next rest stop and
neutral	All right. All right.
non-neutral	Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radios broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
surprise	Really? I dont
anger	Sing!!
non-neutral	Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
joy	Morning!
joy	Everything was delicious!
joy	Thank you!
joy	It was. The duck in particular was superb.
joy	Thank you!    You haven't said anything...
neutral	Actually I do have one small complaint.
neutral	Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
non-neutral	The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind    of a mood-killer!
surprise	What musician?
neutral	We did?
non-neutral	You owe me 20 bucks.
joy	Thank you. Thank you so much!
neutral	Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
surprise	Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?
non-neutral	What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
neutral	All right, I'm nine years old.
non-neutral	Oh, I hate this story.
neutral	We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
sadness	I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
surprise	Oh my god.
sadness	Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
surprise	Hey, who's this little naked guy?
neutral	That little naked guy would be me.
surprise	Aww, look at the little thing.
non-neutral	Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
surprise	Who are those people?
surprise	Got me.
neutral	Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
surprise	Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
neutral	Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
neutral	Looks like a fun gang.
joy	Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
non-neutral	Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
non-neutral	So, whats this about?
neutral	Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
neutral	No.  This is my red sweater.
fear	Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me? Okay.
non-neutral	Whats going on Rach?
non-neutral	Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
non-neutral	Yknow, Im actually glad Phoebe called.
non-neutral	I know we broke up because you thought I wasnt mature enough, but Ive really grown up and think we should get back together.
non-neutral	Oh, its just not the right time.
non-neutral	It is the right time.
neutral	Okay.

surprise	Weirdest thing. Did I hearMother of God its true!
surprise	Chandler Bing!
surprise	Jan-Janice!
non-neutral	Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
neutral	Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.

neutral	Its you. This is yours.
surprise	What?!
joy	Look how nervous he gets! We havent slept together in years!
fear	Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
non-neutral	Man, Im starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
neutral	Yknow, yknow Im lookin and I dont think anyones home here.
neutral	I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and yknow explain later.
surprise	Yeah? Really? No ones home?
neutral	I dont think so. Hello?  When you get in there
neutral	Hey, what's up?
sadness	I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
sadness	Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
anger	Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
anger	You had no relationship!!
anger	No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
anger	Oh God, stop with the plan!
neutral	So what, so what you saw him with a girl?
anger	Who cares?!
anger	That doesn't mean anything!
neutral	Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
non-neutral	She was kinda stupid.
neutral	You're right.
neutral	All right, I'm just gonna go on the date.
neutral	I'm gonna go on the date.
neutral	That is the new plan.
non-neutral	Come on, hurry!

anger	Stupid Jane Rogers!!
surprise	You are having a party tonight??

neutral	I do it every year.
surprise	You do that every year??
anger	I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
non-neutral	Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us??
neutral	Yeah...
non-neutral	And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times    restaurant?
neutral	Yeah...
non-neutral	OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime    tour of that button factory?
surprise	Who's this from?
neutral	Oh, that's Ross's.
surprise	Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered.
neutral	Remembered what?
surprise	It was like months ago.
non-neutral	We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.
surprise	Oh!
surprise	I can't believe he remembered!
surprise	Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
surprise	I can't believe he did this.
neutral	Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
surprise	What did you just say?
fear	F-hah.... flennin....
surprise	Oh.... my God.
joy	I really like waking up with you.

neutral	Oh, that must be it.
neutral	Well I hope you have fun tonight.
joy	Thanks! You too.
neutral	I believe it.
non-neutral	No you dont.
neutral	Yes, I do.
anger	No you doy'know what, youre not gonna suck me into this.
anger	Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
anger	I do not always have to beokay, okay.
neutral	Jurassic Park
fear	I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
neutral	Maybe we should check the trash chute.
neutral	Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
neutral	That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	There he is!
anger	Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!
neutral	Just, y'know out.
non-neutral	Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
neutral	What were you doing?
neutral	I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
non-neutral	You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
non-neutral	He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.

neutral	And how do I know?
neutral	Her dying wish was for one last kiss.
non-neutral	But I dont care,  because you got the apartment.
joy	Yes!
disgust	Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think Im gonna stay here.

non-neutral	I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
surprise	What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
neutral	Okay, well if I was in this for the money, Id be a millionaire by now, y'know.

neutral	Why? Cause otherwise youd go for it?
neutral	Yeah, maybe.
disgust	Oh-oh, you lie.
neutral	What you dont think Id go up to her?
neutral	Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
anger	Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
neutral	You know what honey, you go ahead, well call her an alternate.
neutral	Okay, hold my crawler.
neutral	Okay.
surprise	Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?

joy	Oh thats all right!
joy	Yknow, I ended up having a really good time.
joy	Yknow, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
neutral	So what was it for anyway?
neutral	I wanna say a disease.
surprise	Hey!
surprise	Hey!

neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
anger	No! He blew us off!
surprise	What?!
surprise	I know!
anger	I cant believe it.  Can I tell you something? Im a little mad at him now.
anger	Can I tell you something? Me too.
anger	Yknow what? He didnt want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we dont talk to him
joy	Ooooh! Freeze him out.
joy	Thats right!
joy	I like it!
neutral	Doorknob?
neutral	Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
joy	Oh good.
fear	Look, I  Look, Im having a great time with you and I just dont want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us.
sadness	So, Im sorry I just dont think we should go away together yet.
fear	Its-its too soon.
surprise	Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that Im going to Florida for a couple weeks.
surprise	No. I think you misunderstood what
joy	You are so adorable.

surprise	Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
joy	I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
surprise	But my apartment!
neutral	Was the setting of Phoebes triumph.
non-neutral	But the mess!
neutral	Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
neutral	Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out.
neutral	Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!
neutral	When will that be?
neutral	!
non-neutral	Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
joy	Hey!
joy	Hey Ross! The babys kicking!
surprise	What?! It is?!
non-neutral	Its not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again.
non-neutral	Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
joy	Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joeys room and he was sleeping
neutral	A dreamless sleep.
non-neutral	So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
neutral	Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
neutral	Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	When are you coming home?
surprise	What? Guys, I'm not.
neutral	C'mon, this is us.

neutral	So, um, will you bring the truck?
neutral	I'll even let you ring the bell.
surprise	Oh, my god.
non-neutral	See, there you go, the cleansing works!
neutral	They're nice guys.
joy	Oh, they're firemen guys.
neutral	Your son.
anger	No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
neutral	Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
surprise	What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,
non-neutral	Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
neutral	I got it.
neutral	I got it.
non-neutral	I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
neutral	No, you don't.
anger	All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
surprise	Why?
anger	He started it!
non-neutral	No, you started it.
anger	You did!
anger	I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
neutral	But...
anger	Now go!
non-neutral	Thanks a lot.
non-neutral	See what you did.
neutral	Yeah, listen...
anger	Out
non-neutral	Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say?
neutral	Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
surprise	Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
neutral	Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi.
neutral	Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
neutral	You didnt say Boutros Boutros Gali.
neutral	Boutros Boutros Gali.
neutral	He says he was too.
neutral	Interesting.
neutral	So I was wondering....
non-neutral	Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
joy	Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.
neutral	So you're a chef?
joy	Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
surprise	Oh, really.
non-neutral	Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing?
neutral	Well, I was having a conversation.
anger	Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I havent been able to say two words to each other.
anger	What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
neutral	That would be great. Thank you.
disgust	so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera!
neutral	Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
surprise	When did that happen to you?!
non-neutral	Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera!
disgust	Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
joy	Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it.
non-neutral	Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
neutral	Here, I'll get it.
neutral	We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
joy	Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
non-neutral	Oh, great!
non-neutral	Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!
surprise	That was unbelievable!
non-neutral	Okay, see? I told you!
sadness	Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
non-neutral	I don't believe they're brother and sister.
surprise	They're brother and sister!!!
neutral	Action!
non-neutral	I found the picture!
surprise	What picture?!
non-neutral	The picture of my wife! In your pack!
non-neutral	You went through my personal property?
anger	Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
non-neutral	Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years!
joy	Cut! Wonderful!
joy	Great scene yeah?
joy	Oh youre awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
joy	Thanks a lot.
neutral	Heres your call sheet for tomorrow.
neutral	I know.
joy	So Chandler, your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
neutral	Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
joy	I remember when we first got engaged.
neutral	Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story.
non-neutral	Oh dad, really you dont need to
non-neutral	Well, Id gotten Judy pregnant. I still dont know how that happened.
disgust	You dont know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
neutral	What a sweet story.
disgust	Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
surprise	What?! They wanted a scary story!
joy	Anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.
surprise	What?
fear	You tell her Jack, I cant do it.
surprise	What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund dont you?
non-neutral	We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
neutral	After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
joy	Did that!
neutral	Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
surprise	Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
surprise	Was it not pain-free?
disgust	No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
neutral	Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad.
non-neutral	Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.
neutral	But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest.
surprise	Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
non-neutral	Now, are you glad we didnt start with the bikini strips?
neutral	now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
neutral	I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
neutral	Do you wanna start telling secrets?
non-neutral	No!
neutral	Now umm, remember Im still learning.
neutral	One, two, three, four!
joy	You know the song! Sing along!

neutral	Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
neutral	Yeah.
joy	Yes! Santa's coming!
sadness	Hey, uh, Im really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
neutral	Its no big deal. Hey, yknow, you do what you gotta do. Right?
neutral	But hey, its not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides
non-neutral	Whatever.
non-neutral	Its like that everywhere, Joey!
neutral	Okay, Mon, back me up here.
neutral	Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right?
neutral	And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
sadness	I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
neutral	Look, Ross, really its-its no big deal.
sadness	Yknow you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so be it.
neutral	Yknow, hey I understand.
neutral	Yknow?
neutral	Hey, when Im in a play and youre in the audience, I dont talk to you, right?
neutral	So its yknow, its uh, its cool.
neutral	Ill see you tomorrow.
neutral	Yeah, when were in the audience he doesnt talk to us, but he does wave.
non-neutral	You did look like an idiot.
non-neutral	Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot.
neutral	All right?
non-neutral	Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?"
joy	And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
neutral	Yeah that's the same.
non-neutral	That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
neutral	Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
neutral	Which one?
sadness	Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
non-neutral	Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about.
sadness	Y'know, for me anyway.
sadness	And of course, the Indians.
anger	Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
neutral	Hi, guys.
joy	Hi! Phoebe.
neutral	Hi Phoebe.

neutral	No leg-chewing for us sir.
neutral	Oh well, give it time.
joy	So the divorce, the marriage, weve got a lot to celebrate.
neutral	How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?
non-neutral	I cant think of anything were doing.  Why cant I think of anything were doing?
joy	Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six.
joy	They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
joy	Okay, Ill see you tomorrow!
neutral	Just so you know, were not seeing him tomorrow.
disgust	I-I cannot spend another evening with that man.
disgust	Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?

neutral	I think I need a drink.
non-neutral	Yeah!

anger	No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
sadness	Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again.
neutral	And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.
non-neutral	You really think I'm ready?
joy	Uh-huh!
joy	Wow! Cool!
neutral	Was the chord at least right
non-neutral	No!
neutral	Well, this has been fun.
joy	Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
neutral	Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya.
neutral	Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457.
neutral	And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
neutral	Were beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
joy	Im really glad we came.  Youre so pretty. I love you.
neutral	Okay, thats a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
neutral	Excuse me, Im sorry, Im gonna have to call you back, Ive got a Schemp in my office.

neutral	Im sorry.
neutral	But ah, hey, oh, somebodys off the phone, how bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
neutral	Ross youre not listening to me, I dont have time to stop.
neutral	Come on Rach, you dont have what, ten minutes?
anger	I dont have ten minutes!!
neutral	What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
anger	Hey, Ross!!! I told you I dont!
sadness	Dont yell at me okay, this is the most Ive seen you all week.
neutral	Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, Ive got a deadline, would you just go home, Ill talk to you later.
neutral	Yeah, but wait...
neutral	Good bye!
neutral	Actually, thats our three hole punch.
surprise	Oh yeah? When?
neutral	All right.
neutral	I'll tell you what.
neutral	When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
surprise	Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
neutral	Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
non-neutral	Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
neutral	No, no, no.
non-neutral	What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
neutral	Uh, uh.
surprise	Well?
surprise	Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
neutral	Hey.
surprise	Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
surprise	Did you go home and change?

surprise	Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him?
neutral	Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
neutral	Yeah, why?
neutral	No reason.
joy	I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!
surprise	What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
non-neutral	All right, Ill do it just this once! But you cant tell anybody!
joy	Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
neutral	Yeah, thats her.
neutral	Thank you.
surprise	Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that sign didnt work!
neutral	Yknow what would work?
neutral	Hmm?
anger	Stop making candy!
non-neutral	But they like it!
neutral	You mean they like you.
neutral	Maybe.
surprise	Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
anger	Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
anger	We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled CUT!
surprise	Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
joy	Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
non-neutral	Cos I was gonna say theres no way you couldve done the end the way you guys did it back then!
surprise	What? We could do it!
non-neutral	I dont know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
non-neutral	I can do it, okay? Come on, lets go.
neutral	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
non-neutral	I cant do it!
neutral	Now you do that, youre on TV.
joy	Hey!
neutral	So, what are you guys in the market for? Weve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
neutral	Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. Thats the stuff. What do you think?
neutral	Well, I dont have to buy that, "Im with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
neutral	Well, I like it. Here you go.
non-neutral	All right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you? Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day?
surprise	Oh, I embarrass you?
neutral	How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you?
non-neutral	Hes just jealous. Youll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
neutral	Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
neutral	Theyre all tourists.
disgust	All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
non-neutral	Oh yeah?  If youre gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
non-neutral	Good choice.
non-neutral	Thanks.
anger	Okay, wait. All right, thats it, okay, Im out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
surprise	So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
surprise	What?
anger	Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.
neutral	And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my
surprise	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
anger	You don't even know me...
surprise	Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
surprise	What?
sadness	The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
sadness	I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
neutral	No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
neutral	Oh yeah.
neutral	Okay, forward. ForwardStop!  Okay, backStop!  Okay, forwardStop! Stop! Stop!
neutral	Ross, just forget about it. This guys got you totally wedged in.
neutral	Is this yours?
neutral	Well actually
non-neutral	No-no-no! Its mine! Its-its mine.
neutral	Dude, you soooo need this car.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Okay, heres what were gonna do.
non-neutral	Okay, Im gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral.
neutral	You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.
neutral	Okay?
neutral	All right, here we go.
non-neutral	Haul ass!!!
neutral	!
neutral	So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain.
neutral	So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
joy	...and live forever as a machine!
joy	That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?
neutral	You and I, we're interfacing.
non-neutral	Yeah, I gotta go.
joy	Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
neutral	David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
neutral	Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
neutral	See?
non-neutral	Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
neutral	Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
neutral	Oh, I should go, too.
neutral	Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
non-neutral	Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there.
non-neutral	And she was like "Oh, don't worry!
neutral	I asked him.
non-neutral	He's totally ok with seeing you!".
joy	So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
non-neutral	Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
non-neutral	Exactly!
neutral	And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
non-neutral	I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,
neutral	Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
joy	Ok, that'll be great!
disgust	Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
disgust	That's not what we're gonna do!
disgust	Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
joy	Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
neutral	Hello Skidmark.
neutral	Its a nickname, Ill explain later.
neutral	Its pretty clear.
neutral	Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
surprise	Thats why you broke up with me?
non-neutral	You-you-you didnt know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!
joy	Ni-chou chi-ma!
non-neutral	Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
neutral	Hi everyone.
neutral	I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
non-neutral	Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
neutral	Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
fear	What did, what did he say?
neutral	Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.
neutral	So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so.
neutral	.
neutral	.
joy	Oh, great!
joy	We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
non-neutral	Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly.
joy	All I could think of was yknow, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
neutral	And did he?
joy	Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
neutral	Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
joy	I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks today and Ive only had six.
non-neutral	Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.
sadness	Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I?
disgust	You sound like a guy.
disgust	No, a guy would be saying, "Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."
surprise	Oh my God!
non-neutral	Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!
surprise	Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up!
sadness	I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again.
neutral	Youll have a last kiss.
joy	Thank you so much for coming back over.
non-neutral	Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
neutral	I know Mona, just hear me out.
neutral	First of all, Im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own.
neutral	Youre gonna have to tell me how you did that.
neutral	Focus.
neutral	Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are
neutral	All right wheres that turkey!
surprise	Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
joy	Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
neutral	No.
anger	No!
non-neutral	Yes!
neutral	Ahh.
joy	Oh, would you look at that Monica?
joy	I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
anger	Okay, Im next.  Dont! Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe!
joy	Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.
anger	Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!
neutral	Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
neutral	Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
neutral	Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.
non-neutral	But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
non-neutral	I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!
non-neutral	Or Friday with no two pizzas!
non-neutral	All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over.
joy	No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!
non-neutral	All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
joy	Thats right!
joy	Cause Im a Tribbiani!
neutral	And this is what we do!
non-neutral	I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we dont read a lot or run very fast, but damnit!
joy	We can eat!
neutral	Well?
surprise	Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
joy	Look at this!
surprise	Oh! You have a window!
joy	Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...
surprise	Oh look! That guy's peeing!
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Hi.
non-neutral	Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
neutral	Ohh.
neutral	Okay. Lets use this brush.
neutral	Okay. This stuff?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	All right.
neutral	Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
neutral	Oke-dokey.
neutral	Where exactly is your zoo?
neutral	Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.
neutral	Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
neutral	Yes.
neutral	Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
non-neutral	No-no, he's, he's very docile.
neutral	Even if he were... cornered?
neutral	Well I, I don't know. Why?
neutral	Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
non-neutral	He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
neutral	How about a hammer, or a small blade?
non-neutral	Why- why- why would he need a blade?
non-neutral	Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something.
neutral	Otherwise it's just cruel.

joy	He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
disgust	You're making a big mistake here.
neutral	I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
non-neutral	My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.
joy	Really helped speed the process along!

surprise	Hey! Me too!
non-neutral	All right, stop it. Now youre just doing it to freak me out.

sadness	Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
anger	All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.

surprise	Really?  My God, hes really cute.
neutral	Go for it.
surprise	Phoebe, Im engaged!
neutral	Im just saying, get his number just in case.
neutral	But no: Chandler is in an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
non-neutral	Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, Im engaged.
disgust	Well you should be embarrassed.

neutral	Yknow what?
neutral	Shed-shed love this.
non-neutral	Uh, its an exact replica of Apollo 8.
neutral	I made it in the sixth grade.
neutral	Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
neutral	Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon.
non-neutral	But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
non-neutral	Wait a minute, I cant give this to her.
neutral	Why not?
non-neutral	Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
neutral	Yeah, see ya.
joy	Hey, thank you so much.
non-neutral	Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
neutral	No, just a regular old flying dwarf.

neutral	Now, have you told anyone else?
neutral	No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont want Monica to find out.

disgust	Thats weird!
neutral	Im wearing his briefs right now.
non-neutral	Thatskinda hot.
joy	I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
neutral	Yeah, I wouldnt know about that.
joy	And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
disgust	Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
non-neutral	There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinking even more than you.
disgust	Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.
non-neutral	Im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear!
non-neutral	I dont think you could ever do that.
non-neutral	Hey! I
disgust	Okay, whatever.
neutral	Lusts of the flesh.
neutral	What?

neutral	Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?
neutral	She looks scared.
neutral	Doesn't she  look scared?
neutral	Y'know, I don't really know her.
neutral	Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
neutral	No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
neutral	Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
neutral	Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."
neutral	Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
non-neutral	Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
anger	No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.
non-neutral	The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
non-neutral	Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
neutral	Pathetic mess?
neutral	I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.
joy	I'm thinkin', cha-ching!
neutral	Thanks.
neutral	Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice.

surprise	Really?!
non-neutral	Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
neutral	Oh so-so not really never.
neutral	I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.
neutral	I mean after all weve been through, I justyknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.
neutral	Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
non-neutral	Oh-ho, and mine!
non-neutral	Okay, sono toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
fear	No-no wait-wait! I cant just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
neutral	WellI only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.
non-neutral	Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
sadness	Its just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
neutral	Chandler?
non-neutral	I-Im sorry?
non-neutral	No look, I-Im sure that people know you exist!
non-neutral	Oh yeah?
neutral	I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.
sadness	Ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk.

surprise	I didnt know he could get me fired!
fear	What am I going to do?
neutral	Well yknow Joey, youre a pretty charming guy.
fear	Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
neutral	No sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! Youve got to kiss some serious robot ass!
neutral	Thats not a bad idea.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.
joy	Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
neutral	So do you think uh, Joeys more charming than me?
non-neutral	Yeah! Thats why Im sleeping with him on the side.

non-neutral	Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
surprise	What is this? Fruit?
neutral	Monica's making jam.
joy	Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
neutral	Because the kids need new shoes.
neutral	I'm going into business people.
non-neutral	I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard.
non-neutral	I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.
neutral	What's the opposite of man?
neutral	Jam.
fear	Oh Joey don't!
non-neutral	It's way to hot.
neutral	This will just be my batch.
non-neutral	Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
surprise	Why? Do you think hes still mad at us?
neutral	Well hes probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
surprise	What? Mine arent tinted.
neutral	Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
neutral	I will have one.
neutral	Okay, Im not gonna have one.
neutral	Neither will I.
non-neutral	No, no, its just my tooth.
neutral	All right Ill have one.
neutral	So whats a matter, you need a dentist? Ive got a good one.
fear	No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him.
neutral	See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
surprise	Why? Why cant you go to him?
non-neutral	Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
joy	That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienists blouse.
surprise	Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
non-neutral	Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob.
surprise	And all these people actually died?
non-neutral	Yes, while I was in the chair!
neutral	Thats why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, its not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
neutral	Pheebs, come on, you didnt kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.
neutral	Its, its, its just ah, a coincidence.
non-neutral	Well tell that to them. Oh! You cant, their dead.
surprise	Hello?
neutral	Ross.
non-neutral	Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
sadness	It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
joy	No, no, that-that, thats all right. Umm, Im just glad you called.
non-neutral	Ross umm, theres something that Ive got to tell you, theres-theres someone else.
non-neutral	Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
non-neutral	You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
sadness	Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
neutral	So, let's go.
neutral	Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
neutral	Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.
neutral	You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
neutral	Okay, Ive got three of my five.
neutral	Three of your five, what?
neutral	Celebrities Im allowed to sleep with.
surprise	Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
neutral	Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left.
neutral	All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
joy	Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
surprise	Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
neutral	Susan Sarandon.
disgust	Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
joy	And!! Isabella Rosselini.
joy	Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around.
neutral	So?
neutral	So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time.
neutral	Yeah, cause thats why you wont get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
non-neutral	Oh thats five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesnt she want to come out?
neutral	Yknow what I think it is?
neutral	I think youve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesnt want to leave.
non-neutral	Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
neutral	Twenty-one hours, youre a hero.
non-neutral	Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
neutral	Actually, I think youre ready to go to the delivery room.
surprise	What?
neutral	Ten centimeters, youre about to become a mom.
surprise	My God. Okay.  Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
neutral	Are they here yet?

neutral	Ok.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	May I see your boarding pass?
neutral	Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
neutral	Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
neutral	No, I know, but Ihe just went on.
non-neutral	He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
anger	No no no! Federal regulations!
neutral	OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is
neutral	Alright. What's the message?
neutral	Uh... I don't know.
neutral	Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.

non-neutral	Oh, I don't know, a million?
neutral	Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
neutral	I'm fine.
neutral	All right.
fear	I'm not fine. Here she comes.

neutral	It's like a gift.
neutral	We should always always break up together.
neutral	Oh, I'd like that.
non-neutral	You win.
neutral	Well, what did you have?
non-neutral	It doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six.

surprise	Uh,  wow, 700.
surprise	Not 700 exactly?
neutral	Yeah.
non-neutral	Double it!
surprise	What?
neutral	Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
surprise	Really?
neutral	Hey, I didnt make up the rules.
neutral	Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card.
neutral	Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.
surprise	Dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getNo way!
sadness	Im, Im sorry you didnt get to go to Spacecamp, and Im hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it.

joy	Pheebs, thats great!
joy	Oh, yay!
neutral	But yknow umm, Rachel doesnt rhyme with draddle.
disgust	I know but its so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
neutral	What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
neutral	All good, thanks.  Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname thats easier to rhyme?
neutral	Didnt your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Okay, I can do this.
neutral	I can tell her how I feel.
fear	Just uh, just stand up straight.
fear	Take a couple deep breaths.

fear	I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
neutral	Okay whats up?
neutral	What I do dois manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.

neutral	You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Not her.
neutral	Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I cant decide between the two of them.
neutral	Yknow the one from Poughkeepsie, even though shes a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun.
neutral	But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown.
neutral	Yknow shes, well shes-shes just as pretty, I guess shes smart, shes
neutral	If shes no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
neutral	Well, I-I want to give her another chance, yknow?
neutral	She lives so close.
neutral	And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasif she was kidding was very funny.
non-neutral	On the other hand, if she wasnt kidding, shes not fun, shes stupid, and kind of a racist.
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	Hey, man!
joy	Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
non-neutral	Damn!

neutral	Yknow?
sadness	Then shell have to come back here and live all alone.
surprise	Oh my God!
surprise	What?
surprise	There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and its positive. Monicas pregnant.  So I guess she wont be totally alone.
neutral	Hi.
sadness	Listen, Im sorry about that whole thing with Roger.
non-neutral	It really wasnt right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think youll really enjoy.

sadness	Im sorry, I thought I could do it and I cant!
joy	Hey!

neutral	Ok, now, remember, no trading.
neutral	You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
joy	Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
neutral	...And what did you bring?
neutral	She's checking the coats.
neutral	Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands.
neutral	Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
surprise	Janice?
surprise	Oh.... my.... God.
non-neutral	Hey, it's Janice.
non-neutral	Well, okay so, I dont have it all worked out quite yet. Just dont say anything to Rachel, please?
neutral	Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
non-neutral	Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
non-neutral	Hey Rach!
surprise	What was that?!
neutral	Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?

joy	All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
non-neutral	Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
joy	Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
joy	Yeah, all of us! All day!
disgust	That sucks!
non-neutral	That's not a trip!
non-neutral	I just came from the park!
non-neutral	What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park?
non-neutral	"Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
non-neutral	Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
surprise	Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!!
surprise	Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey!
anger	Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I justy'knowstop it!
non-neutral	I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
disgust	That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
disgust	Makes me wanna puke!
neutral	Is she in there?
neutral	Yeah. Shes putting her down now, thats her.
neutral	Oh its all right.
sadness	Im guess Im just done with the whole dating thing.
sadness	Its one more thing in my life thats suddenly completely different.
sadness	This is hard.
neutral	Yeah I know.
neutral	On the other hand in um, in about seven months youre gonna have something that youre gonna love more than any guy youve ever gone out with.
neutral	Just wait.
joy	Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger.
joy	You have no idea.
neutral	Thanks sweetie.

neutral	Well, I dont think this, y'know.
disgust	No, no, no, I wouldnt do you myself, I mean that would be weird.

non-neutral	Oh, hey, look, I found coffee!  Okay, lets skedaddle.
neutral	Wait, Im not just gonna drink somebodys old coffee.
neutral	Okay, your highness.
surprise	Um, Rachel Im really sorry.  Thats okay, do you wanna get back together?  Yeah, okay.  Did anyone else hear that?!
surprise	So how did you know I was even here?
neutral	Your mom called me. So is this her?
neutral	No, this is a loaner.
neutral	I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
neutral	I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game?
neutral	Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
neutral	Yeah, they're not so bad.
neutral	Im sorry I wont be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but Im
non-neutral	I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didnt want him to start yelling at me like I was some 74 Latour.
non-neutral	Its Lafite. The 74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
fear	All right here he comes. Im gonna do this, Im gonna tell him, Im gonna be strong.
neutral	I just called a friend of mine.
surprise	Yeah?
neutral	I think I may be able to book
surprise	Really?!
non-neutral	What is it sweetie?
sadness	Theres not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
surprise	What?!
sadness	Im sorry daddy.
non-neutral	I dont believe this!!
fear	Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
anger	Stay calm?!!
anger	How do you expect me to stay calm?!
anger	This is unacceptable Rachel!
anger	And I wanna know why?!!
anger	Is it because that punk Ross wont marry you?!
non-neutral	Thats it!
anger	Is that it?
non-neutral	!
sadness	Yes. Yes, he says Im damaged goods.
surprise	So, youre like a zillionaire?
surprise	And youre our age. Youre our age.
neutral	Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
neutral	What like Pete Dakota?
neutral	Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
neutral	Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
neutral	Thats not a state Joe.

surprise	Youre our age!
neutral	So ah, we on for tomorrow?
joy	Absolutely!
joy	Now get out of here you!!
non-neutral	Okay, Im running out of places I can touch him!
sadness	Look, is there something wrong with me?
sadness	I mean why am I only attracted to guys where theres no future?
sadness	Either theyre too old, or theyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me, and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on!
sadness	I mean, seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me?
neutral	!
neutral	No.
neutral	Okay, Im gonna go get Frank.
neutral	So, were walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, Hey, lets go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes, remember?
non-neutral	And then, and then, you turn to me and say, Nah, lets just hang out at your place. Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
neutral	Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
anger	You know what else Im not gonna miss?
anger	"Im Monica.
anger	I wash the toilet 17 times a day.
anger	Even if people are on it!"
anger	"Hi Im Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, Id better wash it and shrink it!"
anger	"Im Monica, I dont get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
non-neutral	Hey! I call her!
anger	"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
anger	"Oh my God, I cant find a boyfriend!
anger	So I guess Ill just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
neutral	Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
neutral	Item J437-A, color: winterberry.
neutral	Hi umm, listen come here, come in.
sadness	Im so-so sorry about yesterday.
sadness	I-Im really sorry.
non-neutral	Its just that I
neutral	Listen Ross, you dont have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
surprise	You do?
non-neutral	Yeah, you still have feelings for me.
joy	And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you.
sadness	And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we cant.
sadness	Its too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasnt meant to be.
non-neutral	Oh God youre right.
sadness	Ross, wewe have to be strong. Okay, I-Im gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?
neutral	No.
neutral	Im telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
neutral	Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I dont want to make it savory.
neutral	Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
neutral	Gimme this.
neutral	Hi! Okay, dont be mad at me, but I couldnt resist.
surprise	Brides magazines?
neutral	Yes, and I know that youd say no if he asked you, but Im sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
non-neutral	Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.
non-neutral	It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.
non-neutral	I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean I cant.
non-neutral	Right?
non-neutral	I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
surprise	Oh my God.
neutral	I know.  I need more pie.
neutral	Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
surprise	You didnt break up with that fireman?
neutral	No, that was my way of telling you.
neutral	Well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.
neutral	He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
surprise	Wow!
neutral	Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
neutral	So then, are you going to dump Jason?
neutral	Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now sos Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?
neutral	So Its really just about the math.
neutral	Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
anger	Ok, look! Enough is enough!
non-neutral	No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
neutral	Monica, that was also true an
non-neutral	I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
neutral	But...
non-neutral	Look!
neutral	You knew this about me when you married me!
neutral	You agreed to take me in sickness and in health.
non-neutral	Well, this is my sickness!
neutral	Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
neutral	Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
neutral	Yeah me too, all night.
surprise	Really?! How come we didnt cross paths?
neutral	Yeah well thats because uhI stayed in my room. Yeah, you dont want to look in my hamper.
surprise	I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there!
surprise	Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker
neutral	Yeah, okay lets leave these two alone.
disgust	No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
non-neutral	Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
neutral	So.
neutral	So.
neutral	I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.
neutral	I mean, you know, we've never really talked.
neutral	I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
fear	I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
surprise	Really? Me?
neutral	Yes.
surprise	Oh my god, are you kidding?
non-neutral	Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
neutral	Well, you're not totally paranoid.
non-neutral	Oy.
non-neutral	Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
neutral	Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
joy	Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
neutral	I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
neutral	All right, Julie.
neutral	Bye.
disgust	Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.
joy	Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
neutral	Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with the one I picked first.
anger	Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over!
surprise	What?
non-neutral	Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
surprise	They put you in jail?
non-neutral	The little jail between the doors!
anger	Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
non-neutral	I know, Im sorry! But yknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
non-neutral	Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
neutral	Maybe it was the guy.
non-neutral	It was the ring!
neutral	No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
neutral	Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
non-neutral	No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
neutral	Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
neutral	Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend.
surprise	Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
joy	We can, we can go to Aruba!
sadness	When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.
sadness	You would've liked it.
neutral	I had a bra.
neutral	Hey, Dr. Farber.
neutral	All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.

neutral	Okay.
neutral	But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
surprise	What?!
non-neutral	A small puff of air, now come on!
fear	Sure, now Im scared.
neutral	No, we can go together! Just dont wait too long though, okay? Cause Im outta here sometime before Friday.
fear	Yeah, but I dont wanna die!
joy	No-no, itll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
neutral	Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
neutral	Oh, hey.

neutral	No. Y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail.
non-neutral	Yeah!
neutral	Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
surprise	Youre building a post office?
neutral	No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. Its a one day job, max.
surprise	Okay.  My word! Those are snug.
neutral	Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valentes.
neutral	Power saw kinda got away from me there.
joy	Hi!
non-neutral	Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
neutral	So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?
sadness	I cant seem to say goodbye.
surprise	Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
non-neutral	Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
neutral	It was cheesecake.
neutral	It was fine.
surprise	It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  Wow!
joy	My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
non-neutral	Yknow what? Forget it!
neutral	Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted.
neutral	Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
neutral	Mommas Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
neutral	This ones from me.
surprise	Ahh!
neutral	It wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its really fun.

surprise	No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
joy	No, I know! I get it! Its funny!
non-neutral	No, because youre not a grandmother!
non-neutral	No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I dont have any of those things.
neutral	Thats why its so funny.
non-neutral	All you had to do was buy the card!
neutral	Hey, Joey. What's going on?
neutral	Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.

anger	The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
neutral	You gotta do it, man.
non-neutral	Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatevercan't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.

anger	...Now
joy	Oh, look, wish me luck!
neutral	What for?
neutral	I'm gonna go get one of those  job things.

non-neutral	You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
surprise	What? Hes gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!
joy	Hi!
joy	Im so glad you could make it.
non-neutral	Yes, thank you so much. And again, were so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
non-neutral	Try. Theres my little girl.
neutral	Shes still mad.
joy	Yeah I know. Isnt it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
surprise	Phoebe, Sandras mad at you too. It-it doesnt bother you?
neutral	Oh, thats veryReally very-very okay.
joy	Julies cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, thats about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
neutral	Have you felt Rachels cervix Ross?
disgust	No, I dont think well be doing that.
disgust	Were not gonna do that.
neutral	Well, if you like you can feel Rachels and then feel mine to compare.
neutral	Am I interrupting?
joy	Uh yes! Thank you.
neutral	Oh. Oh wait no.
neutral	Later.
non-neutral	No-no-dont! Dont leave me here with these people.
neutral	Oh uh, Im sorry.
fear	No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
neutral	Try feeding her again.
neutral	I already fed her.
non-neutral	I know, that's why I said again!
fear	Alright you guys, we can't turn on each other, Okay?   That's just what she wants.
neutral	Hey.
non-neutral	Phoebe! Rachel! Its Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.
sadness	Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
non-neutral	For what?
sadness	Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
neutral	And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
surprise	You al-you already had it?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
sadness	Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you dont have either.
sadness	We ruined everything.
sadness	Ugh
non-neutral	Well no, wait a minute, thats not true!
joy	No, what did, that was really sweet.
joy	And it kinda works out for the best.
surprise	What do you, what do you mean?
joy	Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!
joy	I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I dont even like!
non-neutral	Surprise
non-neutral	Sur-surprise.
neutral	Monica.
non-neutral	I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
neutral	Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.
neutral	Not you guys.
joy	You got it going on!
neutral	So, what are we gonna do today?
neutral	They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
non-neutral	Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
non-neutral	I don't think so!
neutral	Why not?
neutral	Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
non-neutral	I'm not always that bad!
neutral	Oh,
surprise	I punched you...?
surprise	And...?
surprise	... Phoebe...?
neutral	... and...?
non-neutral	I clunked your heads together!
sadness	Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
neutral	Oh, thats okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
neutral	Yeah.
surprise	Hey!
sadness	I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a fire.
surprise	What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?!
neutral	Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.
fear	All right. Did everyone get out okay?
neutral	Well, the giraffes okay. And so is the pirate.
surprise	Ohh. What is this?
fear	No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under there!!
non-neutral	Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey! How long until Petes fight?
neutral	Oh, about five minutes. Right now theyre interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
neutral	Hot dog?
fear	Four, please.  Im really nervous.  Thank you.
neutral	So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
neutral	What?
surprise	Oh!
joy	I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really terrific.
sadness	Ohh, thats too bad!
non-neutral	No, I-Im saying I liked her.
neutral	Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
non-neutral	Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again.
disgust	Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
neutral	Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?
neutral	Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
joy	Hey, the fights starting!
neutral	Okay, well be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
non-neutral	Nine times!
neutral	Okay, I had to put on lotion!
neutral	But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
neutral	Fights over!
neutral	Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesnt want to get married?
non-neutral	Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.
non-neutral	Hi guys!
neutral	Hey!
neutral	Hey!
neutral	What are you up too?
neutral	Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites.
neutral	Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
neutral	Yeah, Big Brother.
neutral	Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
neutral	Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
non-neutral	Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
neutral	Eh
sadness	Okay well thats good to know.
joy	The Mr. Bowmonts here!!!
joy	Oh thats great, my friend Joeys in the movie business.
neutral	Yknow who I ran into from school? Howie.
neutral	My friends name is Joey.
neutral	Apparently Howies editing now.
non-neutral	Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
surprise	Can you believe that?!
surprise	Yknow I-I-I havent spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
disgust	Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie.
disgust	No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
disgust	The nerve huh?
disgust	Yeah!
neutral	Refill?
non-neutral	Hey! How you doing?
joy	Good! Good, long time no see.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Like your sweater.
neutral	Oh hey, right back at ya.
surprise	Oh, its crazy about Rachel huh?
surprise	Yeah. SheWell, shes one crazy lady?
neutral	So whose is it?
neutral	Umm, I dont some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	He is so weird.
surprise	You wanna fool around with Joey?
joy	Yeah!
joy	You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't    get it out of my head!
surprise	And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
surprise	Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
neutral	Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
neutral	Who, who are they?
neutral	I know them from work.
surprise	Both of them?
neutral	No, one of them...
neutral	Which one?
neutral	I don't know, what were the names I just said?
non-neutral	Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
sadness	All right, all right, you're right
surprise	What the hell are you cooking!
surprise	Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
surprise	Fire alarm?  Oh! Hi, officerfireman, can-can I help you?
non-neutral	We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
non-neutral	Thats not mine.
non-neutral	Yes it is.
fear	How do you know?
disgust	The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, dont wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
anger	Okay do youOkay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
non-neutral	Please reattach this, its against the law to disconnect them.
non-neutral	Fine!  But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
neutral	Theres a reset button under the plastic cover.
surprise	Theres a reset button?!
joy	Ugh, thank you!
joy	Thank you!
surprise	Theres a reset button!
surprise	My God!
surprise	Why didnt I see that!
neutral	Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button?
joy	Oh here it is!
surprise	Oh!
joy	Ohh, God!
neutral	Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
anger	Ring dammit, ring!
neutral	Thanks.
surprise	Hey, you know our phone's not working?
surprise	What?!
neutral	I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
anger	I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
neutral	Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.
non-neutral	Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
anger	Nngghhh!!!!!!!
neutral	Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
neutral	"Heating device."
neutral	Radiator.
neutral	Five letters.
neutral	Rdtor.
surprise	Yeah, is Sidney there?  Oh, this is?  Sidney's a woman.
neutral	Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
neutral	Well, how long do you think it'll be?
neutral	Any minute now.
non-neutral	Hey, this-  Heyy...
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey! Any good mail?
neutral	Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild.
neutral	Ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, Im kinda.
neutral	"Benefits lapsed."
neutral	Hmm thats weird. I dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
neutral	Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year.
surprise	Let me see that!
neutral	All right.
surprise	Oh, I cant believe this!
anger	This sucks!
non-neutral	When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow?
non-neutral	And it wouldnt matter.
non-neutral	Now I gotta be careful?
non-neutral	!
non-neutral	Im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire.
non-neutral	All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see my agent.
neutral	Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
non-neutral	look both ways before you cross the street.
surprise	I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
joy	I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
neutral	Y'know what else I can't believe?
neutral	I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
neutral	Do you know anything about women?
neutral	No.
neutral	That's all right.
neutral	Okay.
joy	Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
joy	Yeah. He could row like a viking.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Mmm.
neutral	So how'd it go?
neutral	Oh, y'know..
neutral	Did he mention us?
sadness	He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
sadness	You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
joy	...love you.
neutral	Are you're hands still wet?
non-neutral	Uh, moist, yeah.
neutral	Let's dry 'em again.
non-neutral	Oh my God! Oh my God!!
surprise	Still crying?
neutral	Like a
neutral	Yknow, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
neutral	Whats the other one?
neutral	I dont know, Ive never had to use the other one.
neutral	Im just saying yknow, if were having sex, hes not gonna be talking.
non-neutral	Oh thats right.
neutral	Youre the talker.
joy	Anyway uh, great idea!
neutral	Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
neutral	Oh, we have some
non-neutral	No you dont!
neutral	Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up.
joy	Great!
neutral	Yeah, what town are we near?
neutral	Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
non-neutral	Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route were on?
neutral	Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
neutral	Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?
non-neutral	I dont know, Im sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?
neutral	Okay!
neutral	Yeah, no they dont do that.
non-neutral	Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
non-neutral	Who?
fear	I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?
neutral	I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
anger	No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
fear	But if...
anger	No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, youll have to think of something else.
joy	Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
non-neutral	So the going for help went well?
neutral	Im telling you man, I saw it.
anger	Yeah, well, youre wrong! Okay, youre wrong.
non-neutral	Im not wrong! I wish I was. Im sorry. Bet that barium enema doesnt sound so bad now, huh?
neutral	I know.
neutral	Lets try a lookof far offwonderment.
joy	Okay, well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and the days to come.
surprise	Chandler!
surprise	What is the matter with your face?!
non-neutral	I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!"
non-neutral	Hey!
anger	Dont laugh at him!
neutral	Hes
joy	Aww!
non-neutral	Thats it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
joy	Were gonna find love!
joy	Definitely!
neutral	Yeah, Im pretty confident about that.
joy	Thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
neutral	It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
neutral	What do you mean?
neutral	Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.
neutral	You mean a backup?
joy	Exactly!
neutral	Yeah, yeah I got that.
neutral	You do?
neutral	Hm-mmm.
neutral	Who?
neutral	Joey.
surprise	Joey?!
joy	Yeah!
surprise	Are you serious?!
non-neutral	Yeah, I locked him years ago!
surprise	Wh So If neither of you are married by the time youre 40, youre gonna marry Joey.
neutral	Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
surprise	Oh, seriously?
neutral	Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
neutral	Yeah, Im sorry man.  You wanna go watch?
joy	Yeah!
neutral	Good morning.
non-neutral	Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
joy	Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
non-neutral	Ohh thats nice.
joy	Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
disgust	Wo-women? You mean like old women?
neutral	Well kinda old, like 30.
neutral	Oh.
surprise	And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
surprise	Thats great! Wow man, so Joey mustve really taught you some stuff huh?
neutral	A little.
surprise	Yeah?
neutral	How you doin?
joy	Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
neutral	I know.
non-neutral	So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
surprise	What did you just say?
joy	You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
surprise	Are you serious?!
joy	Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
joy	I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
joy	Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!
joy	Whoa!
non-neutral	Where have I heard that before?
neutral	Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas.
neutral	I guess it must've been some movie I saw.
neutral	What do you say?
joy	Okay!
joy	Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
non-neutral	Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
neutral	It went under the table.
non-neutral	Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
joy	All right!
joy	Here it is! Here it is!
neutral	That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
neutral	It's a four.
neutral	I think so too.
joy	Well thats it. Im done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats.
joy	Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you.
neutral	Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
neutral	Is there anything we can do for you?
neutral	No just, nobody press on my stomach.
neutral	You can keep those pants by the way.
surprise	Whoaheywh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
neutral	Yeah, you want some?
joy	Ah, just cut me a little sliver.
neutral	A little bigger.
neutral	Little bigger.
surprise	What?!
non-neutral	Are you afraid youre gonna run out?!
anger	Cut me a real piece!
surprise	Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
neutral	I need to talk to you, its pretty urgent. Its about Monica and Chandler.
surprise	Oh my God!
neutral	Of course, of course.
neutral	Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?
neutral	Umm, do you know each others hometowns?
non-neutral	Why dont you   Wh-whats going on?
neutral	Well, umm, not much.
neutral	But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow?
neutral	So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
neutral	Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler?
neutral	NothingWhy?!
anger	Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
neutral	Oh yeah it is! Im going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
anger	Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
neutral	Oh, Im sorry. Im so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
non-neutral	Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this.
fear	Okay,  I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life without you.
sadness	Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.
sadness	Your good heart Rach,  and, and....
neutral	No.
sadness	I cant, youre a totally different person to me now.
sadness	I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.
non-neutral	God, and now I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant,  it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.
sadness	Its just changed, everything.
sadness	Forever.
non-neutral	Yeah, but this cant be it, I mean.
sadness	Then how come it is?
neutral	Windows are clean, candels are lit.
non-neutral	Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt.
neutral	Did I turn the fish?
neutral	No, cause I made lasagne.
non-neutral	Am I out of control?
neutral	Just a touch.
non-neutral	Mon, I don't understand.
surprise	I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms?
surprise	I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
neutral	What?
non-neutral	Could tonight be the Night?
neutral	I don't know.
non-neutral	Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know.
non-neutral	Things happen, and they happen.
neutral	You don't plan these things.
neutral	So, did you shave your legs?
neutral	Yeah.
surprise	A-ha!
non-neutral	Ross!
non-neutral	Ben!   I mean, Ben! Ben!
neutral	Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
joy	Hi!
neutral	Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
fear	Uh-oh.
non-neutral	Is there a problem?
non-neutral	Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato.
neutral	But that's okay, no problem.
neutral	No problem.
non-neutral	Hmm, noodle soup.
neutral	Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
surprise	Oh, what did I say?
neutral	Hmm, noodle soup.
surprise	How's that different?  Oh! Yeah!
neutral	All right, let's try one.
neutral	Hmm, noodle soup.

anger	No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look!  Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
neutral	Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
neutral	Yeah?
neutral	Give her some money.
neutral	I really think theyre out of rooms.
anger	Theyre not!! Ross, theyre just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
neutral	Well then wed be in a lot of trouble, you dont know where any countries are.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?
neutral	This is a hospital.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Yknow what?
non-neutral	Id have to say I really dont care for your tone.
anger	And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem toWhoa!
surprise	Oh gosh!
surprise	Whoa!
surprise	What-what?
surprise	Ow! Ow! Contraction.  Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
neutral	Would you like to see a semi-private room?
neutral	Yeah, it couldnt hurt to look.
neutral	I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
non-neutral	That's funny. Who are they?
neutral	The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
surprise	You mean they're lovers.
neutral	If you wanna put a label on it.
surprise	Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
non-neutral	Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
neutral	Okay, quick and painful.
fear	Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
surprise	Oh, what? What-what?
neutral	Y'know Marcel?
neutral	...Yeah?
non-neutral	Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
joy	Hi Pheebs!
joy	Hi!
neutral	How are ya?
neutral	Good.
neutral	Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guys cell phone?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
joy	Yeah!
non-neutral	And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
fear	Ooh, now you lost me.
anger	You stole the phone!
non-neutral	No I didnt!
non-neutral	No? So youre saying that if I called it, it wouldnt ring?
fear	No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work!
anger	Phoebe!
non-neutral	Its not here.
neutral	Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why dont you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
neutral	How could I have left them in the copy room?
anger	I dont know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? Its not a perfect world! Just go please.
anger	Fine.
non-neutral	Thank you.  Hello?  I still dont get it.
joy	How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
neutral	This will be your phone.
neutral	That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
neutral	No you answer it and take pledges.
surprise	But I'm the host!
neutral	No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
neutral	You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
neutral	Well, here's your phone doctor.
neutral	Hey guys.
surprise	Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean youre going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
neutral	Well, hes very charming.
disgust	I know, hes too charming, but if you two start going out, then its just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
neutral	Well, youre just gonna have to try.
neutral	Joey, where are the
neutral	I dont know, Chandler is supposed to be passin em around...
neutral	Phew, close one.
surprise	Oh!
surprise	Look what happened!
sadness	Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up.
non-neutral	Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.
neutral	Hey.
non-neutral	Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
joy	Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
surprise	Oh Im sorry! Do you need a break?
non-neutral	My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
joy	I can see it from right here. Itll cost you one husband.
non-neutral	Okay, Im sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
non-neutral	Come on more!
non-neutral	Oh God!
neutral	Yeah, you like that dont you?
joy	Oh yeah right there!
joy	You want it there? You take it there baby!
non-neutral	Uh Phoebe?
non-neutral	Yeah, say my name. Say it!  And now Im going to cover you back up, and umm were never doing this again.
anger	Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy?
anger	Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be!
neutral	Huh?
anger	Because I sure as hell cant figure it out!
neutral	I talk to you and its nothin.
neutral	You look at me, and nothin.
neutral	Nothing.
joy	You guys make me fly! High! Okay, were gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
neutral	Well, that was ah...
surprise	What?! What are you doing?!
non-neutral	Do you know what just happened?
neutral	Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
neutral	No. We were in the middle of sexand
non-neutral	Nooo! No, thats not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world!
neutral	Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
neutral	Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
surprise	Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
non-neutral	Oh, it's not!
surprise	Seriously, it's moving!

neutral	I had such an opportunity in the recent, present.
non-neutral	And Im ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually.
anger	Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him.

neutral	Um, see, but thats not the final draft.
non-neutral	Its laminated!
neutral	Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
neutral	Y'know its ironic...

neutral	We have one.
disgust	I know. Use it.
surprise	Oh Mon, listen I have to ask!

non-neutral	Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Yknow I just wish we could be like on a break!
non-neutral	Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
neutral	So thats the only reason she could be here huh?
neutral	It couldnt have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe Im a good listener and I uh I put on a
non-neutral	Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
neutral	Yknow what?
neutral	I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to you later.
neutral	Good-bye.

neutral	Uh, that was your sister actually.
neutral	She-she thinks that youre just using me.
neutral	So?
sadness	Im sorry.
surprise	What are you doing here?!
neutral	I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Umm, okay, okay, look.
non-neutral	I took this picture from your fridge.
non-neutral	Okay, because I know that this is my Father.
non-neutral	Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.
anger	Now, look I deserve to know where I came from.
non-neutral	All right?
anger	So if you can help me find my Father then you should!
anger	Otherwise, youre just mean!
anger	So, just tell me the truth!
non-neutral	All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
surprise	My Father is Chuck Magioni?
neutral	No, no, thats just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!
sadness	And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats the truth.
sadness	Oh.
neutral	But umm, youre right.
neutral	I think that a person should know where they come from.
neutral	Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay.
neutral	Im your mother.
surprise	Heh?
sadness	Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
surprise	Whats happening to your accent?
surprise	Come again?
non-neutral	Whats-whats this nonsense?
sadness	All right, Im-Im not English.
neutral	Im from Long Island.
non-neutral	I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.
sadness	Im sorry.
non-neutral	So, if we could just get back to the lecture.
neutral	Umm, were there any questions?
neutral	About paleontology.
non-neutral	All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.
non-neutral	Obviously, I screwed up.
non-neutral	But what you guys think of me is really important because Im-Im hoping to get a permanent job here.
non-neutral	So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
non-neutral	Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am
non-neutral	Well, hello Rachel!
neutral	Where you going, Joe?
neutral	For a walk.
non-neutral	Oh. You mind if I join you?
neutral	Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.
surprise	Your thoughts? Plural?
joy	Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!
neutral	I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
non-neutral	Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??
non-neutral	You guys are killing me!
non-neutral	She's forbidden fruit!
non-neutral	It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?
neutral	Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?
neutral	Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
non-neutral	Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
surprise	Great novels?
neutral	Fine ... mediocre porn
neutral	Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office.
neutral	Now, he doesnt get in until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
non-neutral	Thats kinda sad.
neutral	Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,
joy	Got it!
joy	Lets roll!
neutral	Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
neutral	Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anythingminute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan.
neutral	Uh actually, Id like to speak with both of you.
neutral	Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
neutral	Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
neutral	Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
non-neutral	Oh! No problem! I
surprise	What?
neutral	You are iron.
joy	You are steel!
non-neutral	Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
neutral	I told you, were adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
surprise	I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
neutral	Look, you and I went to different high schools...
neutral	Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school.
neutral	You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.
non-neutral	I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
surprise	They had to have that specially made?!
neutral	It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
surprise	Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
surprise	Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out.
joy	And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.
neutral	I-I owe her this.
neutral	I never let her eat.
neutral	Oh, you go out with him.
surprise	Oh, really?!
neutral	Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
neutral	Ill try.
neutral	Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that youre dancing with.
neutral	Yeah, yeah, okay.
non-neutral	Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown  Im trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
anger	Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, shes real, uh, mellow!
neutral	Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know
anger	Ross, get over it! Its not like she hates you.
sadness	Yeah but
neutral	Ross, shes not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
non-neutral	Huh. Yknow whats not one of a kind? A twin!
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	Hey!
joy	Ooh, Phoebes here! Okay, lets turn out all the lights and well just watch the movie!
joy	Okay. HeyOoh, cool sheets!
joy	Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
joy	Sure!
non-neutral	He got it a flea market!
disgust	You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
neutral	And Joey?
neutral	How do you think she's doing?
surprise	Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
surprise	Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
joy	Thank you!
neutral	Now that Rachel's gone?
non-neutral	So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
non-neutral	Oh, god help us.
surprise	What?
disgust	Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
disgust	Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
non-neutral	What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
sadness	I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
joy	So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
joy	Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
neutral	Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
surprise	What do you mean?
sadness	Carol our sex life isits just not working
joy	Hey there little fella!
neutral	Hey, uh-hey, why dont we get some shoes on ya, huh?
joy	Hey, why dont you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room!
joy	Yay!
surprise	!
joy	Yay!
joy	Yay!
non-neutral	Seriously, our sex life I was thinking, maybe I dont know, we could try some-some new things.
neutral	Yknow?
neutral	For fun?
surprise	Like what?
non-neutral	Well I dont know umm,  what if we were too tie each other up?
neutral	Umm, some people eat stuff off one another.
disgust	Nah!
neutral	Umm, yknow we-we could try dirty talk?
neutral	Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
joy	I love that idea!
joy	Hey, Sophie!
non-neutral	So whos idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
anger	Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
surprise	Oh my God, they took my idea!
surprise	That was you?!
non-neutral	Yeah! Okay, here you go.

neutral	Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
neutral	Yes, but, Ross you
non-neutral	What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
sadness	Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
surprise	Why would we do that?
sadness	Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
neutral	Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
non-neutral	Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
surprise	The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
neutral	The balloon?
neutral	No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached

neutral	I know
joy	Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
joy	I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
joy	The sun is out!
non-neutral	Hey! Remember when I had corneas?

non-neutral	Hi uh, Im Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect Id like to donate some fluids.
neutral	Were actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so were not looking for applicants right now.
sadness	Oh thats too bad. Ive kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure theres no studies I can participate in?
neutral	Well, heres a schedule of whats coming up.
neutral	Thanks.  Well but this one starts now.

neutral	Hey! Hows it goin?
neutral	Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
joy	Yes it has! I made cookies!
neutral	Oh thats all right. Im still full from your homemade potato chips.
non-neutral	But you should eat them now because theyre hot from the oven.
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	Oh-ho! But not in here! Cant eat em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
neutral	Okay, Ill be out in a second.
neutral	Okay!
neutral	What are you doing?
neutral	That doesnt lock does it?
disgust	You know, it still smells like monkey in there.

neutral	Me too, we should get goin'.
neutral	No.
neutral	Oh. Mine does.
neutral	Okay, here comes another camera.
neutral	Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
neutral	Why do they keep doing that?

neutral	Theyve been taping those people up there all day.
neutral	Right.
non-neutral	Hey, whatd you guys do to get up on there?
non-neutral	Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
joy	Yeah!
surprise	Hey! Youre a good dancer!

surprise	My son? Pretty serious.  Oh hey Katie!  What uh, what are you doing here?
neutral	Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this.

neutral	Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.
neutral	Oh.
fear	Oh uhI actually came here to ask you out.
joy	Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. Im just gonna put this  back in my pocket, pretend

non-neutral	Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
neutral	Well, like father, like son.
joy	Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
surprise	Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
non-neutral	Well, y'know, possibly.  You didnt tell him that, though? Right?
neutral	Ummmmmmmm, no.
non-neutral	You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell the guy that!
non-neutral	Why not?! Id be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to getoh I see.
non-neutral	Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea.
non-neutral	Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
neutral	Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
surprise	Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
surprise	Instead of...?
neutral	That's right.
neutral	Never had that dream.
neutral	No.
neutral	All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
surprise	And they weren't looking at you before?!
neutral	Finally, I figure I'd better answer it,
joy	Honey! Dinners ready!
joy	Whats my little chef got for me tonight?
joy	Your favorite!
joy	Ho-ho-ho,  fried stuff with cheese!
joy	Yep! And lots of it!

neutral	Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate.
non-neutral	So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is.
neutral	Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
surprise	Oh my god.
surprise	What?
non-neutral	Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
neutral	Come on, they're close.
disgust	Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
neutral	Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
disgust	Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
neutral	Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
disgust	Oh my god, what were you thinking?
neutral	All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
surprise	Oh!
surprise	Ow!
disgust	I'm outta here.
neutral	Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
surprise	Really?
neutral	Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
joy	Hello! One marriage please!
joy	Yep, we wanna get married!
neutral	All right.
joy	Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
neutral	What are you doing?

neutral	Are you sure you wanna do this?
joy	Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
joy	Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
neutral	Wait!  Okay!
neutral	Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
neutral	It depends on who asked.
neutral	What if I asked?
neutral	Oh, Mon, sure.
surprise	Really?
surprise	Yes.  Youre not asking are you?
neutral	No.
joy	Yes! Totally!
joy	Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
joy	Youarenot going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
surprise	He asked you out?!
non-neutral	No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
joy	Saucy!
neutral	What are these?
neutral	Electrical plans for the building.
fear	Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
neutral	I know that switch does something, okay?
neutral	So-so I went down to city hall and got these.
non-neutral	All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
surprise	Wow! If only more people knew.
neutral	Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in
neutral	Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
neutral	So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
neutral	Oh, nobody's judging you.
non-neutral	Oh! Okay!  You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!
surprise	Oh man!
joy	I want that place so much!!
non-neutral	I was so sure that was gonna work!
disgust	There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
neutral	All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
neutral	Bye!
neutral	Bye!
sadness	Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.
disgust	Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
surprise	Actually, I did!
neutral	Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
surprise	Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
surprise	Are you serious?
non-neutral	Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
non-neutral	Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsShe knows!

non-neutral	What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
neutral	Okay, some tricks of the trade.
neutral	Now, Ive never been able to cry as an actor, so if Im in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling.
neutral	Or ah, or, lets say I wanna convey that Ive just done something evil.
neutral	That would be the basic I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it  Okay, lets say Ive just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.
neutral	And thats how its done.

non-neutral	No!
neutral	Didnt think so!
neutral	Okay, cmon guys, show us where the presents are!
non-neutral	Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thats as good as garbage?

neutral	What?
surprise	Im just saying, this woman, I mean shes fictitious. No?
non-neutral	Why would you say that?
neutral	Cause youre still into Monica.
neutral	So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
non-neutral	Youre good. Youre good!
neutral	Yeah, no, Im fairly intuitive and psychic. Its a substantial gift.
fear	Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though?
neutral	Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
non-neutral	Thanks a lot.
neutral	No Im serious. I mean Im intuitive, but my memory sucks.

neutral	Theres someone here who can explain this better than I can.
neutral	Hi Frank.
neutral	Hi, Mrs. Knight.
neutral	Phoebes right Frank.
neutral	I know its hard to hear, but it wouldve been wrong to go through with it.
sadness	I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not.
non-neutral	Is that it, is that what it is?
neutral	Yeah, but not just that.
sadness	Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less
neutral	None the less.
sadness	None the less. Umm, youre too young to, to really know what you want.
neutral	Thats right, exactly.
non-neutral	All right, its a good bye kiss, thats good.
neutral	Bye-bye.
non-neutral	Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what Im saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong.

neutral	Thats what you think.
neutral	Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers? Wouldnt they have the recipe?

joy	Absolutely!
joy	I am so on board!
non-neutral	Rachel didn't you just light that?
neutral	Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.

disgust	It's worse than the thumb!
anger	Hey, this is so unfair!
surprise	Oh, why is it unfair?
non-neutral	So I have a flaw!
anger	Big deal!
non-neutral	Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?
non-neutral	And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?
non-neutral	And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?
disgust	I mean, what the hell is that thing?
non-neutral	...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
non-neutral	...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
neutral	Well, I-I could live without it.
non-neutral	Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
neutral	Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
anger	Oh,  "you do, do you"?
neutral	You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
non-neutral	"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
neutral	Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.

neutral	Hey.
neutral	You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
neutral	Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
neutral	Probably?
disgust	Yeah, I don't like that word.
neutral	Kind of what probably really means.
neutral	Yeah, uh-huh.
non-neutral	Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow?
non-neutral	I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!"
neutral	Yknow?
neutral	You gotta take care of yourselves!
neutral	In
neutral	Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
joy	Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
joy	Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesnt he?
neutral	Hes a keeper. How are you feeling?
neutral	Oh, Im fine.
neutral	Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her all alone.
neutral	Oh, Im not doing it alone. I have Ross.
neutral	Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
neutral	Well then he gets a divorce, its Ross!
neutral	Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family.
non-neutral	Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.
disgust	Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
neutral	Hey. Whos that?
neutral	New people.
neutral	What happened to the Disgustingtons?
non-neutral	Theyre having their baby!
anger	Its not fair Ross we got here first!
neutral	Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.
neutral	Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
surprise	Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
neutral	Phoebe?
neutral	Yeah?
surprise	Look at that guy by the window, wow!
neutral	Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.
sadness	Oh, what is wrong with me lately?
neutral	I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here.
non-neutral	Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
neutral	Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
surprise	Really?! So this has happened to you?
neutral	Oh absolutely yeah!
neutral	Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
non-neutral	Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap.
neutral	Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a
disgust	Ugh!
fear	I dont know what Im going to do!
anger	I called the company that sent and th-they dont care!
non-neutral	Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is?
joy	Hey guys!
joy	Hey!
neutral	Hey
joy	I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!
joy	And the guys from work had a blast.
non-neutral	Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
non-neutral	Yeah!
surprise	And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
non-neutral	So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice!
non-neutral	Yeah, right!
neutral	I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those
surprise	That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
surprise	So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
joy	Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
non-neutral	So you might say, its a magic ring.
surprise	OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!
neutral	Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
neutral	Obviously! So, how do we decide?
neutral	Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should date her
neutral	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
non-neutral	Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her
neutral	Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
neutral	Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
neutral	Yeah well we should order some food then.
non-neutral	No Joey! Look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, well
neutral	That sounds fair.
neutral	Maybe Ill take her to that new French restaurant down the street
non-neutral	Ah yeahwait a second now!
neutral	Look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.
non-neutral	I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
neutral	Well sorry, thats what I do on dates.
neutral	All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates.
neutral	So lets decide on the spending limit
neutral	Yeah. Uh, a slicesix dollars?
neutral	I was thinking more like a hundred.
neutral	Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
neutral	Hi, again.
neutral	Hey!
neutral	Hey!
joy	Thank you soo, much.
anger	Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
neutral	You want some help with that?
neutral	Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I dont!
surprise	Whoa! Are you okay?
surprise	Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
neutral	Its the heat.  And-and the humidity.
neutral	Thats a uh, thats a tough combination.
neutral	Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
surprise	Like you wouldnt believe.  Wow! This is a great place.
neutral	What do you mean?
neutral	Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
surprise	Oh!
neutral	Hey, somebody left their keys.
surprise	Ooohh, to a Porsche!
surprise	Transcribers note: Oh come on!
surprise	Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind?
neutral	If I had a Porsche, Id have the keys surgically attached to my hand!
neutral	Hey Gunther, these yours?
disgust	Yeah, thats what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
neutral	Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?
neutral	Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found?
surprise	Theres a lost and found?  My shoe!
surprise	You left a shoe here?!
neutral	Well, I didnt realize until I got home.
neutral	I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!
neutral	Yknow what?
neutral	Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.
neutral	Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe.
joy	Great! Thanks.
neutral	Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
non-neutral	Carol, we've been through this before, ok?
joy	We have a good time.
joy	We laugh, we play.
joy	It's like we're father and son.
joy	Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
joy	Oh, this is so cute.
neutral	Oh, I got that for him.
joy	My mommies love me. That's clever.
neutral	Hello?
neutral	Oh, Hi, JuHi, Jew!
neutral	Uh huh?
neutral	Uh huh?
neutral	Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great.
neutral	See ya then.
neutral	Bye.
surprise	Did you just say Hi, Jew?
neutral	Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
non-neutral	Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes!
joy	Thanks Monica!
disgust	Does that smell bother you?
surprise	What the smell from Joeys? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
neutral	Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie to cover it.
non-neutral	I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
joy	Okay!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  Its for you. Its the fire inspector.
surprise	Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!
non-neutral	Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair straightener that started the fire.
neutral	No-no, it was the candles.
non-neutral	Its very not good leaving candles unattended.
neutral	In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay.
neutral	Well, I have to go now.
surprise	Joey proposed to me.
surprise	Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!
fear	Well, I-I said yes.
surprise	What?!
non-neutral	Are you crazy?
non-neutral	You just had Ross's baby!
non-neutral	It's-it's so  inappropriate.
disgust	No, it's worse than that.
disgust	It's wrong.
surprise	It's… It is bigger than  mine!
neutral	I know.
non-neutral	You can't marry him!
non-neutral	Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.
neutral	Well do you love him?
neutral	Sure.
non-neutral	Sure?
neutral	Yeah, I mean whatever.
non-neutral	Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?
non-neutral	No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
neutral	So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
non-neutral	Here comes the bride.
surprise	Oh my God Monica!
joy	I wanna wear this everyday.
joy	You look so beautiful.
joy	Im so happy for me.
neutral	Hello?
non-neutral	Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
neutral	Yeah, we got him back. Everythings fine.
anger	Damnit!
neutral	Uh, yknow what?
anger	Ill tell you who it hurts!
anger	It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principals office wearing nothing but a catchers mitt!
neutral	That was
anger	I will be! Listen, I dont want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
neutral	Fine.
non-neutral	Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.
non-neutral	And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want!
neutral	No thats not what I want. Uh, Im glad you guys were bonding but I
non-neutral	Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff!
non-neutral	And I havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway!
anger	Crap!!
neutral	I gotta go!
surprise	Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
neutral	No.
surprise	Me neither! We have to get in!
neutral	Just act like you belong.
surprise	Oh my God! Oranges!
neutral	Shh!  Nice to see you again.
neutral	Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
neutral	Yes, of course.
neutral	Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see the seat number.
neutral	Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A.
non-neutral	Okay.  Mrs. Green! Okay Im really sorry!! Im apologizing for the  Okay, I bit my tongue, but Im
joy	Hey! Look whos back! Its the birthday girl! Hows the birthday girl feeling?
non-neutral	Well, I feel fine, but I think youre bumming out the rest of the kids.
surprise	What?
non-neutral	Okay!
neutral	Yknow what?
non-neutral	I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.
neutral	All I really needed was a plan.
neutral	See I wanna have three kids
non-neutral	Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
neutral	As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time Im 35 which gives me five years.
joy	I love this plan!
joy	I wanna marry this plan!
non-neutral	You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed!
non-neutral	Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,
non-neutral	Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too yknow!
non-neutral	Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
neutral	I dont know.
disgust	Why am I not surprised?
anger	Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this!
neutral	I dont think you have much choice.
anger	Well well see!
neutral	Bye-bye!
neutral	Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?
neutral	Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .
neutral	Dad?
neutral	Im here!
surprise	Hey!
non-neutral	Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
sadness	Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.
neutral	Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
neutral	Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
sadness	Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.
joy	Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of the memories
neutral	Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven
neutral	I used to
neutral	Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
neutral	Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a
neutral	Ok, got the vent open.
joy	Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
neutral	Ben, you ready?
neutral	All right, gimme your foot.
neutral	Ok, on three, Ben.
neutral	One, two, three.
neutral	Ok, That's it, Ben.
neutral	What do you see?
neutral	Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
surprise	Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
surprise	Wait! You forgot your legs!
joy	You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
joy	Thank you.
neutral	Filing system?
surprise	Oh-oh!
neutral	You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?
joy	It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
neutral	Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
neutral	I notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
joy	Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
joy	Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost
neutral	I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
non-neutral	Oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!
neutral	Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
neutral	Yes, I realize that
neutral	And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
joy	I love working with designers!
neutral	With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?
neutral	Chandler, you have an assistant right?
fear	Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
neutral	Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
surprise	I do?
neutral	Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Or not.
neutral	Where's Chandler?
neutral	Here I am.
disgust	Wash your hands!!!
surprise	How did youknow?
surprise	Hey! What's she doing back here?
neutral	Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
neutral	Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
surprise	What happened in Atlantic City?!
neutral	Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
non-neutral	Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
neutral	And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?
neutral	So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.
non-neutral	Now, I know what youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls.
surprise	You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
non-neutral	In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
joy	Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
non-neutral	Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
neutral	Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
neutral	So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
non-neutral	Of course I am!
neutral	Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot.
neutral	Ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.
neutral	And-and then guess what?
non-neutral	The babys coming and I dont know what to do.
non-neutral	Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
neutral	No. Sweetie, youre gonna be fine.
non-neutral	Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
neutral	Im going to the bathroom.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay.
neutral	It
joy	Hey!
non-neutral	Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
neutral	I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
neutral	Not if you were here.
neutral	Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
joy	Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope its you!
neutral	I hope its you.
joy	Me too!
non-neutral	First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so important to me
non-neutral	Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
neutral	Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.
neutral	Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine
joy	Yes!!! Oh!!
non-neutral	Hypothetically!
neutral	Still.
neutral	If Phoebe were my maid of honor
neutral	Uh-hmm.
neutral	Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
neutral	Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.
neutral	Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours?
neutral	Well thats the best part. Umm,
surprise	Wh-why is that the best part?
joy	Because then I dont have to!
neutral	Well of
non-neutral	Im really not deciding!
non-neutral	Fine!
neutral	Yeah thats right.
joy	Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!
neutral	If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?
neutral	It's not just the drum noise.
non-neutral	Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye!
non-neutral	Oh god, my eye!"
non-neutral	I mean, it is so annoying.
neutral	Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
surprise	Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
neutral	Maybe on some level.
surprise	Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
neutral	No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you.
joy	Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you.
joy	And, a brownie!
neutral	Well, half a brownie.
neutral	Actually, its just bag.
neutral	Its been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin to feel faint so
joy	Oh man!
joy	This is so great!
joy	I actually feel like Im going on a real date!
neutral	Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and Im wearing underwear that goes up to aboutthere.
non-neutral	Hey come on now, this is a real date.
neutral	Uh, sonice place you got here.
surprise	Foosball, huh?
neutral	Pizza box.
surprise	Oh, a subscription to
neutral	Yeah, actually thats my roommates.
neutral	I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
neutral	Ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch yourself.
non-neutral	Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking?
neutral	Hm-mmm.
neutral	Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
neutral	Yeah, but Im pretty sure hes gay.
non-neutral	No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
anger	Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
neutral	Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
joy	Ha. Ha, ha.
neutral	What?
neutral	Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
disgust	Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
neutral	Oh, I beg to differ. The
neutral	That was
joy	Oooooh.  : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
surprise	Well, not playing raquetball!
surprise	He forgot to leave his grip size!
surprise	He didn't get the goggles!
neutral	Well,sounds like you two have issues.
neutral	Goodbye, baby.
neutral	Ciao, bela.
neutral	Do they wait for me to do this?
neutral	So are you gonna tell him?
neutral	Why would I tell him?
neutral	How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
non-neutral	Oh...
non-neutral	What are you guys doing here?
surprise	Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
neutral	...What did I ask?
disgust	God. I feel violated.
disgust	Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
neutral	Ross, ten o'clock.
non-neutral	Is it? Feels like two.
neutral	No,
neutral	What?
joy	There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
joy	Oh. Hel-lo!
joy	She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
joy	Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
fear	Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
joy	Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
neutral	Oh please, could she
neutral	He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
joy	Thank you, buddy.
neutral	Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
joy	You could do that!
surprise	Y'think?
neutral	OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
neutral	OK.
joy	This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
neutral	Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
neutral	Last time I do that, I promise.
sadness	I am so, so, so, so sorry!
disgust	Uh-huh.

neutral	Okay.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	So, are we going in there?
joy	I am!!
surprise	Wow!
neutral	It actually is in the handbook.
non-neutral	I cant date you or have a hot plate in my office.
non-neutral	I cant believe we have to stop seeing each other.
non-neutral	For what its worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
neutral	I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we cant date. Its against the rules. Its forbidden.
surprise	Wow!
surprise	What?
joy	Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, its really hot.
surprise	Really?
neutral	Yeah.
non-neutral	Well I-I-I dont care how hot it is its-its uh, its wrong.
non-neutral	Stop it!
non-neutral	No! No! Its wrong! Its-its-its naughty. Its taboo.
non-neutral	Shut the book!
joy	Lets also get a hot plate!
joy	Rach, youre in a great place in your life. Come on, youve got a great job! Good friends
non-neutral	Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
neutral	Oh Im not, I just like to try these on.
neutral	I do the same thing.
joy	Im just kidding. Im getting married July 25
joy	Im just kidding too.  Im getting married in December.
neutral	So when are you getting married?
neutral	Oh May 15
joy	Oooh its getting close!
joy	Yeah!
neutral	So uh, whos your photographer?
neutral	Jeffery.
non-neutral	We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
surprise	The best man? Wow!
joy	I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, whos your band?!
neutral	Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
non-neutral	Oh, youre so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
joy	Ooh, is that spelled with a C or a K? Oh my God! It doesnt matter; theyre both great!
neutral	Oh yknow what?
neutral	Yknow what?
neutral	Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinmans and get it half off.
disgust	This place is so overpriced.
neutral	So, does this  come in another color or
neutral	I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time.
surprise	It was unbelievable!
joy	We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
neutral	So have you called her yet?
fear	Let her know I like her?
non-neutral	What are you, insane?
non-neutral	It's the next day!
non-neutral	How needy do I want to seem?
non-neutral	I'm right, right?
neutral	Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
surprise	I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
non-neutral	Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
neutral	Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.
neutral	Her answer machine?
neutral	No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
neutral	So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
disgust	Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
surprise	Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
neutral	Okay, okay, what's going on?
neutral	Okay, they're just talking...
neutral	Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
neutral	So, um, what do you do for a living?
neutral	Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
neutral	Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
sadness	I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
neutral	Now that is funny.
neutral	Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?
sadness	'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
neutral	I guess.
neutral	Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
neutral	Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
neutral	Come on.
neutral	These people'll scooch down.
neutral	You guys'll scooch, won't you?
joy	Let's try scooching!
neutral	Come on.
neutral	Come on.
neutral	Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.
neutral	Carol, Kristin.
neutral	Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.
non-neutral	And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	All right.
neutral	When I was six years old.
neutral	Hm-mmm.
neutral	I wanted a big wheel.
non-neutral	And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.
sadness	It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me.

surprise	Oh!
anger	Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
surprise	That's patio furniture!
neutral	So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
neutral	What about the birds?
neutral	I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
neutral	You pick one.
neutral	All right, how about the ladybugs?
non-neutral	Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
non-neutral	Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
non-neutral	Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!

non-neutral	Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while?
non-neutral	Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
neutral	Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
neutral	Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
neutral	Why? What happened to him?
neutral	Nothing, hes just really believes in that.
neutral	It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
joy	Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
neutral	Well, okay, so whats nowgo get, go get the eggs, put em in there.
neutral	Okay, itll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
surprise	Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
neutral	Um-hmm, five actually.
neutral	Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
neutral	We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
surprise	Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
neutral	Hey, yknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
neutral	Sweety, now, shes a woman, not a gumball machine.
neutral	Okay, well yknow what, dont worry you guys, cause Im-Im gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
neutral	Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.

non-neutral	I know! Why dont you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
neutral	Sorry. So hows it going with Joey?
neutral	Oh just great.
neutral	He beeps me now with codes.
neutral	One is, "Bring me food."
neutral	Two is, "Im with a girl, bring us food."
neutral	Three is, "Im lost and I cant find food."
non-neutral	Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
joy	Yeah! Shes right in there!
joy	Oh great.   Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
neutral	Hey!
neutral	Hey!
surprise	You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
disgust	Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
non-neutral	Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
neutral	I don't know, clean places?
neutral	Umm, yum!
neutral	It's Danny.
fear	Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
non-neutral	We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?

neutral	Here justtake this.
non-neutral	That's stealing!
neutral	No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
non-neutral	Ohh.
neutral	Okay, one thing at a time.
neutral	Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
joy	Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
joy	Oh, that's great.
surprise	Why are- why are you so tanned?
neutral	Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
joy	Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk.

non-neutral	Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that.
joy	I'm- I'm Monana!
neutral	Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
joy	Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
neutral	What?
non-neutral	They've arrested Monica.
neutral	Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.
neutral	Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
neutral	No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
neutral	Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y.
neutral	I just...
neutral	I wrote that out phonetically for you.
neutral	Phonetically?
neutral	Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this.
neutral	Ok.
surprise	Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
non-neutral	Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"    I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
surprise	Wow. What does
non-neutral	No idea!
non-neutral	But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
neutral	Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
neutral	Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .

non-neutral	I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us!
non-neutral	And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
neutral	So umm, does it?
sadness	Im sorry.
fear	Does it?
neutral	Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole Does it? part just another glance.
anger	What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!
anger	Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesnt, and if you have to even

neutral	Yes.
neutral	So thats your second marriage in two years.
neutral	Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
neutral	Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client.
neutral	Why dont you tell me what happened.
neutral	Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
surprise	Im sorry, is this the same Rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
non-neutral	Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do

surprise	Ooh!
surprise	Theres no way to do this without her?
fear	Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
non-neutral	No!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
neutral	But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
neutral	Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
surprise	What?
neutral	Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
neutral	That's alright, I'll take it.
neutral	Bad things happen to me anyway.

neutral	Because every time were in the room together theres this weird like energy between us.
neutral	And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too.
non-neutral	And now I have seen her naked.
neutral	I mean at least when Ive seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something.
neutral	But there are no boles, shes smooth!
neutral	Smooth!
surprise	Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
surprise	Yeah! Oh my God!
surprise	So, you and Angela, huh?
joy	Yep. Pretty much.
surprise	Oh, that's what she meant!

non-neutral	It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
non-neutral	Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section

neutral	Dad, that wont matter to her.
non-neutral	Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all hers is-is, is growing new stuff!
non-neutral	See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
surprise	Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
non-neutral	Well, can you blame her?
joy	Well I dont know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could

neutral	Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it
neutral	Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.

surprise	Hey!
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey, man. What's up?
neutral	Maybe you can tell me.
non-neutral	My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today.
non-neutral	The first good thing she gets me in weeks.

non-neutral	What-what-what-what is it?!
non-neutral	Am I giving out some kind ofsexy professor vibe?
neutral	Not right now.
non-neutral	It-itThe point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
sadness	Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid!
non-neutral	I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard!
neutral	Yknow youI couldnt concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me.
non-neutral	I mean come on, you remember whats its like to be 19 and in love.

neutral	Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm
neutral	G.I. Joe
joy	Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
sadness	It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
disgust	That, that's what's stupid.
neutral	I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers.
neutral	And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
non-neutral	Down at the docks again?
neutral	Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
anger	Im not gonna tell you! Youre the bad man who broke Sarahs leg.

neutral	I know.
sadness	Its hard this whole platonic thing.
surprise	Its a word!
neutral	Yeah, I do think its better this way.  Yeah, were being smart.   Yes, Im sure.
neutral	You really sure?
neutral	Ill call you back.
surprise	So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
neutral	Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
neutral	Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.
neutral	But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary.
neutral	I am
neutral	I think you're better than you think you are.
surprise	Really? Okay, so
neutral	Know when to stop.
neutral	Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?

non-neutral	Who's party is it?
neutral	A woman's
anger	What woman?!
neutral	Chelsea.
neutral	Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here.
disgust	Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet.
disgust	Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle.
non-neutral	So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
non-neutral	Can I be that guy?
joy	Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
non-neutral	Yknow uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
non-neutral	Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!

non-neutral	Who said you were?
anger	You did!
neutral	Oh, Im flaky. Ill say anything.
non-neutral	Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
neutral	That does not sound stupid to me.
neutral	You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?
sadness	I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.
neutral	Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
non-neutral	What uh-oh?
non-neutral	Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done.

anger	Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
disgust	Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
non-neutral	Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
anger	Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
anger	Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
anger	I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
non-neutral	Do not speak ill of the dead.
anger	We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
non-neutral	I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
anger	What did you say?

non-neutral	Oh, come on! I think hes ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
surprise	Really?!
surprise	Hey, yknow what?
neutral	Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, heres-heres 60 bucks, why dont you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
non-neutral	Yknow what? I dont, I dont think Phoebe really wants to come.
joy	No! I do want to!
neutral	Oh, she does want to.

non-neutral	But since you were with Ross, I-I didnt do anything about it.
fear	But, now that youre not, Id really like to ask you out sometime.
fear	So-so thats-thats what Im doing, now.
surprise	Wow! Umm....

sadness	I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
neutral	Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
non-neutral	But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she.
neutral	It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
surprise	You told him to play the boxer gay!!
non-neutral	Well, I-I mightve said supergay.
non-neutral	You totally screwed him over.
anger	Joey, youre this guys teacher. I mean how could you do this?
neutral	Because, Monica, the guys so good, and I really, really want this part.
neutral	Well, if you really, really want it, then its okay.
neutral	Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
non-neutral	Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so
neutral	I'm not your brother.
anger	What about my children Drake?! Huh!?  No!! No!! No! God!

sadness	Ooh, I miss dating.
neutral	Gettin all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant.
joy	Im not gonna be able to do that for so long, and its so much fun!
neutral	I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
neutral	Hey, yknow what?
neutral	Huh?
neutral	Why dont I take you out?
surprise	What?! Joey, you dont want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
joy	Yes I do!
joy	And were gonna go out, were gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out
joy	Okay! Ill go with ya! Ill go! Ill go with ya.
neutral	Ill be fun.
neutral	All right?
joy	Hi!

non-neutral	But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a
sadness	So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
non-neutral	It's over! You
surprise	How can I?
sadness	Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?
sadness	How can I accept that...
sadness	I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.
joy	Kiss me.
surprise	What?
joy	Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
neutral	The bigger half.
joy	I'd like to propose a toast.
joy	Little toast here, ding ding.
joy	I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
non-neutral	Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
joy	So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
joy	That's so sweet.
joy	And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
joy	And a crappy New Year.
joy	Here, here!
anger	Now, hold on!

non-neutral	Shes-shes just a friend and thats all!
non-neutral	Thats all!
non-neutral	Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I cant imagine spending my life with anyone else.
sadness	Please, promise me that youll tell her that.
non-neutral	All right, Ill tell her.  Come on bugger face!
neutral	Call me.
anger	You spend half your life in the bathroom, why dont you ever go out the bloody window!

sadness	Umm ma'am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
surprise	What?
neutral	It's a funny story, actually.
neutral	I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really  know what I was saying.
surprise	You fell asleep?
fear	But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain't that funny?
surprise	Irony?
neutral	Not a fan, alright .
neutral	See, here's  the thing.
neutral	I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go.
joy	See, me, I  love Tulsa!

surprise	That I was not expecting.
neutral	I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
neutral	Oh. Thanks.
joy	No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing
neutral	Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
surprise	I just can't believe you're in here.
sadness	I mean, what am I gonna do without you?
non-neutral	Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?
non-neutral	Who's gonna take me to the

sadness	Oh, I am so sorry.
sadness	No me, I am so sorry...
surprise	Oh my.
fear	Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot.
fear	Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
neutral	Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
neutral	Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
neutral	My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
neutral	No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
neutral	Tho?
non-neutral	Ohhh.
neutral	That's good, have a seat.
neutral	Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle.
neutral	You're just gonna have to be brave, ok?
neutral	Can you do that for me?
neutral	Ok.
neutral	Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?
fear	Yes!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.

anger	Youre a mean old woman.
non-neutral	No! Wait no! Shut upI mean dont cry! Let me get my checkbook!
non-neutral	Look honey, you dont have to do this, okay?
joy	Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me.
joy	Youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity!
joy	Thats the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
anger	That means nothing to me.  Come on!
non-neutral	Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
neutral	: Hey.

joy	Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby!
non-neutral	Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.
neutral	Thank you.
surprise	I dont know how any of these got opened?!
surprise	You opened them all?
non-neutral	I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!
joy	Oh hey! You got my parents gift!
neutral	Yeah. What is that?
non-neutral	Well, I dont know. I think it does something to salami.
non-neutral	Hey! Howd it go?
neutral	Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
non-neutral	Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
joy	I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you.
surprise	Oh wow, you didnt even try to unhook my bra!
neutral	So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
non-neutral	No, I will. Im just not up for it tonight.
non-neutral	Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know youre not gonna be alone in this.

neutral	Yknow?
joy	So,  Rachel Green will you marry me?
neutral	Thank you.

neutral	There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and
neutral	Paris?
neutral	We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .

neutral	Okay, but there
anger	I dont care! The wires have come loose in your head!
neutral	I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
non-neutral	And did you?!
neutral	No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
neutral	But it didnt. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
surprise	Oh my God.
neutral	Hello darling.
neutral	Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.

non-neutral	I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
neutral	Listen.
neutral	As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.
neutral	I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
sadness	I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
neutral	Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
non-neutral	No-no-no-no.  Hey!
neutral	Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
neutral	Hey sweetie.
neutral	Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?

surprise	What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
disgust	Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.

joy	Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars.
joy	She was totally at my mercy.
non-neutral	Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
neutral	No, Im getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie.
non-neutral	She seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.

fear	Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,
non-neutral	Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
neutral	Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me.
neutral	One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
surprise	Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
non-neutral	Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
surprise	All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
neutral	Which proves that I never lie.
neutral	I guess you don't.
non-neutral	Paolo made a pass at me.
fear	Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
neutral	Im not freaking out.
neutral	Why would I be freaking out?
neutral	A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
non-neutral	Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!
neutral	I mean, whats the harm in that?
non-neutral	Right here!
non-neutral	Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel
non-neutral	Phoebe and Rachel!
non-neutral	So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
non-neutral	It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt.
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	Really?
neutral	Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that Im just not ready
neutral	I know! I know.
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	Im gonna go tell Joey that  that youre back. I was really worried about you.
neutral	Hey, did she buy it?
neutral	Totally.
neutral	So did Heldi show you the place?
neutral	Yeah, its beautiful.
joy	I cant believe youre gonna ask Monica to marry you!
neutral	I know.
anger	No Phoebe!
anger	You cannot get the phone that way; thats not fair!
neutral	Okay look, I have an idea.
neutral	Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.
neutral	And then whoever does gets the phone.
neutral	Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
non-neutral	I dont think so.
anger	Fine all right, but Id bet youd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
neutral	All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
sadness	Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
non-neutral	Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
sadness	Did I use that already today? Im sorry.
neutral	Yes okay.
non-neutral	Well now see this isnt telling us anything.
neutral	Joe.
neutral	Carlos.
neutral	Peter.
surprise	Ooh!
surprise	Peter Luger!
non-neutral	T hats a steak house!
neutral	Okay, a meat eater. Fine, thats one for you.
joy	Oh, I win! Hes got
neutral	So you dont know thats
surprise	His new girlfriend!
surprise	I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
non-neutral	I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.
non-neutral	Shes saving the rest for her divorce.
neutral	And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to
neutral	Well what happened at dinner?
non-neutral	My parents spent the money for our wedding!
surprise	My God! What did you order?!
sadness	Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
neutral	Honey, its gonna be okay.
sadness	No! No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
neutral	No, yknow what?
neutral	Its gonna be okay.
neutral	I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast.
neutral	Yknow?
neutral	And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
neutral	Dr. Geller, theres a seat over here.
neutral	Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Im having my lunch at this table, here in the middle.
neutral	Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hell sit with me.
neutral	I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
neutral	Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.
sadness	Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow what I see, I see-I see division.
non-neutral	Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!"
neutral	Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.
joy	Im Ross!
joy	Im divorced, and I have a kid!
joy	Im Joey! Im an actor! I dont know squat about dinosaurs!
non-neutral	Im Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.

neutral	Im Andrew, and I didnt pay for this pear.
non-neutral	Okay, good-good for you.
neutral	Im Rhonda,  and these arent real!
surprise	Wow, Rhonda.
neutral	Im Scott.
neutral	Yeah, okay, Scott!
fear	And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
neutral	So thanks for the warm welcome.
joy	Its good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play.
neutral	I hope you do too.
joy	Now, lets go out there and get em!
surprise	Huh?
neutral	And remember, there is no I in team.
joy	Yes, but theres two in martini, soo everybody

non-neutral	Oh its Bing, sir. Im sorry , I was just ah...
neutral	No-no, I heard what you said, funny.
joy	I like funny.
joy	This team is about hard work, but its also about having fun.
joy	Good to have you aboard Bing!
neutral	Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
neutral	So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
neutral	They're gonna call her Chandler.
neutral	That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
neutral	Works on you.
joy	Oh, that is so sweet.
joy	No, no, ok, you hang up.
joy	Ok, ok, one, two, three.
joy	Well you didn't hang up either.
joy	She didn't hang up either...

surprise	OK, I need to lie down.
joy	Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
joy	Really? That's great!
joy	I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her
neutral	(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of
non-neutral	Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks,
non-neutral	Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one.
non-neutral	Ben is way cuter than that kid.
disgust	I mean look at him, look at you,
neutral	That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
neutral	Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
non-neutral	I look more like him than you do!
non-neutral	Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
joy	That really was some of your best work.
non-neutral	Hm-hmm, I told you!  I cant believe that Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
neutral	I have to be up in seven minutes.
neutral	Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes
surprise	Really?!
neutral	Do you wanna?
joy	Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and Ill get the furniture polish!
neutral	Oh okay. But yknow what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
surprise	Boyfriend?
neutral	No.

neutral	Kristen.
joy	Oh wow, what a beautiful name!  What is it again?
neutral	Kristen.
neutral	Got it!  So
neutral	So uh, do you live around here?
neutral	Yeah!
joy	Yeah!
neutral	Right down there.
neutral	Hey listen; let me give you a little tip.
non-neutral	Do not take a nap on this stoop  or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
neutral	Ill remember that.
neutral	Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
neutral	Oh I, I have plans tonight.
sadness	Oh.
neutral	But how about tomorrow?
joy	Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go?
neutral	You look strong, why dont I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
neutral	Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, Ill grab this one.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Listen, um...
sadness	I'm sorry.
neutral	: Yeah, um...  You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin'
non-neutral	That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
neutral	Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
neutral	If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
non-neutral	Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
sadness	You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
neutral	By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
non-neutral	Oh, hello liar.
sadness	Look, I-Im really sorry I let go of the bike.
anger	I couldve been killed I hope you know!
sadness	I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were
non-neutral	Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
neutral	Phoebe.
anger	What?!  What the hell?!
anger	All right, yknow what?
anger	If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then Im sorry, Im just gonna have to take it back.
surprise	What?! Why?!
anger	Because! Because, it-it-its Itd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar
anger	All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
non-neutral	Great! Great!  Youre making the bike very happy.
non-neutral	Okay Ross!  Please dont die!
non-neutral	How could you have kept all of this from me?
neutral	I was going to tell you, but
anger	But what?! You figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
anger	Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just  Why dont we just let the machine get that?
neutral	Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it.
non-neutral	No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-II need to, I need to lie down.
joy	Everything on your application looks really goodOhh!
non-neutral	Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
neutral	Oh dont worry, Im not really a party girl.
non-neutral	Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
joy	You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! Ill be living here.
non-neutral	Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it.
surprise	Why did you take the shower curtain down?
fear	That thing was a hazard!  Im very safety conscious.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Hey man, how did the audition go?
sadness	Estelle said I didn't get it.
surprise	What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
non-neutral	Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
surprise	No!
neutral	For all I know, shes trying to find me but couldnt because I kept moving around.
neutral	No, from now on, Im staying in one place.
neutral	Right here.
neutral	Well, its getting late.
neutral	Yeah, were gonna go.
neutral	Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
neutral	Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
neutral	Yeah, its a very large plane.
neutral	Thats cool.
neutral	But, well stay here with you.
joy	Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, yknow, but you dont have to rub my butt.
surprise	Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
surprise	Theyre not a couple!
neutral	Oh-okay, I get the game now.
neutral	Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
joy	Oh yeah!
neutral	Well okay, so then youre fine.
neutral	The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.
neutral	Okay?
neutral	So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.
neutral	Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.
surprise	Really?
neutral	Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
neutral	No.
neutral	Noooo!!
surprise	Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, its me! Phoebe!
neutral	Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.
surprise	Wait a second! So, whats new with you?
neutral	Umm, nothing. I mean, Im getting married next week.
surprise	And your breasts! Hmm!!!
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	Umm look, youre coming on a little strong.
neutral	But Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together.
neutral	So, why dont we just start over okay?
neutral	And you can just tell me about yourself.
neutral	All right.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	I write erotic novels, for children.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Theyre wildly unpopular.
disgust	Oh my God!
neutral	Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
surprise	Wow! You do?
joy	Yeah,  a Pretty Huge
disgust	All right.
non-neutral	So, uh, how's she doing?
sadness	The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
non-neutral	How-how are you, Mom?
non-neutral	Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
surprise	What?
surprise	What's different?
neutral	Nothing.
neutral	Oh, maybe that's it.
non-neutral	She is unbelievable, our mother is...
neutral	Okay, relax, relax.
neutral	We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
surprise	Oh God!
neutral	The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
surprise	Oh!
disgust	...Yeah, they were gross.
joy	Oh, you know what I loved?
joy	Her Sweet 'n' Los.
joy	How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
neutral	Not just restaurants, from our house.
neutral	Maybe.
surprise	You can't!
surprise	Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said.
neutral	In the hall.
neutral	Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.
neutral	But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.
neutral	Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
neutral	Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
joy	That's a good one!
neutral	Hey, Joe.
neutral	Dad, Ronni's here.
surprise	Huh?
neutral	So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal.
neutral	Anything at all.
neutral	But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
joy	Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
anger	Im Monicas maid of honor. Okay? Dont try to blue pin me!
neutral	Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.
non-neutral	Limited seating my ass. Lets see who made the cut.  Hi!
neutral	Im Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
non-neutral	Used to work with her. Used to! Im a relative and I didnt get invited! A
non-neutral	Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
joy	So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
neutral	Okay, youre fine.
surprise	Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
neutral	Youll see.
non-neutral	I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
non-neutral	Oh God.
neutral	Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and yknow fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles
neutral	And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and  You go.
neutral	But-but, if you dont love this, well do it in any other place at any other time.
neutral	Really, its fine, whatever you want.
joy	Its perfect.
non-neutral	And, I dont know, if it starts to rain
non-neutral	Well then well get wet.
sadness	Ohh. And I dont even have a date.
neutral	Coming.
anger	I have a bone to pick with you.
fear	Uh-oh.
non-neutral	Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
surprise	Oh yeah? Did he pull the old
joy	Thats right! Thats right!
neutral	Oh that.
anger	Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! Theyre mean and theyre stupid and-and I dont want my son learning them!
anger	Yknow what? It doesnt matter! Because it is not true!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	And if it were true, how
neutral	Ms. Monroe  Oh there you go.
surprise	Mark's a genius!
surprise	Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
non-neutral	Look, don't you see what's happening here.
non-neutral	Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.
neutral	Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
fear	What am I going to do?
neutral	Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.
neutral	All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
fear	I don't know you guys.
disgust	All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.
disgust	And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
non-neutral	And before you know it, she's with him.
non-neutral	And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'
non-neutral	And he'll be all, 'Yes!'
non-neutral	And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'
disgust	And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'
disgust	And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
non-neutral	He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
neutral	This is what Ive got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
neutral	Great. Great.
neutral	Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, Ive got you, me, and Chandler and Im gonna invite Gunther cause, well, weve been talking about this pretty loud.

neutral	Okay! Well need a six-pack of
neutral	Hey guys, what are you doing?

non-neutral	Oh, come on!
neutral	Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him.
neutral	Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there.
neutral	Well, Chandler will be there for you too.
neutral	I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, hell be there.
neutral	And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot.
neutral	What do ya say? What do ya say?
neutral	Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.
neutral	But, all right, I dontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk.
non-neutral	I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to name my kid!
non-neutral	What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
surprise	I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
non-neutral	Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
surprise	What's that supposed to mean?
neutral	Nothing! It's an expression.
neutral	No it's not.
neutral	Don't listen to your mother.
neutral	You're independent, and you always have been!
non-neutral	Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!
neutral	And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
neutral	PBS Telethon.
neutral	Hi Joey.
joy	Hey Pheebs!
neutral	I
surprise	$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what
non-neutral	Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not
surprise	What kind of problem?
non-neutral	Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!
surprise	Oh my God!
non-neutral	Nooooo!
non-neutral	Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
non-neutral	Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
non-neutral	I don't wanna give up the bag.
anger	I don't have to give up the bag!
non-neutral	Do I Rach?
anger	Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
neutral	Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it
surprise	Oh, hey!
non-neutral	I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
non-neutral	I can't believe I'm hearing this!
non-neutral	Wait a minute!
non-neutral	Wait a minute!
neutral	I'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.
neutral	Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
neutral	I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
joy	Okay, great.
neutral	They say he's only got half a tank left.
surprise	Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
non-neutral	We're switching rooms again.
surprise	What? Why?
anger	This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
non-neutral	Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
non-neutral	Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
neutral	Uh-huh.
non-neutral	Chandler!
anger	Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
anger	Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
surprise	Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
joy	Hey!
surprise	Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didnt think you were coming.
joy	Oh, I wouldnt miss this.
joy	Well, Im very glad youre here.
joy	Oh, youre such a gentleman.  Come on! Were going to my place!
joy	Hey!
neutral	Hey-hey.
neutral	So are guys doing okay?
neutral	Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
neutral	Do you have a minute?
neutral	Well yeah, sure, whats up?
non-neutral	I got asked out twice today when I was at lunchby guys.
surprise	Oh really?!
non-neutral	Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
non-neutral	Oh, did you not want people to know that?
non-neutral	But Im not gay. And I especially wouldnt want you to think I was gay.
neutral	Whys that?
neutral	I dont think I should say.
neutral	Ohh, you can say. Come on, I dont want you to feel like you cant tell me things.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Kay.
neutral	Well
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Id love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
neutral	Yeah, shes gay.
neutral	Here you go.
joy	Great! All right, so Ill call you later.
joy	Great!
surprise	Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
neutral	That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.
surprise	Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
neutral	No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
surprise	What?
non-neutral	Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
surprise	Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!
surprise	Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
disgust	Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
non-neutral	What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.
non-neutral	Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.
neutral	But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.
surprise	You got all that from the back of her head?
neutral	All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
neutral	Whos Elaine?
non-neutral	Can you people not see me?!
neutral	So, will you talk to him?
neutral	I dont know Rach.
non-neutral	Oh, come on! Ill give you ten free
anger	One!  No ten! You said ten! You cant take that back!
joy	Hey!
joy	Hi!
neutral	Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?
neutral	We need a porn break.
neutral	We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
non-neutral	Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?
neutral	Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
joy	Ooh, good, youre hear! Okay.
joy	Hey!
joy	Hi!
non-neutral	Well, what-what cha got there?
joy	Oh this, well Im glad you asked.
disgust	Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?
non-neutral	Ahh!
neutral	Now, I know what youre thinking
non-neutral	Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
surprise	Phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they?
non-neutral	No!
neutral	Are you sure?
anger	No!
neutral	Honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
neutral	No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
neutral	Whats the second part of your plan?
neutral	Yes thats right.
surprise	Why?
neutral	I tired attacking two women, did not work.
surprise	What?!
neutral	No, I mean its okay, I mean, theyre-theyre my friends.
non-neutral	In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
non-neutral	Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
surprise	Oh, no!
surprise	No-no!
surprise	No, I tired!
neutral	But I couldnt.
non-neutral	Thats why Im here.
neutral	Maybe we could attack them together?
neutral	That-thats a no.
non-neutral	What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross!
anger	Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross!
anger	I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
non-neutral	All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
non-neutral	No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
neutral	No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
joy	I like that.
neutral	Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
neutral	Huh?
neutral	One swift kick and hell back off.
neutral	All right, bad ankle, got it!
neutral	And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesnt wear a cup.
joy	Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
neutral	And uh, Liam, Liams got bad knees. You hit him right and hell go down like a lamp.
non-neutral	But-but, Liams on my team.
anger	I dont care! You just get him!
joy	Im gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
joy	The Red Ross! Okay.
neutral	Oh!  Oh by the way?
neutral	Uh-hmm.
neutral	James Brolin?
neutral	Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered hes gay.
neutral	Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
surprise	Really?!
neutral	Hello?
neutral	Hello, is Ross there?
neutral	Uh no, hes not. Can I take a message?
neutral	Yes, this Russell, Rosss divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I havent heard from him, I assume hes decided to give the marriage a try.
surprise	Ross got married againNooooooo!!!!!!!!!
non-neutral	Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking!
non-neutral	Oh!  Shes growing inside you.
surprise	Whoa!!
surprise	Oh!
surprise	Wow that was a big one.
non-neutral	I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.
non-neutral	Oh hey you guys!
neutral	Sure, I can hang out til I have to meet ya.  What uhHow come youre not going?
neutral	I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
neutral	I thought you already have a job.
neutral	And people say you dont pay attention.
neutral	No, this is a much better job.
neutral	Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
surprise	Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
neutral	Thats what I do now.
neutral	Hey Joey, come taste this.
neutral	What is it?
anger	Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well  Im getting my revenge!
surprise	You cooked him?
neutral	No.
neutral	He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again.
joy	Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow!
joy	"Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
non-neutral	The front page? You really do live in your own little world, dont ya?
neutral	So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
disgust	No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
sadness	Were never gonna find anybody.
joy	Well then let me do it!
non-neutral	Joe
non-neutral	No-no-no!
neutral	Look, Ive been thinking about it.
neutral	Im an actor right?
neutral	So I wont get nervous talking in front of people.
non-neutral	Joey look its really sweet
non-neutral	No-no-no-no look no!
non-neutral	I wont spit, and I wont stare at Monicas breasts!
neutral	Yknow?
joy	Everyone knows Im an ass man!
neutral	That is true.
joy	Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.
joy	Itll be me!
joy	And I swear Ill do a really good job.
joy	Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
neutral	Yknow, we havent found anybody else.
joy	It might be kinda cool.
joy	So I can do it?
joy	Ah-ha! Too cocky!
non-neutral	I still cant believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
neutral	Of course I do! And Im gonna give it back to you as soon as theyre done with it at the key shining place.
non-neutral	What the hell is that?
surprise	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
neutral	You said there was a gas leak in here.
neutral	Well why dont you use your key?
neutral	Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded.
neutral	If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions.
anger	Come on!
non-neutral	Hurry up.
neutral	Oh! We could have done that.
neutral	Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about.
sadness	Oh, Im so sorry.
non-neutral	Um, and maybe Im wrong!
neutral	I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more.
surprise	You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him?
neutral	Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat.
neutral	(walking up with this
non-neutral	God Ross, what is that?
non-neutral	Oh, but its made her so happy.
neutral	Little girl misses her cat.
non-neutral	Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.
neutral	Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Thank you.
neutral	I
non-neutral	He is right, isnt he?
neutral	Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong.
surprise	You think?
neutral	Oh-no, hes right.
joy	Seven hundred bucks!
joy	Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
non-neutral	Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
neutral	Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
disgust	What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
neutral	Oh.
neutral	Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
neutral	Me too.
neutral	Although this city is my home, so.
neutral	So thats dumb what I said, dont tell him I said that.
neutral	Umm, you make something up.
joy	Nice,  thank you.
neutral	This is me.
neutral	Here.
non-neutral	Your eyes are very pretty.
joy	Thank you, very much! Oh!  Thank you!
neutral	He would like to kiss you.
neutral	Okay, y'know what, you dont have to do that now.
non-neutral	No-no-no-no!!
surprise	Not him, you dont!
neutral	Well the moments over.
neutral	Oh.
non-neutral	Oy!
non-neutral	Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
neutral	Id really prefer a mountain bike.
neutral	Janices birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
surprise	Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa.
non-neutral	Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
disgust	Thats a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. I would like to get her something serious.
neutral	Oh, you want something serious.
neutral	Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas.
neutral	Those are dead serious.
non-neutral	All right. Look, Im gonna go in here, and you dont buy me anything ever.
fear	No, no, you cant, you cant, okay, you cant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, you cant.
surprise	Why not?!
neutral	Oh God. Uh, okay, heres the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
non-neutral	What is the thing?
non-neutral	Okay. I went down to the Mattress King showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.

sadness	Well she, she wouldnt do that, shes with, shes with me.

joy	Oh thats great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please?  There we go.
non-neutral	Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
neutral	How are you feeling?
neutral	You are
non-neutral	I really wish that you wouldnt.
neutral	Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?
neutral	Then we can put you in bed, okay?
neutral	Just smile and dont talk to
joy	Speech! Speech! Lets hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
non-neutral	Pheebs!!
joy	Dont you see? Everyones looking at me! The plans working! I didnt even have to take off my top yet!
joy	Speech! Come on Monica!
joy	Come on!
joy	Come on! Speech!
non-neutral	Hey Chandler, you cant keep your hands off her for one second!
joy	Oh-ho, I think its nice.
neutral	Well you have to because maybe its stupid.
joy	Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
non-neutral	Oh crap!
neutral	All right.
neutral	The super couldnt figure out what it did.
non-neutral	A $200 an hour electrician couldnt figure out what it did.
non-neutral	Ive had seven pretty serious shocks.
disgust	I officially give up.
joy	Thank God.
non-neutral	I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
non-neutral	See? Im doing it. I am totally doing it.  I lost it.
non-neutral	Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
neutral	He doesn't have anyone.
non-neutral	Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
disgust	I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
joy	Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
neutral	Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
neutral	You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
neutral	Y'know, we don't have to watch this.
non-neutral	No way, forget it.
non-neutral	C'mon, she's your mom!
neutral	Exactly.
joy	Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books!
joy	I love her books!
joy	I cannot get on a plane without one!
joy	I mean, this is so cool!
disgust	Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
joy	C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
neutral	Thank you.
neutral	And a nice hot cider for Monica.
neutral	Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?
neutral	Yeah?
surprise	Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
surprise	Oh! That's why.  I'm sorry!
neutral	Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
neutral	Yes?
non-neutral	You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
neutral	Yeah I can, it worked real well.
anger	No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.

neutral	Yknow, theres
neutral	Show me where?
neutral	Right-right up here.
neutral	Joey wheres the pipe that was holding the door open?
non-neutral	I dont know!   Yeah, I do.
anger	Joey!
anger	What?! All rightHey! Dont look at me! Youre the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid
anger	Its called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!

neutral	Hi.. how was the game?
neutral	Well..
joy	WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
surprise	Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
neutral	Alan.
joy	He was unbelievable.
joy	He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
joy	I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
joy	Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
neutral	Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
surprise	What?
neutral	..I dunno, a little too Alan?
non-neutral	Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
non-neutral	Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
joy	I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
joy	Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, thats the first A Ive gotten since seventh grade,
non-neutral	Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
surprise	What the hell!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	All right, lets start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
disgust	Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
surprise	My God!
surprise	These pants are burning up!
surprise	Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!
non-neutral	What is she trying to kill me?
surprise	It's like a volcano in here!
neutral	Are you hot?
neutral	Okay, it must just be me then.
neutral	That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
anger	You're driving me crazy with that!
neutral	Okay, I'll stop.
non-neutral	Dont stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
non-neutral	Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
neutral	You wanna play?
neutral	Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon.
neutral	And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
neutral	Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
joy	All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
non-neutral	I'm intrigued.
neutral	All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
non-neutral	Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
non-neutral	Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
neutral	Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
neutral	Uh yeah, right here.
joy	Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
neutral	What's that?
neutral	Weeeell, it's rum, and-
neutral	I'm sure they'll be here soon.
neutral	Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
neutral	Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
fear	You are really frightening me.
fear	Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?
neutral	All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
neutral	All right, honey, time to start pushing.
fear	But they're not here yet!
neutral	I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
fear	Oh, god.
non-neutral	Here we go. Mona umm, I think its time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
neutral	Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
non-neutral	Aw, we-we are so So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, yknow hanging out with you.
joy	And I mean-Im having a lot of fun.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if its just fun.
non-neutral	Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right?
neutral	So where-where is it going?
surprise	Ah!
neutral	Thats-thats the real question.
joy	And-and the answer isis its going somewherefun.
neutral	Now I-I know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger.
fear	No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou
non-neutral	Im sorry, so umm, so where are we?
neutral	Yknow what?
joy	I am going to take you out to dinner tonight.
joy	I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .
non-neutral	No?
surprise	Really?
joy	They taste so good.
neutral	Drum roll.
neutral	Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
neutral	Nah, youre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
neutral	All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
surprise	Youre actually going through with this?
non-neutral	Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.
neutral	Okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
non-neutral	You got problems because of you!
non-neutral	Not your name!
anger	All right, this has got to stop!
anger	Chandler is a great name!
non-neutral	In factyes,  Im, Im sorry.
neutral	I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, Im-Im, Im gonna, Im gonna name the baby Chandler.
surprise	Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
neutral	It was.
sadness	Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, thats not gonna be me, not me.
surprise	Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
neutral	No.
surprise	Whoa. That was really good.
neutral	Thanks, any suggestions?
non-neutral	Hi!
surprise	You-youyou had sex with Ursula?!
fear	Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and
surprise	You didnt notice she was wearing different clothes?!
non-neutral	Well I was just so excited to see you.
disgust	Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird.
non-neutral	No-no its not!
fear	I dont want to lose you!
non-neutral	Its-its like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was youYeah it is too weird.
non-neutral	So I guess this is it.
non-neutral	Yeah.  Maybe its for the best. You smell just like her.
non-neutral	Yeah, so do you.
joy	Hey!
neutral	Hi.
neutral	So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
sadness	Manhattan does not have enough stores.
neutral	Well,
surprise	You can?
neutral	Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
neutral	Um-hmm.
neutral	And a small piece of chocolate.
neutral	Okay.
sadness	Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship
non-neutral	I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
non-neutral	Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
non-neutral	Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
non-neutral	I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
surprise	Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?
neutral	No! No! Not, Paris.
joy	Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
non-neutral	Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. Thats right, yes, Im being transferred to Yemen!
non-neutral	When?
neutral	I dont know exactly.
sadness	Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
non-neutral	But I do know that its some time tomorrow.
joy	Ooh, this is it!  Oh, thats him! Thats him!
joy	Great! Go get him.
neutral	Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
neutral	Hes not really my type.
neutral	No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see whats he like. People tell doctors everything.
surprise	But you said he was this great guy!
sadness	But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
sadness	You do attract some stinkers.
neutral	Chandler.
neutral	Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a
neutral	Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
neutral	Oh, listen.
neutral	If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them.
non-neutral	Really.
neutral	Nothing at all.
non-neutral	Really.
neutral	Nothing.
neutral	Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
non-neutral	Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one?
non-neutral	No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.
neutral	Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out?
non-neutral	No, no, I keep trying, yknow?
sadness	I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "go to the bathroom."
neutral	He may think Im sick.
neutral	Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with!
neutral	Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them.
neutral	Okay?
neutral	Thats it.
non-neutral	Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna order me around all the time?
neutral	Pretty much.
neutral	All right.
joy	Hey Monica!
joy	Hi!
neutral	Hey man, you feeling any better?
neutral	Joey, we have something to tell you.
surprise	Oh my God! Youre pregnant!
neutral	Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, youre only married in Vegas.
neutral	What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youre married everywhere.
surprise	Really?!
neutral	Yeah!
surprise	Oh my God!Eh! Well
disgust	You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave hes going straight to the porn.
neutral	Hes gonna go up to the counter with
neutral	Yeah.
non-neutral	I missed this.
non-neutral	Me too.
neutral	So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
joy	Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
anger	Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
neutral	We will.
neutral	Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
neutral	No Mon,
neutral	Every year.
neutral	And
joy	Hey! Ross!
neutral	Die Hard
neutral	Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?

joy	And itll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
neutral	Die Hard
neutral	Dude, you didnt say
neutral	Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
non-neutral	Well, John McClane had plans!
neutral	No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
non-neutral	What are you talking about? Bitch.
non-neutral	I know you botched that operation on purpose.
anger	I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder.
disgust	I don't care if you    are my brother.
joy	Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch!
anger	Stop going through my stuff !
joy	Hey!
joy	Hey!
non-neutral	I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
fear	No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
non-neutral	Please, what about you and Chandler?
non-neutral	That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
non-neutral	Well hello !
non-neutral	What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?
anger	I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
non-neutral	Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
non-neutral	I'm gonna do it.
neutral	And I can't stop you.
neutral	No.
neutral	Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
neutral	I'm smarter than
non-neutral	Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
joy	Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
neutral	Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im heading up there.
neutral	Uh, yeah, Ill take a coffee. Thanks, man.
non-neutral	Sure.  Coffee? Cause Im going up there.
neutral	No.
neutral	No, thank you.
neutral	You guys need anything, cause Im heading up there.
neutral	Id love an ice water.
neutral	You got it.
surprise	Joey, what are you doing?
non-neutral	Just being friendly.
non-neutral	Joey, honey, I dont think youre supposed to go back there.
neutral	Nah, its okay. Right, Gunther?
non-neutral	Dont wink at me. And put on your apron.
non-neutral	Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
surprise	Joey, do you work here?
neutral	No.
neutral	Hey, waiter.
neutral	Yeah?
neutral	Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening.  Yeah we are.
neutral	Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.
neutral	Im calling for Monica Geller.
neutral	I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
surprise	This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!!
neutral	Thank you.
neutral	Thanks.
non-neutral	I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
neutral	Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am
non-neutral	This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
neutral	So go fix it!
neutral	Go find Chandler!
non-neutral	He's probably up in your room!
non-neutral	Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
joy	Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
joy	Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
neutral	Anybody lose this?
joy	Comin' out. Place your bet.  Dice are out.  Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
neutral	Hmm.
neutral	Do you remember where the duck food is?
surprise	Yeah, its in the guys apartment under the sink. Why?
neutral	Because Im going to London.
surprise	What?! What do you mean youre going to London?
neutral	Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.
neutral	Now honey, you take care, you dont have those babies until I get back.
non-neutral	IRachel, you cant go! Ross loves Emily!
non-neutral	Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does.
non-neutral	But I have to tell him how I feel!
neutral	He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
non-neutral	Thats not why youre going!
non-neutral	Youre going because you hope hes gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach.
non-neutral	Forget that British chippy."
surprise	OhhDo you think he will?!
non-neutral	No!
non-neutral	Because hes in love with the British chippy!
non-neutral	Look, Rachel, if you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!
anger	Yknow, its too late!
sadness	You missed youre chance!
sadness	Im sorry, I know this must be really hard, its over.
non-neutral	Yknow what? No. Its not over until someone says, "I do."
non-neutral	I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. Im carrying a litter.
neutral	So is everybody here?
neutral	I got here a little early myself.
neutral	Let us begin.
neutral	Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.
neutral	Here.
neutral	Here.
neutral	Now as for the hydrosaurs
neutral	Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night.
sadness	Ive ah, Ive recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry.
sadness	So, do you think you can forgive me?
joy	Great.
joy	Thanks.
neutral	Okay, bye.
neutral	Hello, Jennifer?
surprise	Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there?
surprise	Oh, shes not home huh?
neutral	Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
non-neutral	Hey!
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Are you all right?
fear	Uhh… I think I just got engaged.
surprise	Oh my God! He did it?
non-neutral	Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?
surprise	Are you kidding?
non-neutral	I'm like the one who talked him into it.
non-neutral	I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
non-neutral	And you really think this is a good idea?
neutral	I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people.
non-neutral	I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.
surprise	Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so.
surprise	Really?! Even Ross?
joy	Especially Ross!
neutral	Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come  back later.
surprise	Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just…I'll  come back.
joy	There he goes, your fiancée.
neutral	I guess so.
neutral	Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
neutral	I can't say that I'm surprised.
sadness	Oh, that is so unfortunate.
neutral	What?
non-neutral	Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
neutral	Okay, Ill be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe Im sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
neutral	You didnt leave lipstick marks on the phone.
neutral	Oh, then it mustve been you. Bye.
non-neutral	Bye-bye!  Thats why I moved out.
neutral	Hey, y'know while were on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you dont live here anymore.
neutral	I think on some levels she already knows.
neutral	Night Mon. Night Julio.
neutral	Adios.
surprise	Look Julio, someone left their book here.
neutral	Ah actually, that is mine.
neutral	Oh yeah, what are you reading?
neutral	Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
neutral	Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?
neutral	I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
neutral	Your a poet and don't know it.
neutral	Actually I ah, I am a poet.
neutral	Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?
neutral	Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
neutral	Mine?  Right here?
joy	I can write an epic poem about this lip.
joy	How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
neutral	Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
surprise	What?
neutral	I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
surprise	What?
neutral	Were at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
surprise	Are we really in Montreal?!
neutral	Yes we are. So, coffee?
non-neutral	Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
neutral	Oh, no. But its just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
neutral	Okay, heres batch 22.
non-neutral	Oh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers.
neutral	This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
neutral	Lets give it a shot.
neutral	Okay. Man, I have
surprise	Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
neutral	No, just a Friday night.
neutral	Would she?
anger	Would she?  You ate my candy bar!
disgust	Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
sadness	I know honey, Im sorry.
sadness	Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in.
non-neutral	Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
sadness	Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt....
disgust	I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
anger	Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
fear	Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
anger	Its not funny, this is actually my job.
neutral	Oh believe me, I-I-Ive been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
non-neutral	Oh well then, so Im just going to go back to talking to my friend here.
non-neutral	And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
neutral	Ah, just one other thing.
non-neutral	Yes?!
neutral	I ah, I work at

neutral	Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
surprise	Why?
neutral	Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
surprise	Oh my God.
neutral	Phoebe.
non-neutral	Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
joy	Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.
non-neutral	He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
joy	We should do something. Whistle.
non-neutral	We are not going to whistle.
neutral	Come on, do it.
non-neutral	No!
joy	Do it!
non-neutral	No!
joy	Do it do it do it!
joy	Woo-woo!
surprise	I can't believe you did that!
neutral	Hi! Umm, Im Monica Geller, Im the chef at Alessandros.
surprise	Still?
non-neutral	I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
non-neutral	I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
anger	Either eat it, or be in it.
non-neutral	Spoon?  So, what do you think?
disgust	Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.
non-neutral	Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; theres a new class comin in.
neutral	Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
neutral	I can.
neutral	Okay, go ahead.
neutral	Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
neutral	Thats very good, whats your name?
neutral	Monica.
neutral	Monica, you go to the head of the class.
joy	Okay.
neutral	And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,    it's a place I've never seeeeen.
neutral	But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen.
neutral	Humaaan spleeeeen.
joy	Olè!
surprise	What are you doing here!
joy	Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain!
joy	Great!
joy	Yeah!
joy	It really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs!
non-neutral	Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
non-neutral	Listen Phoebe...
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but...
neutral	But what?
neutral	This is kind of a classy place.
neutral	Ok, say no more.
non-neutral	I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
neutral	Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
non-neutral	Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
non-neutral	Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
neutral	I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention
neutral	Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
non-neutral	We can't. We're not pharmacists!
neutral	I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba...
neutral	Kate Miller?
neutral	Kate Miller it is.
non-neutral	And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
neutral	In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
neutral	Thank you.
surprise	Oh my God!
sadness	We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
non-neutral	This year was supposed to be great!
disgust	But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
sadness	No. No, you're not a loser.
non-neutral	Look at me!
joy	Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
non-neutral	Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
joy	See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
joy	Yeah!
joy	That really is something; that's really cool.
joy	Howdy partner!
joy	Maybe I should get another pair!
joy	Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.
joy	I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.
non-neutral	I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
joy	I would make a good cowboy.
neutral	Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
neutral	Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.
non-neutral	No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
surprise	Oh yeah!
neutral	Great nap.
neutral	It really was.
non-neutral	Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.
neutral	So, lets talk about women. Im sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.
neutral	Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin?"
disgust	Oh, please!
neutral	Hey, how you doin?

neutral	Hey P
neutral	What are you doing?
neutral	Setting rat traps.
surprise	To kill Bob??
neutral	No, no, to test his neck strength.
non-neutral	No, Mike, I don't want to kill him!
non-neutral	I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
neutral	Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
neutral	I'll find Bob, I'll get him.
fear	Bob?
non-neutral	Bob!
non-neutral	Robert!
non-neutral	Oh wait, I think I hear him.
surprise	Oh - Oh my god!
surprise	Bob    had babies!
surprise	Bob's a mom!
non-neutral	Better think of a new name for him.
neutral	I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
neutral	I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ...
non-neutral	Oh my god, we killed Bob!
neutral	Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
neutral	Suzie?
joy	Hmmm, soup!

neutral	Oh yeah, no problem.
neutral	Thanks.
sadness	Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection.
surprise	Joey!
surprise	What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
anger	Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!
anger	So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.
anger	I said, "No!"
neutral	Which puts

neutral	Okay?
neutral	I think this can go somewhere.
neutral	So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?

surprise	What?
neutral	Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
non-neutral	Its over.
non-neutral	Oh, was it awful?
non-neutral	Well, it was loong.
neutral	I didnt even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 oclock shadow on her head.
sadness	Anyway, she didnt want to stay.
neutral	I called a cab; she just left.
neutral	I wrote you a letter.
joy	Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
neutral	Its just some things Ive been thinking about.
neutral	Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
neutral	Okay.  Wow, its-its 5:30 in the morning.  So, Id better get cracking on this baby.
neutral	Well, Ill be waiting for you, just come up when youre done.
non-neutral	Okay, Ill be up in,  18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
non-neutral	The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
neutral	Well, you said that we except the
neutral	All right, that Ill retract.
disgust	But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasnt it.
disgust	Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice!
disgust	You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
anger	Hey! Im proud of that sauce, its delicious.
surprise	Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
neutral	Lebanon.
non-neutral	Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
neutral	How long is this gonna take? Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
neutral	Okay, then what happened?
non-neutral	Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn!
neutral	Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
anger	Nothing!   This is not over!
anger	No! No! No!

sadness	Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
surprise	Really?

neutral	That's okay, Joe.
neutral	All right, let's go Pheebs.
surprise	Oh God!
joy	That was amazing.
neutral	I know.
joy	Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?

neutral	Right?
non-neutral	We just broke up, first thing she does!
neutral	You didnt just break up.

surprise	How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
neutral	Hes talking to the baby.
surprise	Ohh!
surprise	Okay!
surprise	Okay, cause when-when he said, "I cant wait to hear your first words," I thought, "Theres a trick."

joy	If he goes first he can!
surprise	Hey!
non-neutral	Yeah!

neutral	Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
joy	Oh wow thats a great idea! And
neutral	Here you go.
non-neutral	Oh.
joy	Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one.
neutral	Here you go.

non-neutral	All the time?
non-neutral	All the time!
neutral	Cassie, how you-how you doin on thathot dog.
neutral	Im all done.
joy	Thank God.
neutral	I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
neutral	Oh right.
neutral	Right.
joy	Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you til you cried?
sadness	Were probably too old to do that now.
joy	Ill always remember that summer, because its when I got all of these freckles.
joy	Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and Ill always remember that summer because thats when I realized that we are related.
surprise	It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
neutral	Well Im, Im a little slow.  Just as our children would be.
neutral	Relax every muscle in your body.
neutral	Listen to the plinky-plunky music.
neutral	Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place.
neutral	Okay, tell me your happy place.
joy	Richard's living room, drinking wine.
anger	All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
non-neutral	I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
neutral	Well, okay, fine, use my happy place.
neutral	Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
neutral	All right, I'll try not to.
neutral	Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
sadness	Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
joy	All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
sadness	I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
neutral	All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place.
neutral	Okay.
joy	Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains.
neutral	And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
disgust	Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
neutral	OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
neutral	See you later Rach.
neutral	Bye-bye Julie.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey.
non-neutral	Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
neutral	Hey?
neutral	What?
neutral	Can I ask you somethin'?
non-neutral	Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
neutral	Ok.
neutral	Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
neutral	What's up?
neutral	F.Y.I..
neutral	I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons.
neutral	Her name is Stephanie... something.
neutral	She's supposed to be very good.
surprise	But what about Phoebe?
disgust	Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
sadness	Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
neutral	Uh...
non-neutral	Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
non-neutral	Ahh, no.
neutral	Oh.
surprise	Are you jealous?
non-neutral	Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all.
non-neutral	I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
non-neutral	You are totally jealous.
non-neutral	I'm not jealous.
neutral	All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers.
neutral	And y'know, and um, I...
neutral	Honey, I love you too.
non-neutral	Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
surprise	What?
surprise	Huh.
non-neutral	Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
neutral	Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
surprise	I cant believe you came back.
non-neutral	Dont say anything.
neutral	I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna think.
joy	I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
joy	Rachel! Rachel!
neutral	What?
surprise	You missed the exit!
neutral	Oh, sorry.
surprise	My God, what were you thinking about?
neutral	Um,  Barry.
non-neutral	Awwww!!
surprise	I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
non-neutral	Dude!
joy	And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.
surprise	God!
non-neutral	All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
neutral	Well actually, Ross doesn't.
neutral	Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
neutral	Dear Mary-Angela.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Hows it going.
non-neutral	This is the hardest letter Ive ever had to write.
disgust	What the hells a matter with you?
non-neutral	How do you think Joeys going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
neutral	Well, thats the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually Ill be in Cuba.
neutral	All right, look, look, youve got to do this yourself, okay in person.
neutral	At least you know her name.
neutral	You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
non-neutral	What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
non-neutral	Where in Cuba?
neutral	Hey.
non-neutral	You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
surprise	Oh! I knew it! What happened?
non-neutral	Umm, she kissed me.
surprise	What?! You kissed!
neutral	All right.
neutral	Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?
neutral	A two and a five.
joy	Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
surprise	Really?!
neutral	Oh yeah! Okay, lets play again.  What do you got?
neutral	A four and a nine.
surprise	Youre kidding right?
neutral	No. Why?
surprise	Well thats a full cup!
joy	Damn! I am good at Cups!
surprise	What? Why? Where are you?
neutral	Im still on the set!
non-neutral	Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
non-neutral	I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go until we get this.
non-neutral	Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister.
non-neutral	No! No, Im the minister! Alright, look-look, put em both on the phone, Ill marry them right now.
non-neutral	Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
anger	Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I have the power!
non-neutral	Oh hey Joey! What's up?
neutral	I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
neutral	Yeah, I've been around.
neutral	Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
neutral	Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.
surprise	Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees!
neutral	Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.
joy	Great! Problem solved!
non-neutral	Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
neutral	All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
surprise	Why?
non-neutral	Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
anger	Bastard!
surprise	You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping orOh!
surprise	All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
non-neutral	Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
surprise	Oh!
surprise	Oh, I can't believe it!
joy	I mean I think it's great!
neutral	For him.
neutral	She might be able to do better.
neutral	Hey guys!
neutral	Joey! Come here! Come here!
surprise	What? What?
neutral	Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
neutral	You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
neutral	No. Joey, she
surprise	Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
neutral	Yes, but y'know what?
neutral	It doesn't matter who knows what.
neutral	Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!
joy	Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
neutral	It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
neutral	Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta change things.
surprise	You really think it would be that different?
surprise	How could it not be?
sadness	I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
sadness	And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a
neutral	Well, things change.
sadness	I dont want them to move to a
neutral	Itll be okay Joe.
surprise	Its still there!
neutral	Mrs. Braverman must be out.
non-neutral	She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.
fear	By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
fear	No that could kill her.
neutral	Well, we dont want that.
neutral	No, so were protecting her.
neutral	But we should take it.
non-neutral	But we should move quick.
surprise	Why?
non-neutral	Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
fear	Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
neutral	Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
neutral	Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
neutral	Well, you're gonna.
neutral	I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
neutral	Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
neutral	Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.
non-neutral	And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?
neutral	Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
neutral	Hey, you're not him.
neutral	You're you.
neutral	When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
neutral	No.
neutral	No.
neutral	You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.
non-neutral	Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!
neutral	And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
non-neutral	You really think so?
neutral	Yeah. I really do.
neutral	Thanks, Chandler.
non-neutral	Get off!
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
neutral	When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
neutral	And the cream?
neutral	Cheese makes me thirsty.
neutral	Okay. Lets move on.
neutral	All right.
surprise	Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! Youve never made this before?
surprise	Oh no!
neutral	I dont know anything about cooking.
neutral	I had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
joy	Well, hats off to the chef.
neutral	I-I-Im sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didnt hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
joy	The chef!
joy	Thats right.
neutral	Hey, Pheebs.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	How's it going?
non-neutral	Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
neutral	So what's going on?
neutral	Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
neutral	I dunno, there's just something about...
neutral	Basically we just feel that he's...
disgust	We hate that guy.
disgust	Yeah. Hate him.
sadness	We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
neutral	Uh-huh.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
disgust	...No, we hate him.
sadness	We're sorry.
joy	Hey!
joy	Hey!
neutral	What are you doing?
neutral	Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
non-neutral	Yes that was mine.
non-neutral	'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
non-neutral	Yes that would have made more sense.
anger	Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!
neutral	All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time.
neutral	And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.
non-neutral	Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?
surprise	!
non-neutral	Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
non-neutral	Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
surprise	She said what?
neutral	She said, "If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
non-neutral	Postpone it?
non-neutral	Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?
non-neutral	Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?
neutral	This isnt right.
non-neutral	I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure theyll come back when we can do it right.
non-neutral	I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
anger	Dont you point your pants at me!
anger	We have no choice!
non-neutral	Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross dont you understand?
non-neutral	This is our wedding Im talking about.
neutral	The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when were getting married.
non-neutral	So what are you saying? Its now or never?
neutral	No. Im saying its now.
non-neutral	Or?
non-neutral	Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
non-neutral	Its not the pants.
non-neutral	Its you that is backwards.
anger	And if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all!
sadness	No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please
neutral	Hi, honey.
neutral	See you later.
non-neutral	What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
anger	Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
neutral	Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller.
surprise	Oh no!
neutral	I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
non-neutral	Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!!
surprise	This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
anger	NOOOO!!!!!!!!
surprise	Ma! What're you doing here?
neutral	I came to give you this  and this.
surprise	Oww! Big ring!
neutral	Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
non-neutral	Do you uh, do you talk about me?
neutral	Yeah, yeah, all the time.
surprise	Really?
neutral	But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
disgust	Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
disgust	Have you ever seen so much crap?
non-neutral	Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
neutral	Check this out. Can I have this?
neutral	What?
neutral	I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.
neutral	All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.
non-neutral	It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
sadness	If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
joy	Fortunately, it is me.
joy	And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.
joy	Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate.
neutral	Y'know, someplace nice.
neutral	Yeah, someplace nice.
joy	Yeah!
non-neutral	How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
neutral	So, what do you think?
joy	I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
joy	I know!
neutral	So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
joy	Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
joy	Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!
surprise	Whats this?
neutral	Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
neutral	Gotcha.
neutral	This place is really my Grandmothers.
neutral	I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.
neutral	So if the landlord ever asks, Im 87 year old woman, whos afraid of her VCR.
neutral	So are you thirsty?
non-neutral	Oh, you bet I am!
non-neutral	Okay, heres your penis!
joy	Hey!
joy	Hey!
joy	Hey!
neutral	How was your first day?
neutral	Ohh, okay.
joy	Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
neutral	Thank you, its my moms. So this is the kitchen.
neutral	Hey, ready for dinner?
joy	Ooh, absolutely!
joy	Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
neutral	Ooh, I love that place!  So, no.
neutral	How about Mama Lisettie's?
neutral	Enh. Sure!
disgust	I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out.
neutral	Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!
neutral	Thatthis milk is mine.
neutral	I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.
joy	Okay, let's go!
non-neutral	Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the
neutral	But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
disgust	Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
anger	Okay, stop!
neutral	Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?
non-neutral	Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
neutral	Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
non-neutral	Thank you.
non-neutral	Okay, go!
neutral	Go!
non-neutral	Go!
disgust	Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
non-neutral	No! No! Phoebe, come on! I dont want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
joy	No but at Monicas you can eat cookies over the sink!
sadness	I know. Im sorry.
neutral	All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	God, what a mess.
neutral	Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
sadness	Well, I lost.
sadness	Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.
non-neutral	Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
joy	Hey! Howd the interview go?
sadness	Oh, I blew it. I wouldnt of even hired me.
sadness	Oh, come here sweetie, listen, youre gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.
sadness	Thats not how that was supposed to come out.
sadness	This is the worst Christmas ever.
neutral	Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
anger	I cant!
anger	Its too late!
sadness	Terry already hired that girl over there.
sadness	Look at her, shes even got waitress experience.
sadness	Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.
neutral	That word was swans.
surprise	What do we got there?
surprise	A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
joy	You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
neutral	It's all right.
neutral	It's all right.
neutral	You don't have to explain.
neutral	This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
neutral	You're our third call tonight.
surprise	Really?
neutral	Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
sadness	I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
neutral	No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
joy	Thank God. Food.
neutral	Phoebe?
neutral	What?
neutral	Do you have a plan?
non-neutral	I don't even have a 'pl'.
non-neutral	No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
surprise	Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
surprise	Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
non-neutral	Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
non-neutral	And-and a power tie?
surprise	Oh God.

non-neutral	Well, its about time.

disgust	I ate a bug.
non-neutral	Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Lets stock up.
fear	Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we dont know where we are, so we cant get a tow truck.
non-neutral	Oh, now you want a favour?
neutral	Yes, please.
anger	Well, oh, Im sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but Im a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
neutral	Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
non-neutral	No, Im not gonna pick them up.
neutral	Listen, we both know youre gonna do it cause youre not a jerk.
neutral	Okay?
non-neutral	So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
non-neutral	No, Rachel doesnt want me to....
neutral	Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but dont punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
neutral	Yeah, youre right.
sadness	God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
sadness	Oh, I know.
sadness	I kinda feel like it's my fault.
anger	Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
anger	Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
non-neutral	Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
neutral	All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
non-neutral	Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?

non-neutral	Is this because of the burrito thing?
neutral	You need to give him money.
surprise	Give him money? It was a joke!
non-neutral	No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
neutral	Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
neutral	You've got to be smooth about it.
neutral	Hey, I can be smooth.
neutral	Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
neutral	Of course, sir.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Id better get back to my desk.
joy	Okay, you hard worker! Ill remember to put that in your evaluation.

neutral	But yknow, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
surprise	Are you serious?
neutral	No, Ive just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
neutral	I can blow dry it.
neutral	I can put gel on it.
neutral	It doesnt matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head.
disgust	Its so annoying.
non-neutral	Does it bug you?
disgust	You bug me.
neutral	Is there any chance you didnt see that?

surprise	Okay, look Im sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldnt have, but you got porn!
anger	Hey-hey, yknow what?
anger	I dont care!
non-neutral	Im not ashamed of my book.
neutral	Theres nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a littleerotica.
non-neutral	Its just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
non-neutral	You got porn!
joy	Well, I feel like a snack!
neutral	Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are.
neutral	Oh no thanks. I dont like
surprise	What?!
sadness	Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.

non-neutral	No!
non-neutral	No-no theyre not.

anger	Come on!
non-neutral	I dont wanna make any mistakes, alright?
fear	This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?
neutral	So why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
joy	Oh I am!
anger	Ross, if you dont tell them, then I will!
non-neutral	Okay, fine!

joy	Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
joy	Okay, now you're even cuter!!
neutral	Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
surprise	What?
surprise	The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
surprise	What are you talking about?
joy	I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
non-neutral	That's not possible!
surprise	Ow!
non-neutral	I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
non-neutral	Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
sadness	I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
anger	No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
surprise	This bicep?
non-neutral	Well it's not flexed right now!
neutral	It's Phoebe.
sadness	Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
sadness	Umm, well, umm Grandma died.

surprise	Yeah? You like that one?
joy	Yeah, youre funny.
surprise	Im funny?

neutral	Heres a good one.
neutral	Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge.
neutral	Right?
neutral	And then you say to person, I bet you cant roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face.
neutral	And then when they do it, theyre left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
neutral	Can I do it to you?
non-neutral	Yeah, I-I-I-Im funny Ben, but Im not stupid. Okay?

neutral	Isnt he an architect now?
neutral	Yeah, they still wear underwear.
neutral	So the Porsche guy took his car back.
neutral	But you found the keys to his clothes?
non-neutral	No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
surprise	And people will think you own a Porsche because youre wearing the clothes?
surprise	Really?!
non-neutral	Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.

disgust	They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
neutral	Come on, they were not that huge.
disgust	I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain.
surprise	How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
neutral	Hold it, hold it.
neutral	I gotta side with Chandler on this one.
disgust	When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple.
disgust	It made me nuts.
neutral	You or me?
non-neutral	I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
surprise	You guys are messing with me, right?
neutral	Yeah.
non-neutral	That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
non-neutral	Oh my God, hes lost it. Hes totally lost it.
surprise	What?
neutral	Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
joy	Youre a genius!

neutral	Uhh.
non-neutral	Ah AhGet out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marions views on evolution?
neutral	Uh, actually I find Marions views far too progressionist.
neutral	I find Marions views far too progressionist.
surprise	Im sorry, who are you?
neutral	Im a professor here uh, RossGeller.
surprise	Ross Geller, why do I know that name? Its uhWait!  Did you write this?
surprise	Yes! Youre the person who checked out my book?!
surprise	Yknow, you look nothing like I wouldve thought. Youreyoure so young.
neutral	Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
anger	You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
surprise	What?
anger	I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
anger	Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
non-neutral	The point is I...
anger	I don't need this right now, OK.
non-neutral	It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy.
non-neutral	This ship has sailed.
non-neutral	Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
anger	Fine.

anger	Good.
anger	Good.
joy	Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.

neutral	All in good time my love.
neutral	All in good time.
surprise	Oh shoot!
non-neutral	I left my guitar in their apartment.
neutral	Well you can let me in later.
neutral	I dont have a key, they took mine to give to you.
surprise	What?! They took mine to give to you!
surprise	Why would they take away our keys?
joy	Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
joy	Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
neutral	A
neutral	No. Shes going to live with us for eight weeks.
surprise	Uh, what?
joy	Yes! Shes gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
non-neutral	WhatYoure not serious.
non-neutral	I mean shes a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her.
disgust	Shell drive us totally crazy.
joy	Hi Ross!
joy	Hi roomie!
neutral	Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
neutral	I dont know!
neutral	Its not like its porn!
neutral	This is a serious, legitimate movie.
neutral	Yknow?
neutral	And the nudity is really important to the story.
neutral	Thats what you say about porn.
neutral	Youre right. Maybe I shouldnt even go on the call back.
non-neutral	No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
neutral	Well thats true.
neutral	And I am only naked in one scene.
neutral	Plus it sounds really great.
neutral	My characters catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl.
neutral	Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm.
neutral	So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other.
joy	Its really sweet and-and tender.
neutral	Hey, whats up?
sadness	Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
neutral	But youre still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
joy	"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
neutral	Yeah?
neutral	I just figured yknow, after living with you itd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, yknow?
neutral	Someone I can learn from, someone-someone whos different than me.
neutral	And whats more different than me; a guy whos
neutral	So where are we going next?
neutral	This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
fear	Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
non-neutral	Come on man!  Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
non-neutral	It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
non-neutral	Yeah, no one talks like that!
anger	Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
anger	Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
non-neutral	How do you figure that?
neutral	Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
neutral	I guess so.
neutral	Here you go. Thank you!
neutral	Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
surprise	Oh what, you-you want both of them?
anger	Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
fear	Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it.
neutral	I know it's in the apartment, but I

non-neutral	Tell her to wear her own earrings.
neutral	These
anger	Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
neutral	Why not?
non-neutral	Because I lose her stuff!
neutral	Well, youre-youre sweating.
joy	These-these are beads of joy.
disgust	Oh thats sweet. Dont touch me.
neutral	Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
neutral	Yeah!
neutral	Whats going on?
surprise	Chandlers gone again!
non-neutral	Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
neutral	Okay. You ready to push again?
anger	I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
joy	Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
joy	Yeah!!
joy	Little Leslie is here!
surprise	We got another one!
surprise	Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children.
surprise	How scary is that?
joy	Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
joy	All right, he's coming. He's coming!
surprise	Hey, where's his thing?
surprise	Chandler's a girl!
surprise	Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
surprise	They musta read the sonogram wrong.
surprise	'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl!
surprise	Chandler's a girl!
joy	Okay, keep saying it!

non-neutral	Okay Bob listen uhh, Im the reason you didnt get the job up here.
non-neutral	Toby dont.

anger	Toby! Im not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!
surprise	Ohh!
joy	Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! Its so cute!
joy	I know! I found it on the street.
surprise	Are you seriousReally?! Its in such good condition.
neutral	Yeah.
surprise	Wow! Whoa-whoa whats under the covers?
neutral	I dont know.
non-neutral	Its moving.
disgust	Ew.
fear	Its stillIts got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
fear	Ooh! Ah! Okay!
neutral	Well, I went over to Kyles last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing
non-neutral	we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So
surprise	Oh just say it Kyle!
joy	Were gonna give it another try.
non-neutral	What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
neutral	Im gonna work on that.
non-neutral	Oh right, because youre so capable of change.
non-neutral	Yknow, he hums when he pees!
neutral	I do know.
disgust	It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
sadness	Were so sorry.
non-neutral	Thats all right, we-we dont need you. In fact, hey Im over it already.
anger	Yeah, and yknow what? I dont give a tiny rats ass.
neutral	Yeah, were gonna go.
sadness	Im sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Yknow, she
neutral	Oh. Yknow, he hums while he does other stuff to.
non-neutral	Yeah, we're better off without them.
anger	And yknow, even if they break up again, youd better not let him in your sad mens club!
sadness	Divorced mens club.
neutral	Potato, Potaato.
anger	Why isnt that valet back with my Porsche?
non-neutral	Maybe because youve got the keys?
neutral	Porsche.
anger	This is totally your fault!
anger	My fault?! You threatened the judge!
anger	Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine!!
non-neutral	Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
sadness	Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
neutral	Thank you.
neutral	Yes.
neutral	All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
fear	Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
neutral	Phoebe!
neutral	Yeah?
neutral	Have you seen Chandler?!
neutral	No! Why?
fear	The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard!
fear	I know!
fear	How bad is this?
neutral	!
fear	Well for the regular guy, its bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
fear	I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I cant find him anywhere!
neutral	What are you gonna do?
anger	Well, Im never gonna listen to you again, thats for sure!
neutral	"Yknow, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
surprise	Rachel said that!
anger	Well Rachels not here!
neutral	Come on, come on.
anger	Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.
anger	This is all your fault.
non-neutral	This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know?
anger	My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
non-neutral	The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
non-neutral	No no no, believe me.
anger	No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok?
neutral	And you know what the funny thing is?
non-neutral	When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok?
sadness	Where does that leave me?
neutral	You get to be the baby's father.
neutral	Everyone knows who you are.
non-neutral	Who am I?
sadness	There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
neutral	Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
joy	This is so great.
neutral	You wanna explain that?
sadness	I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one.
joy	And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most.
non-neutral	And it's not even born yet.
joy	It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.
sadness	I'm sorry, you were fighting.
neutral	Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
neutral	Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
joy	I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
neutral	It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can
disgust	Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
disgust	This is disgusting!
disgust	I'm not reading this!
surprise	What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
neutral	All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.
neutral	I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
neutral	You know he's gay?
neutral	I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
neutral	Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
neutral	Hi. Hi.
surprise	What are you doing here?
neutral	Well, what?
neutral	What?
neutral	What is it?
surprise	That she left you?
neutral	That she likes women?
neutral	That she left you for another woman that likes women?
anger	Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
neutral	Then what?
neutral	My first time with Carol was...
neutral	What?
neutral	It was my
surprise	With Carol?  Oh.
surprise	So in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh.
non-neutral	Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
neutral	Hi. Where is everybody?
non-neutral	Oh, its already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
sadness	My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
surprise	Oh no! Why?
sadness	Cause Carols a lesbian.  And, and Im not one. And apparently its not a mix and match situation.
surprise	Oh my God! I dont believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
disgust	Im an idiot.
non-neutral	I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and Id be out and shed, shed see some beautiful woman, and, and shed be Ross y'know look at her, and Id think, God, my wife is cool!
neutral	Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
surprise	Well, now I do!!
sadness	Im sorry.
sadness	Seven years.
sadness	I mean weve been together seven years, shes the only woman whos ever loved me, and the only woman Ive-Ive ever....
sadness	Aw, God Ross. Oh.
neutral	Ill do it.
neutral	No you wont.
sadness	Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, hes sorry.
non-neutral	But,  youve got one more apology to make, all right, youve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
joy	Okay, absolutely!
neutral	All right.
neutral	Youve got it.
anger	Cookie, now you can punch him!
surprise	What?!
anger	All right, that's it, I quit.
surprise	What? I didn't say anything.
non-neutral	Yeah, but this  isn't the face of a person who trusts a person.
non-neutral	Ok, this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
non-neutral	I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
anger	Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
neutral	Julie.
non-neutral	What?!
surprise	Jody!
neutral	You were with Julie?
neutral	Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend.
neutral	And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
surprise	Oh. Oh my God.
non-neutral	Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
anger	Yeah, right.  Sure!
non-neutral	Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time.
sadness	Look, I'm sorry, all right.
sadness	I never meant for you to find out!
anger	Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
anger	That is not true!
anger	Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
non-neutral	Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
sadness	Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to
joy	Hey!
non-neutral	Yeah!
neutral	I cant say.
surprise	Why?!
non-neutral	Why not?
neutral	I cant say because hes famous.
surprise	Oh my God, who is it?!
non-neutral	Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
non-neutral	Okay, okay. Its James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
surprise	As in Barbara Streisands husband James Brolin?
surprise	What?! Well he never said that to me!
neutral	In
sadness	Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
non-neutral	Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
neutral	Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
neutral	I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
non-neutral	Oh, let's not tell this story.
non-neutral	Oh, come on!
non-neutral	Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
surprise	What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
neutral	Hey, it's not like it sounds.
neutral	It's
anger	Wendy, we had a deal!  Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
neutral	Who was that?
non-neutral	Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
non-neutral	Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
neutral	Ten dollars an hour.
neutral	No.
neutral	Twelve dollars an hour.
neutral	Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
non-neutral	You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you.
non-neutral	I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour.
joy	Done.
fear	The reactors gonna blow in three seconds, were never gonna make it!
fear	Youve got to get out of here! Save yourself!
fear	No! I wont leave you!
non-neutral	Dont worry about me, Im a robot! Im just a machine!!
non-neutral	No youre not! Not to me!
non-neutral	Oh my God.
neutral	What?
neutral	I am
joy	Yeah, youre great! Okay, lets take it from
non-neutral	No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
joy	Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
neutral	Oh yeah, youre solid. Yeah, youre just no me.
neutral	Yknow what? I think thats enough for now. Yeah. I dont want to be over rehearsed.
anger	Fine!
anger	Ill do it without you!
anger	I dont need you or anybody else!
anger	Im gonna make it on my own!
anger	Youll see!!
neutral	Youll
sadness	I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
surprise	I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
sadness	We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great    guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
neutral	I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
neutral	And if heaven has a    door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
sadness	I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.    I guess I really missed my chance.
joy	But you didn't!
joy	I'm still alive!!
joy	Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you.
joy	It's a long story but the things    you just said really made my day!
joy	I mean, the fact that you are here means more    to me than if this room were filled with people!
anger	You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on    you!
non-neutral	Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
neutral	Well do a quick check.
neutral	Okay.
surprise	So, eight days late huh?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	You must be a little uncomfortable.
neutral	Eh, just a tad.
neutral	Youre about 80 percent effaced, so youre on your way.
neutral	It still could last a little while longer.
neutral	If youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
non-neutral	Do them!!
neutral	Actually, theyre things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience Ive found that some of them are quite effective.
neutral	Well, we are ready to try anything.
neutral	Okay, theres an herbal tea you can drink.
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	What is wrong with Emma?
neutral	Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
neutral	Anytime you're ready.
neutral	Ok, ok, here we go.
neutral	Ok, where am I talking to, here?
neutral	I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
neutral	Just aim for the bump.
neutral	Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes.
fear	You know, I, you know, can't do this.
disgust	Uh, this is too weird.
sadness	I feel stupid.
neutral	So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
joy	Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
joy	Hello!
neutral	Oh, hi. Its Mark.
neutral	Oh.
fear	What? Is it my breath?
surprise	Ow!
neutral	Rach?
surprise	Ow! Ow!
fear	Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
neutral	Okay, I do.
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	I really do.
neutral	Okay, Im gonna get your coat and then Ill-Ill put you in a cab.
non-neutral	Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, youre not gonna come with me?
surprise	Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Okay?
surprise	Thank you.  Oww!!!! God!
non-neutral	What?! I wh-, whats wrong?
disgust	Im sorry, I just cant go to the hospital lookin like this.
neutral	Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, hes just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
fear	Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
fear	Oh, I cant watch this.
surprise	Check it out, hes winning!  Petes winning!
surprise	Really?!
fear	No-o-o!!
fear	Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
non-neutral	Oh! Oh!
surprise	Wait, if thats his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
surprise	Well, this is ironic.
neutral	Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didnt want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete cant.
anger	Dude, you dont have to brag! We got nothing here!!
neutral	Should we tell Rachel theres an empty private room right next door to hers?
joy	We could, or we can have sex in it.
joy	Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
non-neutral	I thought I was a complete idiot.
neutral	Hey, Im with you. He even asked me if I thought youd go out with him.
disgust	Oh! Oh, I think Im gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
neutral	I said no.
surprise	What?!
surprise	What? II just figured since youre pregnant youre not gonna be seeing people.
anger	Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
non-neutral	I didnt tell him. I didnt know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
non-neutral	Good-good, dont tell him. Dont tell him. Just have him call me okay?
sadness	Rach look, I really dont think thats such a great
joy	Okay, you go do it! Ill come back to that set! Ill meet more actors! Ill meet em all!
neutral	Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshuas gone so you and Emily are free to go.
neutral	Thats okay.
neutral	Shes still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, its too late to do any of the things I had planned, so
anger	Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
neutral	Oh, wait-wait-wait
anger	You tell them to wait!
neutral	Okay. Wait! Wait!
neutral	Emily.
anger	Oh no-no-no! Oh-no!  No! No! Emily!
neutral	Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
anger	Nevermind!
neutral	No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
neutral	I
neutral	Jen.
neutral	Jen, I know this may sound a little But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or
joy	Sure! That would be nice.
neutral	Umm?
non-neutral	Oh! My number is on there.  Give me a call.
neutral	I will give you a call.
neutral	I'll see you later.
joy	Okay!
neutral	I forgot my paper.
neutral	Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
neutral	What?
neutral	Okay.
surprise	Ow!
neutral	Arent you gonna go?
neutral	No. Thank you.
neutral	No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
neutral	Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is no tissue, no tuschy.  Well, if everybodys going.
neutral	No, y'know what dont close it  cause the... keys...are in there.
fear	Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
neutral	Whats going on?
fear	My lighters in there!
neutral	I promise.
neutral	Although, dont feel like you cant visit.
neutral	Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
neutral	No, no hes not.
surprise	You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
surprise	What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
neutral	Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
neutral	Joey, you cant keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
non-neutral	Itll kill him. I mean itll, itll just kill him.
neutral	Well, you could wait til I go to the dentist, maybe
joy	Hi!
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey, what are you doing here?
neutral	Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of
neutral	Ah yeah, but now its Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
neutral	Wheres Ben?
neutral	Hes sleeping.
surprise	Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
non-neutral	Umm, yeah, actually, Susans gonna be home any minute, its kinda an anniversary.
surprise	Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
neutral	Its not that kind of anniversary.
surprise	Ah!  Oh.
neutral	Sooo!! Anyway...
neutral	Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
joy	Oh, oh, oh, Ill get Rainy Day Bear!!
joy	Because hell know what to do?  Oh my God, youre a genius!
non-neutral	Oh God, oh God, its sowed on though.
neutral	Give it. Give it.
neutral	Okay.
surprise	Oh!!
non-neutral	Oh, its just like a bloodbath in here today.
anger	Please. This is so your fault.
surprise	How, how is this my fault?
anger	Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
anger	Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
anger	You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
anger	You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
anger	Oh, I'm threatened by you?
anger	Yes.
anger	Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it!
anger	Get in here.
neutral	Come on.
non-neutral	My god, you guys, I don't believe you.
anger	There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing.
anger	So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
neutral	Yeah, Susan.
anger	Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
neutral	Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
surprise	Oh! Here it is!  Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
surprise	I didnt do that! Who wouldve done that?!
anger	Son of a bitch!
neutral	Okay, maybe ask this guy.
neutral	Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
non-neutral	Yknow sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, arent they?
neutral	Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Yknow? The only problem is, Carls acting is
neutral	The
neutral	Yeah, hes the reason I didnt get that big
neutral	Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
anger	Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
neutral	Hey Monica, theres a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
joy	Sure, I love this part!
neutral	Come on in.
joy	Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
neutral	In the moment, yeah.
non-neutral	But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
neutral	Sure, New Years Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
neutral	No.
neutral	Me neither.
neutral	3, 2,
non-neutral	Joey, you dont have to count down every time we kiss.
non-neutral	Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
surprise	Wow... Wow!
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Alright. Phoebe?
neutral	Okay, okay.
joy	If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
neutral	Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
neutral	Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
disgust	See, there's always one guy.  "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
neutral	Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
neutral	Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
non-neutral	Probably kill myself!
surprise	..Excuse me?
sadness	Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
surprise	Joey, uh-
neutral	You
sadness	Im sorry.
non-neutral	Joey, onstage!
sadness	Well can you at least stay to the end of the play?
sadness	I mean, Ill go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
neutral	Where are you Vic?
sadness	Flights in an hour. I-I gotta go.
non-neutral	Vic! Vic!
anger	In a minute!!
sadness	So this is it? Victor?
sadness	Yeah, I guess it is.
sadness	Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick cause this is killing me.
sadness	One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you.
sadness	But, youve got things you have to do now, and so do I.
sadness	And so Im gonna get on this spaceship,  and Im gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels.
sadness	But when I return, 200 years from now, youll be long gone.
neutral	But I wont have aged at all.
neutral	So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, Im gonna want to meet her.
sadness	So long, Vic!
neutral	I have to say
non-neutral	Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is
neutral	See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on
neutral	What song was that, Pheebs?
joy	Hi Monica!
joy	Hey Mon!
joy	Hey Mon!
surprise	Oh my God, has she slept at all?
neutral	Nope.
neutral	No, it's been three nights in a row.
neutral	Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
neutral	Oh, okay that explains it.
neutral	I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum.
non-neutral	But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
neutral	So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
disgust	Yknow what, I dont know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
neutral	Yeah, I know but
neutral	Oh no-no-no, Im there.
surprise	Hey!
joy	Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
surprise	You made pancakes?
joy	Yep! Grab a plate.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	No-no, stay right there.  Gettin closer.
neutral	Okay, okay, but dont worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles,
neutral	Listen also were uh, were watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
joy	Oh yeah!
neutral	Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
neutral	Yeah, hero sandwiches.
neutral	Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way.
neutral	But y'know what?
neutral	When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all.
neutral	Not you Joey.
surprise	Oh my good God.
neutral	Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
anger	Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
joy	I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
neutral	Oh, the mixed tape.
joy	The Way You Look Tonight
joy	You are just the sweetest.
joy	No! Youre the sweetest!
joy	Hey!
joy	Hey!
neutral	Hey, guess what Im doing tonight.
neutral	What?
neutral	Im checking out the restaurant with Pete.
joy	Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
non-neutral	Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
neutral	So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find
joy	Ooh, actually Ive been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
surprise	Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well, someones been doing their homework.
neutral	Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so
neutral	Oh, I know.  Yknow, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda
neutral	Oh, me too.
joy	and then, we couldve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
neutral	Ross, it just wouldnt have been feasible.
non-neutral	But having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldve been no problem?
joy	It was really fun being married to you tonight.
joy	Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks Ive ever made.
non-neutral	Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	That proposal, at the planetarium
sadness	I know, I know it was stupid.
surprise	Are you kidding?!
joy	With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars!
joy	It wasreally wonderful!
surprise	Did you just make that up?
neutral	No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out.
neutral	Its how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.
neutral	Well, that wouldve been very hard to say no too.
neutral	Its a good thing I didnt do it, because it sounds like it wouldve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night
neutral	Goodnight
neutral	Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldnt get messed up?
neutral	I will think about it.
neutral	Thats all Im askin
surprise	You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldnt feel bad!
non-neutral	Well actually, I-I didnt eat mine. Its still in the bathroom.
neutral	No it isnt, I ate that.
neutral	Well we left ours in Monicas bedroom.
neutral	Nope, got it and I got yours  too.
neutral	Okay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad, and I dont really know what happened with that.
joy	And thats Im so glad theres no problem.
neutral	Thats fine, actually Im on the hiring committee, so therell be at least one friendly face.
joy	Ohh! Thats great!
neutral	You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the
surprise	Really?!
non-neutral	No-ho-ho!
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	I mean, no-no-no-no-no, dont you worry, Im sure with your qualifications you wont need to sleep with some guy to get that job.
neutral	Although, I might need some convincing.
non-neutral	Well, I, umm
joy	Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
surprise	Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
neutral	Yeah but, maybe its not what we think. Maybe its tell Monica Im sorry Idrank the last of the milk.
neutral	Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that hes changed his name, yknow? Tell Monica Im sorry.
surprise	I think it means he freaked out and left!
non-neutral	Dont be so negative! Good God! Isnt it possible that Sorry is sitting in there  right now?!
non-neutral	Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
neutral	LookOkay, Im just gonnaIm gonna have to go find him and bring him back!
neutral	Okay?
neutral	You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Okay
neutral	I will, I will find him.
joy	Hey!
joy	Hi! Hey!
neutral	Do you guys know any cute guys?
joy	Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
non-neutral	Oh, Im sorry. Thank you Chandler.
neutral	Anyway, theres this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go
neutral	Whats the charity?
neutral	I dont know, something either trees or diseaseRalph mumbles a lot.
neutral	Does Ralph mumble when youre not paying attention?
surprise	Yeah! Its weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
neutral	Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
joy	Hey!
neutral	What are you guys doing later?
neutral	Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
surprise	We do?
neutral	I want to see what he wants first.
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	I just found out that Elizabeths dad wants to meet me.
surprise	Wait a minute, hold the phone! Youre not Elizabeths dad?!
fear	Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me.
non-neutral	It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
joy	Of course well help! Yeah! Well be here!
joy	Thanks!
neutral	We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
joy	Oh, hi! How are you doing?
sadness	I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
neutral	Oh.
neutral	Thanks for having me over, you guys.
neutral	Tag?
non-neutral	Y-You're going?
neutral	Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk.
neutral	Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
neutral	Colorado.
neutral	Ah, what good are you.
neutral	Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
neutral	Okay.
sadness	Ah, I-I never should have said what I said.

neutral	Um, I'm not.
sadness	Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out.
sadness	No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.

joy	With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
non-neutral	I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head.
anger	And your like 'Mom, get outta here!'
non-neutral	You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing.

neutral	I just cant decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
non-neutral	Oh what are you kidding? Shes gorgeous, its all Rachel.
neutral	Im sorry, for the last time, why arent you two together again?
neutral	No, I know.
neutral	I know, because youre not in that place.
neutral	Which would be fine, except you totally are.
sadness	Itsits complicated okay?
neutral	Yeah thats true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
sadness	Look, weve been together.
neutral	Okay?
sadness	And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.
sadness	Its just if-if we got together again and it didnt work outI could never do that to Emma.
sadness	I mean she-she thinking everything Oh thatsnow me.
neutral	What do they put something in the water in this place?
non-neutral	Since Rachel and I were doing really, were doing really well right now.
neutral	I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.

non-neutral	We really need to take those tests?
neutral	Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year.
neutral	I think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
non-neutral	But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
neutral	Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
neutral	No. Have you seen David?
neutral	No, no, he hasn't been around.

non-neutral	Im the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
surprise	Uh-oh!
non-neutral	Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
surprise	What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
non-neutral	Im not crazy about babies. Im crazy about us.
surprise	What?
neutral	Look, weve always talked about having babies someday.
neutral	Im not saying it has to be right now, but Im starting to think that we can handle it.
neutral	Were good.
joy	Were really good.
surprise	Oh, did you catch him?!
neutral	Uh-huh.
surprise	Wh-what did he say?!
neutral	He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda."  Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
surprise	Why?! Why not?!
non-neutral	Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here!
neutral	What do you think?
non-neutral	He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
neutral	What did you say to him?
neutral	Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
neutral	Oh yeah, sure.
joy	Okay, in about ten seconds youre gonna see him kiss me.

surprise	Some guy!!
neutral	No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.
surprise	Ken Adams!!
neutral	How we doing, you guys ready?
neutral	Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
neutral	Some days it's all I can think about.
neutral	Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
neutral	Oh... ok, fine.
neutral	But... ehm...
neutral	I just have one question for you,    ehm...
neutral	When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance,    or stroll...
non-neutral	Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok,    let's go!!
surprise	I cant believe this! How long as this been going on?
neutral	Well umm, Alexandra has been

non-neutral	Phoebe, dont get upset!
anger	OkayOop! Too late! Im leaving! Come on Chandler lets go!
neutral	Well, Phoebe I thought IdYeah, what the hell.
non-neutral	Ben!
non-neutral	Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
fear	Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
neutral	Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts?
neutral	No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here  is the puncture wound from your ring.
sadness	Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
sadness	Sorry.
non-neutral	Sorry!
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	I got my s's back!
neutral	Which we can celebrate later.
neutral	Celebrate.
non-neutral	Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
non-neutral	Rachel, how did this happen?
non-neutral	I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
neutral	Where?
neutral	At his apartment. Is this juice?
non-neutral	Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
non-neutral	Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
surprise	I licked my arm, what?
neutral	It's breast milk.
neutral	So?
neutral	Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
non-neutral	What is the big deal?
surprise	What did you just do?
disgust	Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
neutral	You won't even taste it?
disgust	No!
neutral	Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
disgust	Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
surprise	Aww!
joy	Thats funny.
disgust	Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my newold sheet?
non-neutral	Oh sure!  Noo!
surprise	Ohh!!
surprise	My apothecary table!!!
surprise	What?!
non-neutral	Noooooo!!
surprise	Ross, where did you get this?!
neutral	I got it at
non-neutral	Oh my God, Phoebe,
non-neutral	Wow! Oh my God, well if theyve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
neutral	Oh yes.
disgust	Well this doesnt even smell like opium.
anger	Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
non-neutral	Oh Ross, calm down, Ill give you the 80 cents.
non-neutral	How is she?
neutral	It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
neutral	How's the hair?
sadness	I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good.
neutral	I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
neutral	Can we see her?
sadness	Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
non-neutral	Yeah.
non-neutral	How're you doing?
neutral	Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
non-neutral	Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
disgust	That would be no.
neutral	Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
non-neutral	Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
non-neutral	Cantaloupe juice.
non-neutral	Exactly.
surprise	You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
neutral	Uh huh.
non-neutral	Oh, you've tasted it.
neutral	You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
non-neutral	Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel.
non-neutral	I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
neutral	Yknow, if they knew what they were doing they probably didnt give you real names either.
non-neutral	Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they dont give out fake names.
neutral	Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
neutral	Regina Philange.
surprise	I still dont get it, we didnt do anything wrong.
non-neutral	I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
surprise	I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
non-neutral	Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
non-neutral	Well maybe it was all of your questions.
non-neutral	What about my questions?
neutral	No, Im sorry. Its just my foot itches like crazy.
neutral	Oh, Ill get it.
surprise	Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.
non-neutral	Relax, its not like were forking.
joy	Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpapers a little faded, thats okay. Carpets a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
non-neutral	Hey!
neutral	Hello.
joy	Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! Its so beautiful.
joy	I know!!!
joy	So, Im here, ready to play.
neutral	Okay.
joy	I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.
surprise	Whats this?
joy	Thats a dog, every house should have a dog.
surprise	Not one that can pee on the roof.
non-neutral	Well, maybe its so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
surprise	And is this in case the house sneezes?
neutral	No, no, thats the ghost for the attic.
fear	I dont want a ghost.
neutral	Well, nobody wants a ghost. But youve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
surprise	Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
neutral	Okay, obviously you dont know much about the U.S. government.
surprise	Hey!
neutral	Hello.
non-neutral	I need to talk to you!
neutral	Sure, whats up?
non-neutral	All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
disgust	Please, I'm not going for anything.
non-neutral	Well, if you don't, I will.
non-neutral	Would you please go?
non-neutral	I would!
joy	Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
neutral	Uh-huh.
non-neutral	Watch, watch.
surprise	Ooohhhh!!
non-neutral	And, and!
surprise	Ahhhh!!
surprise	Hey, my Fathers house does that!
neutral	O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
neutral	Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
neutral	Hmm.
disgust	Of course, I didnt get to enjoy any of that, because Joannas such a
neutral	Okay. Its Emma.
non-neutral	Emma!  See? I dont want it.
neutral	Take it.
neutral	What?
neutral	Its clearly an Emma.
non-neutral	Oh honey, but you love that name.
joy	Yeah, but I love you more.
neutral	Besides yknow, nothing goes with Bing.
non-neutral	So Im screwed.
neutral	I mean  Oh, hi Emma.
neutral	Yeah, thats you.
joy	Youre our little Em.
surprise	Oh whats that honey?
surprise	What?
surprise	Oh, you want a little cousin?
non-neutral	You want a cousin right now?
non-neutral	!
joy	Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" Im happy all the time!
non-neutral	Nice try.
non-neutral	Wait, wait, wait!
neutral	Look, Monica
surprise	Look!
non-neutral	This is not going to work.
joy	I bet this will work!
joy	You are so great! I love you!
surprise	What?
non-neutral	Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
surprise	You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
non-neutral	No I didn't!
non-neutral	Yes, you did!
non-neutral	No I didn't!
joy	You love me!
anger	No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
neutral	Hello Greg?
neutral	Hi, this is Monica from the plane?
anger	Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5   That is their old number!
anger	Jennys been giving it out since they moved!
non-neutral	Jenny! That is so Jenny!
neutral	Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together?
neutral	Say next Saturday?
neutral	Okay, how about Sunday?
non-neutral	Okay umm, the week after that?
non-neutral	The week after that?
anger	Yknow what Greg?
anger	Yknow what?
non-neutral	We are good, interesting, funny people with
neutral	Hey Chandler! Yknow that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
neutral	Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
neutral	Whats a Movement class?
neutral	Its Chandlers way of pretending he didnt take mime.
joy	Oh well listen, anyway shes directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
neutral	Oh, I dont know man. I havent talked to her in like ten years.
neutral	I am.
neutral	Joey, what are you talking about? Youre a terrific actor.
surprise	You really think so?
surprise	Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
surprise	Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the
non-neutral	Oh, okay, I'm having another one!
surprise	This one doesn't hurt eitherOoh, yes it does!
non-neutral	Ow!
non-neutral	Ow!
non-neutral	Ow!
non-neutral	Ow!
surprise	Ooh!
non-neutral	Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
neutral	Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
non-neutral	All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good.  Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
joy	Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye!  Hi!
joy	Hi!
fear	That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
neutral	Oh, honey, dont worry. She's gonna make it on time.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
non-neutral	But sadly I could not be enticed.
disgust	Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
non-neutral	I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
non-neutral	Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not.
neutral	Eh?
neutral	All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket.
neutral	I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
non-neutral	I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
neutral	Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Well, what period is it from?
neutral	Uh, its from yore. Like the days of yore. Yknow?
neutral	Yes, yes I do.
joy	God, oh its just perfect!
joy	Wow!
joy	I bet it has a great story behind it too.
neutral	Did they tell you anything?
neutral	Like yknow where it was from or
joy	Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
joy	White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
non-neutral	So, you still dont think Im boyfriend material?
neutral	Huh?
neutral	I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
anger	I, umm, shut up!
non-neutral	Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. Ill miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk. You just wrote this!
neutral	Well, its pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
non-neutral	Noooo!!
neutral	All right, hang on!
neutral	Rachel, its going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
non-neutral	But I
neutral	No-no, wait!
non-neutral	Just let me finish, okay?
neutral	This isnt something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want.
neutral	And it
surprise	It is? Really?
neutral	Yeah, sweetie.
sadness	I mean were not, were not gonna live together anymore?
sadness	No.
sadness	What? Oh my God! Im gonna miss you so much!
sadness	Im gonna miss you!
sadness	I mean its the end of an era!
sadness	I know!
surprise	Why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
non-neutral	Oh. Thats so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, Wheres number 27?!
neutral	Y'know what?
neutral	It didnt.
joy	Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what Ive got with Alice.
surprise	Now, wh-what, what is that like?
joy	Its so cool man, its so, its just cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
neutral	Yeah, yeah.
non-neutral	Why cant I find that?
anger	Dont ask me, I had it and I blew it!
non-neutral	Well, I want it!
non-neutral	You can have it!
non-neutral	I dont know, maybe I cant. I mean, maybe theres something wrong with me.
non-neutral	Oh, no! No!
joy	Its out there man! Ive seen it! I got it!!
non-neutral	Then you hold on to it!!
joy	All right, man!!
joy	All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
neutral	Come on, Lydia, you can do it.
joy	Push!
joy	Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder.
joy	Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out!
joy	Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho.
joy	Let's  I was justyeah, right.
joy	Push!
joy	Push!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
non-neutral	Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
surprise	Okay, go left. Left! Left!
anger	Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
non-neutral	Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!
non-neutral	Straight up over your head!
joy	You can do it!
joy	You can do it!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	You got it?

surprise	Ohh!
neutral	What?
surprise	It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
surprise	Oh my God!
neutral	Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
fear	Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
disgust	Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!
non-neutral	Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I dont have time!
neutral	Theyre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
non-neutral	Youre coming on to the entire room!  Im Chandler.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	You mind if I
neutral	No, please.
neutral	So uh, what are you in for?
neutral	I talk in my sleep.
neutral	What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
neutral	So why dont you give me your number?
neutral	Previously on Friends.
neutral	I dont know exactly. Its-its sorta like wrestling.
surprise	Oh?!
neutral	Yeah, but without the costumes.
neutral	Oh.
neutral	And its not fake, its totally brutal.
neutral	Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Theyre
surprise	So you can like, bite, and pull peoples hair and stuff?
neutral	Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
surprise	Whats fish hooking?
neutral	Huh, whats fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
non-neutral	What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
non-neutral	Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
joy	Well, that makes me feel so good.
neutral	It was just so awkward and bumpy.
surprise	Bumpy?
neutral	Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.
neutral	And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
non-neutral	Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
non-neutral	Coming through!  Oh! Coming through!  Oh! Hello! Hi!  No! Right! Coming through!
neutral	Oh well, its not so bad.
sadness	Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
surprise	Oh!
surprise	My God!
neutral	Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
surprise	Excuse me?
non-neutral	Joey! Hes working!  You would look
non-neutral	Oh, how bad is it?
sadness	Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that isnt burned is an ass. Which I do
neutral	Hows your room Rach?
sadness	Everythings ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
neutral	Isnt that mine?
non-neutral	Fine! Im sorry for your loss!
neutral	So uh, youre not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
non-neutral	Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am
neutral	Yes, they can stay with us.
neutral	Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
non-neutral	Theres just so much pressure.
neutral	I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.
neutral	I dont know if youd understand.
neutral	Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
non-neutral	Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!
neutral	Well, yknow.
fear	I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time.
neutral	So Im gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on.
neutral	Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	Whats all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
neutral	Ross, we can handle this.
sadness	Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.
anger	I mean, enough of the silliness!
anger	Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!
non-neutral	Okay-okay!
non-neutral	Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together.
non-neutral	Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?
non-neutral	That is so silly.
neutral	Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
neutral	Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
joy	Love is the best medicine.
non-neutral	Thats laughter.
neutral	Why do you do it?
neutral	I dont know.
neutral	Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
neutral	Yeah, I do.
neutral	And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, dont ya?
neutral	Yes.
joy	Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
neutral	Oh.
neutral	But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
neutral	Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
surprise	You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
neutral	Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.
non-neutral	Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!
non-neutral	Define me!
non-neutral	Love me, I need love!
neutral	'.
surprise	Have you really done this before?
joy	Yeah!
joy	Yeah!
joy	Yeah!
neutral	You just take a big, big swing.
neutral	Now, dont hold back.
neutral	and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
joy	Hey!
joy	Hey-hey-hey!
neutral	What are you doing?
joy	Were just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
neutral	Oh, all right.
joy	Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
non-neutral	Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
joy	Okay!
neutral	All right.
neutral	Bye!
neutral	Bye!
non-neutral	Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
neutral	Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey.
neutral	Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
neutral	Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
surprise	Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one!
neutral	Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials?
non-neutral	Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down?
neutral	Because we can remember them.
non-neutral	Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
neutral	Hey. When you guys were kids and you played
neutral	I was always Joanne.
neutral	Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! the war cry of your neighbourhood?
disgust	Ewww! Oh! Its the Mattress King!
non-neutral	Booo!!
disgust	Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
joy	Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
anger	What a wank!
anger	Oh, I cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses.
non-neutral	I know!
non-neutral	And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.
non-neutral	And Im appalled for you by the way.
non-neutral	You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it alone.
disgust	Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my food.
anger	Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
disgust	Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
neutral	Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
fear	Im, Im freaking out!
fear	Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have!
neutral	All right, I havent lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.
neutral	Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
neutral	Um. yeah.
neutral	I am
neutral	All right, look, heres the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.
neutral	So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
non-neutral	Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work.
neutral	Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but thats why you have got to be the bigger man here.
non-neutral	Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me!
non-neutral	Like me tiny doctor!
non-neutral	Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
non-neutral	Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along.
anger	Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.
non-neutral	Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna have to have a separate room for you too!
anger	!
neutral	Okay, okay, okay.  Ill get the bagels.
neutral	Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
neutral	All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
neutral	Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
surprise	Really? A purse?
non-neutral	It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
neutral	It looks like a women's purse.
neutral	No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,
neutral	See look,
neutral	Exactly! Unisex!
neutral	Maybe you need sex.
non-neutral	No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
neutral	Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
neutral	So, um, have you told your parents?
neutral	No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
neutral	Here you go.
neutral	You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.
neutral	.
neutral	.
non-neutral	no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.
joy	I love you Phoebe.
surprise	So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
joy	Hey!

sadness	Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
non-neutral	Why, exactly?
sadness	Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
surprise	Chandler that's crazy!
anger	If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!

neutral	Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
neutral	Right.
non-neutral	Now that youre on youre own, youre free to look as stupid as you like.
neutral	You like it right?
neutral	Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! Im kidding!

non-neutral	And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
anger	All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.

neutral	You cant ask us son, thats cheating.
neutral	Youre right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
neutral	Well, he better not come by here. He cant see the bride in the wedding dress.
non-neutral	As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
neutral	But that was after the wedding, its not bad luck then.
neutral	Honey, it isnt good luck.
surprise	Oh my God! Monica!

neutral	Great. Hes doing great. Dont you worry about Chandler.
neutral	Are you okay?

surprise	Oh, youre switching apartments?
neutral	Its not for me, its for Rachel.
neutral	But Rachel has an apartment.
neutral	Yeah, but when the baby comes shes gonna want to move.
surprise	She is?
surprise	Yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you?
neutral	I guess I didnt really think about it.
non-neutral	Ezel!  Hey Gunther! Youre an ezel!
anger	Damnit!
surprise	Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people?
neutral	Little village people.
joy	Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
joy	Oh, that is so sweet!
joy	I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
neutral	Huh. Except, Phoebes not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
sadness	Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies.
sadness	Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
surprise	Wait a minute!
joy	Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after shes done being pregnant.
neutral	Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
joy	Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants shes always wanted!
joy	Oh, shes gonna love that!
neutral	Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
neutral	Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
neutral	So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
anger	Fine, Im mentally unstable.
neutral	And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Uh yes, heroin and crack.
anger	Crack isnt even an intravenous drug!
neutral	Well, you would know.
neutral	Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
non-neutral	Oh, come on!
non-neutral	Ross, please, I found the magazines!
non-neutral	No!
neutral	Phoebe just because I'm alone doesnt mean I wanna walk around naked.
neutral	I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
non-neutral	Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
sadness	I know, I lied! I didnt want her to think I was a terrible mother! I cant even see my own baby!
neutral	Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  its-its-its, its right there .
joy	Oh. Oh, its beautiful. I see it now.

non-neutral	Will you stop!
neutral	Okay. All right.
joy	Okay, all right, I think youre great, I think youre sweet, and youre smart, and I love you.
disgust	But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
joy	Hey!

non-neutral	Oh yeah! Yeah! Dont worry about me, Ill be fine!
neutral	You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
neutral	Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
non-neutral	Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
non-neutral	Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby?
neutral	Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
non-neutral	oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks.

neutral	Who's he sleeping with?
neutral	Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...

anger	You know, this isn't fair.
anger	What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?
non-neutral	Huh?
anger	Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?
non-neutral	Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?

anger	Go!!
neutral	All right, all right, all right.
neutral	I mean Ill have to check with him first, but Ill think hell be cool with it.
non-neutral	So, hes just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesnt want anything in exchange for helping him?
neutral	Well, I assume Ill have to take showers with him, but y'know, thats true of any job.
neutral	How ya feelin?
neutral	Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it.

neutral	Its got all of these layers.
neutral	First theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.
non-neutral	[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like somethings wrong.]
neutral	then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!

non-neutral	She is not  Shes gay. Oh my God. She is
surprise	Good day for married people huh?
sadness	Im sorry your husband cheated on you.
non-neutral	Im sorry your wife is gay. I guess women arent that great either.

joy	You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
non-neutral	Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
anger	By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
neutral	That's OK.
surprise	Oh, are you sure?
surprise	Really?
anger	Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
neutral	We can't do that.
surprise	What? What can't you do?
surprise	She really said that?
neutral	Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...
neutral	But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
surprise	'Tonight' tonight?
joy	Well, I think it's perfect.
neutral	Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
non-neutral	I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
joy	Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
disgust	Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
neutral	Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
neutral	No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.

sadness	O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
anger	Really stupid.
non-neutral	Really stupid.
non-neutral	And I don't even know how it happened.
sadness	I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.
fear	Are we okay now?
anger	Yeah. No. No...
neutral	Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
neutral	Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
surprise	You're kidding.
neutral	No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
neutral	Oh there it is.
neutral	Thats not your regular dry cleaners.
disgust	I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one.
disgust	I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store
surprise	What?!
neutral	A new grocery store.
non-neutral	The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and thats what they gave me?
anger	When I get up there Im going to kick some ass.
neutral	Dont worry Phoebe, youre gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
neutral	Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
neutral	Oh, you didnt have to come in with me.
non-neutral	Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like

surprise	Im sorry, its just that youre so incredibly beautiful.
neutral	Oh yeah well, Im sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?
non-neutral	I hope you dont think Im crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
neutral	A little.   Now youre talking.
neutral	Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
joy	I-I-Id love to. Let me just tell my friend.
joy	Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
neutral	She mustve left.
anger	Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
surprise	Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
joy	That's right baby.
neutral	All right, let me in.
non-neutral	No-no! Don't do it! Don't!

non-neutral	It's throwing and catching!
neutral	All right.
surprise	Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
non-neutral	Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
surprise	Oh myOh good God!
non-neutral	I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
neutral	Baking it didn't help, huh?
neutral	All right, well the place was closed. Ill just copy it later.
non-neutral	Or not. Uh, Rach, why dont you just move in with me?
surprise	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
neutral	No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no Its okay, I mean Ilook Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursdays thing, but we dont have to do that!
neutral	Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless youre thinking about Naked Wednesdays.
joy	Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
joy	So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
neutral	Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
non-neutral	Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
disgust	Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
neutral	I was shrieking... like a Marine.
neutral	All right here. Watch me execute the three Ps of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.
neutral	She's not much of a phone person.
neutral	Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
non-neutral	Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
neutral	Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
non-neutral	Maybe you should.
non-neutral	Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
neutral	You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
neutral	Oh, that is so not true.
neutral	Oh, it is.
neutral	It isn't.
neutral	It is.
anger	Isn't!
neutral	Okay ladies, that ends todays class, and lets remember, lets be safe out there.
joy	Its a great class.
neutral	Thanks.
neutral	Yeah, yeah, I was watching.
neutral	Umm, hey, a couple of questions though.
non-neutral	Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
neutral	Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them
non-neutral	No. No-no. No. What would
surprise	Who? Me the attacker?
sadness	Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you.

non-neutral	Of course!
sadness	Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh
sadness	Ohh, Im sorry.

non-neutral	What?! Anything! Anything!
neutral	Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.
non-neutral	This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
surprise	Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
neutral	Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later.
neutral	Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over here. All right, come on
non-neutral	Hey, you guys. Listen, Im sorry that I was hogging the game beforeOh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
neutral	Theyre all Chandler.
surprise	Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good!
neutral	I did.  But it came at a price.
fear	But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.
surprise	Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!
joy	Sure!
neutral	Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?
joy	With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!
joy	And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!
neutral	Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much.
joy	Well, I like that idea.
joy	Obviously!
neutral	I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow?
neutral	I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like
disgust	No.
non-neutral	Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely."
disgust	Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
surprise	So, thats it?
neutral	I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
neutral	Which is why
anger	What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
non-neutral	I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
non-neutral	Are you mocking me?
neutral	No, Im not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.
joy	Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
joy	Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
neutral	Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but
neutral	Cat.
joy	Yes! You are so smart!  I love you.
joy	I love you too.
non-neutral	I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!

neutral	Okay. Okay, but you cant fire him today.
non-neutral	Why not?!
non-neutral	Because Im dumping him today.
surprise	What?! You said he was sweet!
neutral	He
neutral	Just dont pick up your phone.
disgust	Then he comes over!  "Im so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
surprise	What? So now Im not allowed to fire him?
non-neutral	You cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill himself.
neutral	Okay well then, Ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
disgust	Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill
neutral	Okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it!
non-neutral	Okay. But the question is whos gonna go first. Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
non-neutral	Really? Thats the thing Im worse at! Youll see.
neutral	This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
sadness	Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
sadness	Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone?

joy	I know. I like it up here.
non-neutral	I feel like were the only two people in the world.  Oops. Sorry.
non-neutral	Whats the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?

neutral	All right, so we werent
neutral	Im sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but Ilook, I just want you guys to be safe.
neutral	What are you doing?
neutral	Im leaning. This is where I lean.
neutral	Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
fear	Brenda a bee!
surprise	What?
non-neutral	Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
disgust	I think I know whats going on here.
neutral	You do?
disgust	Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its wrong. Youre married.
neutral	I totally understand.  Can I
joy	All right, let's do it!
surprise	No, no, no. What was that?
neutral	I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
non-neutral	Well, people!
neutral	People, people, people.
neutral	Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey.
neutral	Show 'em how it's done.
neutral	Count it off.
neutral	So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
disgust	Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and hes so cheap, hed never fly to London in a million years.
neutral	Yeah, invite him?
neutral	Hey, did I do these neat enough?
neutral	Yeah, theyre fine.
non-neutral	Yeah?
surprise	If anyone asks, well just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
neutral	Sure. Why not?
surprise	Really?
neutral	Yeah?
non-neutral	I dont think Id be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
fear	Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldnt invite her?
non-neutral	Oh, no-no, yknow I absolutely adore Rachel its just that, well it might be a awkward for you.
neutral	But its absolutely your decision.
neutral	More tea?
neutral	Yeah sure.
neutral	Earl Grey?
non-neutral	Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.

non-neutral	Oh no, I know I couldnt see it either at first, but its right umm  Ross, I lost it again.
non-neutral	Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
neutral	Excuse me?
neutral	Could you help me with something?
neutral	The patient Im looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.
neutral	And umm, hes like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
neutral	I think I know who youre talking about.
joy	Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
neutral	Im sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff
neutral	Uh, shes with me.  Dr. Drake Remoray.
neutral	Dr. Drake who?
neutral	Remoray. Its Portuguese. We need that information; Im a doctor.
surprise	A doctor at this hospital?
anger	Damnit woman were losing precious time! Now do you want this mans blood on your head?
neutral	Hands.
neutral	Hands!
neutral	It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in.

joy	816, thank you!
neutral	Thank you.

neutral	Yeah.
surprise	Oh my God.
neutral	I know.
neutral	Okay, I gotta go.
surprise	Whoa! What?! Why?!
sadness	Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
surprise	Here?! Now?!
neutral	Well, yeah.
fear	I cant-I cant stay here all night, and if I go in there shes-shes gonna wanna... do stuff.
surprise	What happened?
sadness	Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago.
joy	Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
anger	Stupid, useless Canadian money!
neutral	Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
surprise	Really?
neutral	Will you call him?
joy	Yes!
joy	I will!
joy	Absolutely!
neutral	(She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other.
neutral	She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in
joy	Oh my God! That is so good!
neutral	Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it.
neutral	Hey!
neutral	Hey!
neutral	What do you got there?

surprise	Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
surprise	What?! Tonight?!
neutral	Thats what Monica said.
surprise	After she gave me that big speech?!
anger	She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?
anger	I think shes trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
neutral	Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
disgust	Who cares? I repel women.
surprise	No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Its yours!
non-neutral	Yeah well, Im-Im a slut.

joy	Hi Jill!
joy	Hey!
neutral	Hi .
neutral	Rachel.
surprise	Rachel! Well, you-youre not at home, youre-youre-youre right here.
non-neutral	Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But its not!
neutral	Okay. So well Ill umm,  Ill have her home by midnight.
non-neutral	That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
sadness	I'm sorry, man.
neutral	Hey, y'know what you should do?
neutral	You should make something happen for yourself.
neutral	Y'know, like-like write a play.
joy	Write a movie!
neutral	Huh?
neutral	I mean, what about those
sadness	Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
joy	Wait a second, I could star in it!
neutral	Or that.
non-neutral	I can't write!
sadness	Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?
sadness	I can't do it.
neutral	I'll help you.
neutral	Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.
neutral	And plus, it'll give me something to do.
neutral	Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
neutral	Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope thats cool.
neutral	Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
neutral	Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.
neutral	Although, I should probably tell you, shes a porn star.
neutral	Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good.
neutral	All right.
non-neutral	As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
neutral	Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt have to apologize.
neutral	I would really love it if I could do both.
non-neutral	All right, II have to ask.
neutral	What?
fear	Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
surprise	What?!
anger	Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
disgust	A hundred and forty-five pounds.
non-neutral	Yes, yes it is. Its uh  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
non-neutral	Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me?
anger	Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didnt bring you here so you can ambush her.
neutral	Frannie was the one who found your
anger	That bitch!
surprise	Monica! What
anger	Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
neutral	Hi Frannie, congratulations.
anger	You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!
surprise	Why?!
non-neutral	WhatWhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding?
non-neutral	What could I have possibly done?!
anger	Stuart!
neutral	I believe you know my husband.
neutral	So its really a question of
non-neutral	Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
surprise	Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
neutral	Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
surprise	Yeah?
neutral	It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
neutral	What's up?
neutral	Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk.
neutral	Man to uh, me.
neutral	Sure. Okay.
surprise	Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
neutral	Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
neutral	You mean scared.
neutral	No, I mean happy.
joy	Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
sadness	Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in.
surprise	What do you mean, theyre not moving in? They-theyre still moving in right?
neutral	No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
surprise	What?! Over a stupid room!
joy	Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but Im also really psyched cause I dont have to move in here!
joy	Oh no, yeah no, that parts great!
neutral	Yes
surprise	Shut-out!!
surprise	Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
non-neutral	Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
anger	Yeah, get out!
anger	You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!
anger	Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?
anger	Come on, wussies!
neutral	All right, ok, I gotta go.
neutral	I'm going,  and I'm gone.
neutral	One more game?
joy	Oh yeah!
sadness	Im sorry.
sadness	Ohhh. Dont go.
non-neutral	No, I-I-I gotta go.
non-neutral	No. No! No! No!
non-neutral	Honey, honey, people are looking.
anger	I dont care!  I dont care!!
non-neutral	Yeah, um, Im, Im leaving now.
non-neutral	You cant leave! I have your shoe!
non-neutral	Good-bye Chandler Bing.
neutral	Rachel has those in burgendy.
disgust	Oh, ew!
neutral	What?
neutral	Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you.
neutral	Um, can you roll your tongue?
neutral	Because I can, and my Mom couldnt, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
neutral	What, wait, you mean like this?
surprise	Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
neutral	Your not doing it.
neutral	Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I cant. We dont have that....
neutral	Where there is no fear of commitment.
neutral	Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
neutral	Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.
neutral	But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.
fear	It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!
neutral	If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.
neutral	Right.
neutral	In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
non-neutral	Amazingly, that makes sense.
neutral	You think?
joy	Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
fear	Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
joy	Hey!  Hey!
joy	Hi!
joy	Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
joy	Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
neutral	Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
neutral	Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
surprise	Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!
non-neutral	Im missin picture time?!
anger	Yknow she has a face Ross!
non-neutral	Okay. Okay, heres a good one of us.
joy	Wow!
joy	That is a good one!
joy	Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card yknow, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
neutral	Yknow, every year I say Im gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it.
neutral	Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?
surprise	Together? Like-like to people?
joy	Yeah, yknow. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. Itll be cute, okay?
non-neutral	Okay.
neutral	Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?
neutral	Uh sure, sure.
neutral	Bye guys.
non-neutral	I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
non-neutral	You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve got a girlfriend?
neutral	Is this about Mark?
surprise	Oh my God.
neutral	Okay, its not, its not.
non-neutral	Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
neutral	Fine, youre right.
neutral	Lets ah, lets take a break,  lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
non-neutral	No. A break from us.
non-neutral	Bing! Were all set for tonight, 8 oclock.
non-neutral	Oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. Monica has to work.
non-neutral	Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
neutral	Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.
non-neutral	Oh? Why not?
neutral	Its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament.
non-neutral	Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
non-neutral	Well now-now youre just talking crazy.
neutral	So why cant the three of us go out together?
sadness	Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
non-neutral	Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.
joy	And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
anger	Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
neutral	Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this.
joy	Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club.
anger	Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.
neutral	Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.
neutral	It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.
anger	: Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!
neutral	It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
neutral	What are you doing?
neutral	Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy.
neutral	Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.
neutral	There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.
neutral	Did he call?
sadness	No. Sorry.
non-neutral	Why?! Why?! He said hed call. Why hasnt he called?
neutral	Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
non-neutral	Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasnt he called, Rachel? Why?
neutral	Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
surprise	Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
neutral	Well...
non-neutral	The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you?
neutral	No. I...
anger	Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
non-neutral	And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?
non-neutral	I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion!
anger	Is that too much to ask after six years?!
non-neutral	I mean what?
non-neutral	Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!
non-neutral	I mean do we not have as much fun?!
non-neutral	Dont I deserve a few tears?!!
non-neutral	I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
non-neutral	Hey!
anger	I did not cry my eyes out!!
non-neutral	Come on!
sadness	Its like the end of an era!
sadness	No more J-man and Channies!
non-neutral	!
non-neutral	Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
neutral	Do I know why were rushing?
neutral	Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
neutral	Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.
joy	Oh, I found it!
surprise	!
joy	Thats so great for you guys!
joy	Yeah!
neutral	Good luck, with your girlfriend.
joy	Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!
neutral	Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
neutral	Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
neutral	So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
joy	Yes, you can, very much.
surprise	Ahhhh!!
non-neutral	Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
neutral	Do
neutral	Ah,
neutral	Do
neutral	Ah,
non-neutral	DO YOU?
non-neutral	Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was a beautiful speech.
disgust	Oh, come on.
non-neutral	Hey!
joy	All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!
neutral	And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.
neutral	And what you said about Nana.
non-neutral	Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there.
neutral	And you know what?
neutral	I think she was.
surprise	Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
neutral	You forget how many great songs Heart had.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
non-neutral	So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
neutral	Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but Im not even sure I got it.
neutral	What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey.
neutral	And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.
non-neutral	You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
neutral	Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
anger	I cant find garbage bags!
neutral	Oh, I think I saw some in here.
surprise	What is it?!
disgust	I dont know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itll die.
non-neutral	I cant believe were living here!
surprise	You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really  proposing?
non-neutral	No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.
surprise	Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it  look like?!
non-neutral	I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of  it.
non-neutral	Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
sadness	Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don't want to hurt her.
neutral	Okay, look, just do it gently.
neutral	You're right.
neutral	You're right.
neutral	I-I'll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I'll be gentle.

neutral	Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
neutral	Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
joy	Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which
joy	Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here
anger	You completely stole my answer!
non-neutral	Well, honey that was pretty obvious.

fear	When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
neutral	Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
neutral	See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.

anger	Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!

disgust	Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
neutral	Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight.
non-neutral	I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
sadness	Im sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby
neutral	So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?

joy	Oh, what a fun office.
neutral	I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.
neutral	So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
neutral	Rachel? Do you smoke?
neutral	Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror storiesabout ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
neutral	What?
neutral	Peach pit.
neutral	Yes, Bunny?
neutral	Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
neutral	-Peaches?

sadness	So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
neutral	It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
neutral	Do you want me to be afraid of you?
neutral	Of course not.
joy	I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.
non-neutral	I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
surprise	Really?
neutral	Of course!
non-neutral	Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
neutral	All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit
anger	Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is
disgust	A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
non-neutral	Ooh, it's not a toy.
sadness	Well, I don't know what else to do.
non-neutral	I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!
non-neutral	So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!
non-neutral	'Cause I-I got nothing!
non-neutral	All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.
neutral	Okay then.

anger	What the hell!
anger	This is broken!
anger	It-it is broken!

neutral	Excuse me.
neutral	Yeah?
neutral	Are you Phoebe Buffay?
neutral	Yeah.
joy	Can-can I get your autograph, Im your biggest fan.
neutral	I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
joy	Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
non-neutral	No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
neutral	Come on, two on one.
surprise	What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
surprise	What, now?
joy	Yes, now is when you swoop!
joy	You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not!
non-neutral	You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
neutral	My Catholic friend is right.
neutral	She's distraught.
neutral	You're there for her.
joy	You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
neutral	Well, I just called Joshua
non-neutral	Oh, how did it go?
neutral	Well, I did my best to convince him that Im not some crazy girl who is dying to get marriedIm just going through a hard time.
neutral	What did he say?
non-neutral	Well uh, his answering machine was
non-neutral	Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that hes gonna call you again.
sadness	Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care.
sadness	I dont think hes the one Im sad about.
sadness	Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well.
sadness	Yeah, maybe.
sadness	And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
non-neutral	Any luck?
sadness	Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?
sadness	I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
non-neutral	Again. Yknow what? I think we all did.
non-neutral	Hey!
surprise	I dont get it!
non-neutral	It was in my room all night!
non-neutral	And if she didnt take it, and I didnt take it; and you  didnt take it, then who did?
anger	Shh!
anger	Were trying to think!
neutral	This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
surprise	What?!
joy	Oh yeah!
neutral	I got in there myself once.
neutral	My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldnt, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.
neutral	Yeah.
non-neutral	It was funny til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
neutral	No, you, you cant fit in that thing. Thats not deep enough.
non-neutral	Oh yeah?  If I cant, Ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
neutral	All right, you have yourself a deal.
surprise	Okay.  See?! I told ya!
non-neutral	Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
neutral	Hey! Whats up?
non-neutral	Hey!
joy	Hey-hey, whos your friend?  Hey!!

joy	Why wouldnt ya? Erin is great! Then-then theres you guys.
joy	Ohh, listen. Ive got to get going. Today was great, thanks!

non-neutral	Look at this, look.
non-neutral	She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.
non-neutral	She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.
non-neutral	She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
neutral	You're not an artist.
non-neutral	Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
surprise	I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
non-neutral	No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
neutral	I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
non-neutral	Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!

disgust	Oh, that is so sick.
disgust	I feel violated. And not in a good way.
surprise	How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
joy	Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
non-neutral	Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.

surprise	What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
sadness	Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
neutral	Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
sadness	Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right?
neutral	Yeah, I guess so.
sadness	I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
surprise	Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?!
joy	I just found out this is Chandlers office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!
non-neutral	Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
anger	We said seven!
anger	We said six!
neutral	The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.
anger	Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!"
joy	Hi!
disgust	Oh my good God.
disgust	Ugh!
non-neutral	I know what time you said.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.

non-neutral	Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.
neutral	Well, were really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
non-neutral	On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane.
non-neutral	No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.
neutral	Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
neutral	Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
neutral	So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.
neutral	We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
joy	Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.
surprise	Yeah?
joy	Yeah!
neutral	Just go for it Chandler.
neutral	Yeah, you should.
neutral	Yeah, you should, really.
neutral	Go on.
neutral	All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. But Im just doing it for you guys.
non-neutral	: Im sure as hell a dancer, its no use Marge will never go for me.
non-neutral	Come on Treeger, dont say that.
neutral	You just ahh, you just need more practice.
neutral	Here, come on, lets ahh, lets try it again.
neutral	Come on.
non-neutral	Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.
non-neutral	I mean, yknow, Im not really that comfortable dancing with a We-he!!
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	: Yeah!
neutral	Oh, I
neutral	Are you sure? Ill bet theres another flight to Minsk in like
neutral	July. Umm,
non-neutral	Thats really beautiful. What does it mean?
neutral	Please, clean my beakers. I dont get out of the lab much.
non-neutral	Thats good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
neutral	Yeah, I Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldnt because yknow, Ihave to leave.
non-neutral	Youre right! Youre right. Dont say it.
non-neutral	I-I do though.
non-neutral	I do too.
neutral	Bye Phoebe.
non-neutral	Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
neutral	I know.
surprise	Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that?
non-neutral	Listen, Im gettin something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
neutral	No, I do not hear that.
joy	Yeah, I-I heard.  I think its great!  Ohh, Im so happy for you!
joy	Oh, well, thats great!
joy	Yeah! Yeah!
joy	I cant believe youre getting married!
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Monica and Rachel made out.
surprise	Ohhh!
surprise	Why are we in bed together?
neutral	I dont know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
neutral	Yeah.
surprise	Really?!
neutral	No!
fear	But we-we didnt havesex-uh, did we?
neutral	I mean, I dont remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
joy	Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
neutral	And we didnt have sex.
neutral	Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. Im just glad we didnt do anything stupid.
neutral	Tell me about it.
neutral	What are we gonna do?
neutral	I say we go with
neutral	Chandler?
neutral	Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
non-neutral	Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
disgust	Whats that smell?
non-neutral	I know!
neutral	Hi, remember us?
neutral	Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a
neutral	I am. I'm
neutral	Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
sadness	Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
neutral	Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
neutral	Yknow what? It
neutral	Sorry.
joy	Im so exited!
joy	Ive been waiting for this for months!
joy	I got my hair coloured!
joy	I got new sheets!
joy	Im making him a
neutral	Um-hmm.
neutral	What am I making him by the way?
neutral	Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
surprise	I thought I was making him filet mignon?
neutral	Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.
non-neutral	And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
surprise	Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
non-neutral	Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!
non-neutral	Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated.
neutral	Yknow its like uh, Biology!
non-neutral	Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
neutral	Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.
non-neutral	Phoebe!
neutral	If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes probably not gay.
neutral	You are falling fast asleep.
neutral	Deeper.
neutral	Deeper.
neutral	Deeper.
neutral	You are now completely asleep.
neutral	You dont need to smoke.
neutral	Cigarettes dont control you.
neutral	You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
neutral	A strong, confident woman.
neutral	Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller.
joy	Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
neutral	Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
non-neutral	Of course not.
neutral	No.
neutral	Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
neutral	So how are things going with Paul?
joy	Good.
non-neutral	Although yknow, he-hes a private guy.
sadness	Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
neutral	Thats easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wont open.
surprise	So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
neutral	No thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
neutral	Hi honey.
joy	Hi!
fear	Okay, Ben, I wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident.
surprise	Monica, number one, I dont think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!
neutral	You said number two.
neutral	I also said number one.
neutral	Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
neutral	Cant I just look at the handles on them?
neutral	You would think.
neutral	Okay, fine.
non-neutral	Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why Im a terrible waitress?
neutral	Because, I dont care.
neutral	I dont care.
non-neutral	I dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I dont care where the tray spot is, I just dont care, this is not what I want to do.
non-neutral	So I dont think I should do it anymore.
non-neutral	Im gonna give you my weeks notice.
surprise	What?!
non-neutral	Gunther, I quit.
surprise	Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee?
non-neutral	Ohh, I mean its just so realistic!
neutral	I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.
joy	Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
neutral	Do you uh, do youready for a refill?
surprise	Oh, I probably shouldntso I will!  Oh! Wow! Its like its raining!
joy	Pretty cool, huh?
neutral	But if youre thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldnt get sucked up into the mechanism, well youd be wrong.
neutral	Umm, can I use your bathroom?
neutral	Its uh, right through there.
non-neutral	Okay.  God yknow, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbianis apartment
joy	Yeah, lifes pretty great isnt it?
joy	Yeah, it sure is!
neutral	You know, I think I was sixteen.
neutral	Please, just a little bit off the back.
neutral	I'm still on "no."
neutral	Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
anger	No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.
neutral	What's goin' on?
neutral	Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
non-neutral	What stupid thing did you do?
disgust	Ewww!
neutral	I know.
neutral	See, yes.
neutral	Thats Yasmine Bleeth, shes a completely different kind of chick.
neutral	I love you both.
neutral	But in very different ways.
surprise	Hey!
surprise	Hey!
neutral	(sees hes watching
non-neutral	I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
non-neutral	If they cant find a home for her, they kill her! And Im not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
non-neutral	Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
disgust	Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of other animals!
disgust	Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
joy	Thanks, Im glad you see it that way.
joy	Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
neutral	So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
non-neutral	Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
neutral	So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
neutral	Ohh, he's really shy. I-I dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
neutral	Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
non-neutral	I dont care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
surprise	Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?
neutral	I might've said that.  Why is that funny?
joy	Because I'm very happy for him!  And
non-neutral	Hi!
neutral	All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	All right, let's go say good-bye.
neutral	Hey!
anger	Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?
disgust	Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
surprise	Fish!
neutral	It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
sadness	Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here
joy	Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
joy	We did have fun, didn't we?
joy	We did!
neutral	Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
joy	Oh, I would love to!
joy	Yay, okay!
joy	Good, good, good, good, good.
neutral	Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
neutral	Um...  Done!
surprise	Youre, hey, youre not paying for the pizza!
neutral	Oh come on, its only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
neutral	Ahh, Id throw another thousand on that.
neutral	Why, how much is that?
neutral	Thats about 60 cents.
neutral	Okay, its coffee.
surprise	Ice coffee? Tell me its ice coffee!
neutral	Its-its hot
surprise	Hot coffee!!!
anger	You idiot!!
anger	You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!
anger	What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?!
non-neutral	Huh?
anger	!
neutral	Whats your favourite thing about summertime?
neutral	Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
neutral	Yeah
surprise	Hey!
joy	Tommyyyy! Say, whats your favourite thing about summer?
neutral	Ooh, I dont know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
non-neutral	Ohh, thats a good one.
neutral	OK, try this salmon mousse.
joy	Mmmm. Good.
neutral	Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
non-neutral	It's creamier.
neutral	Yeah, well, is that
disgust	I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
surprise	My God! What happened to you?
disgust	Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?
non-neutral	"You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
joy	That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
non-neutral	Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really
non-neutral	Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
joy	Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
neutral	Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
neutral	I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
non-neutral	Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
neutral	Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
neutral	I don't see why not.
neutral	Here's my retainer!
neutral	Someone in there?
non-neutral	No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.
surprise	Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
neutral	Someone was in the lady's room, I couldnt wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
neutral	Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, Im-Im talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name.

neutral	Nope, nope, Id just ah, Id rather talk to you.
neutral	Yes, I do.
neutral	Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
neutral	Someone in here.
anger	Im going to keep dating him Mother, and theres nothing you can do about it!
anger	Oh yes there is!
anger	What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
anger	That was an accident! And so were you.
anger	Well, at least Im not a murderer!
non-neutral	Oh, my baby!
surprise	That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
neutral	Oh, just years of experience.
non-neutral	Can I get some ice here?!
joy	Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
non-neutral	Youre not the fan whos dying are you?
surprise	Say what?
neutral	Im supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying, but thats not supposed to be until  later!
non-neutral	No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-Im the guy in the coma!
surprise	Oh that was a real person?!
non-neutral	An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
surprise	I-I-Im leaving the show?
neutral	I dont know. Why? Did you hear something?
surprise	Who told you that?
non-neutral	Oh uh, one of the writers.
surprise	Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
neutral	Umm
neutral	Feel better?
joy	Yeah!
joy	Much!
non-neutral	Listen uh, not that Im yknow insecure about my manhood or anything yknow, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
neutral	Yeah, I understand.
joy	Yeah! Okay!  Hey! Hi!
joy	Hi!
surprise	Yknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
neutral	I dont think so.
non-neutral	Oh! Maybe its because Im on television. Im an actor on
surprise	Wow!
neutral	Yeah.
surprise	Really?!
neutral	Hm-mmm.
neutral	$4.50 please.
neutral	Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.

non-neutral	Oh God, do something.
non-neutral	Just make contact, smile!
joy	There you go!
non-neutral	You're definitely scaring here.
neutral	Would you like to call somebody?
neutral	Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.
anger	Okay! Feel free to look, but Im telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
neutral	Oh
neutral	Its my sister.
neutral	Okay, very cute braces. Anyway yknow what, the

neutral	In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a
neutral	Phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, she doesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know that youve been living with your Grandmothers for a week now.
neutral	Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey.
sadness	Im never gonna find a roommate, ever.
neutral	Why, nobody good?
disgust	Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural.
disgust	The spitter.
non-neutral	Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.
neutral	Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing
neutral	So how many more do you have tomorrow?
neutral	Two.
neutral	This photographer, who seemed really dull.
neutral	And this actor guy, who Im not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone Chandler Bing, he said Whoa-whoa, short message.
neutral	Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
non-neutral	Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.

joy	Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesnt really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think its gonna make a difference
neutral	Hey!
neutral	Hi!
non-neutral	What-what are-what are these?
joy	Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought theyd brighten up the place. They do dont you think?
non-neutral	No-no-no, no!
neutral	Well, how-how come?
neutral	Thats just the way it is.
surprise	Thats crazy.
neutral	Maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.
neutral	See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now Peter!
neutral	Hey, Peter!

neutral	Op.
non-neutral	Eh.
neutral	Oh, you got me.
neutral	Well, dont think I havent noticed your potential.
neutral	Well, Ive got a project for you thats a lot more related to fashion.
neutral	How does that sound?
joy	Oh, that sounds great.
neutral	Come on over here, sweetheart.
joy	Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
fear	Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe youd want to get back together?
neutral	No. But thanks.
sadness	Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
neutral	Okay. No. But thanks.
neutral	Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
surprise	Wow, that was kinda brutal.
neutral	Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.
neutral	Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, yknow.
neutral	Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,
neutral	Yeah, sure.
surprise	Wow.
neutral	I'm, I'm really sorry.
neutral	Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
surprise	Relieved?
neutral	Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
neutral	She wants
anger	Oh my God! If you say that one more time,
anger	Fine!
anger	Fine!
anger	But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  If you accept full responsibility...  Full responsibility!
anger	...I can begin to trust you again.
anger	Does that seem like something you can do.
anger	Does it?!
anger	!
surprise	No?
neutral	Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel.
neutral	If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
sadness	Yeah, I know.
sadness	I mean, no, youre right.
neutral	Yeah I guess Ill let it go.
sadness	But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
neutral	Sure, its hard to forget!
neutral	But that doesnt mean you have to talk about it!
neutral	A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.
surprise	What the hell happened on that beach?!
neutral	Its between us and the sea, Ross!
non-neutral	I didnt think you were gay. I do now.
neutral	See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
sadness	Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious.
neutral	Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
surprise	Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
neutral	Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
joy	Oh wow! Im free for her!
surprise	Oh, wait a second! I didnt say I wasnt free!
neutral	Hey, Chandler, why dont we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
neutral	Hold on, yknow I
non-neutral	Oh well, thats uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
neutral	Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
neutral	Well, I dont really know what that is, but
neutral	Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
neutral	Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
disgust	Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
surprise	What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.

non-neutral	Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.

neutral	So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
non-neutral	Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome.  I'm talking to Rome.
non-neutral	Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
non-neutral	So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
non-neutral	Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
neutral	Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
surprise	You know it?
neutral	Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
neutral	Oh, sure, they love us over there.
joy	Ben! Ben! Ben!
anger	Gimme em!
anger	No! They are mine!
anger	You stole them from me!
anger	You stole them from me!!
anger	Gimme them!
neutral	You just wanna each take one?
neutral	Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
non-neutral	Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
neutral	Well
neutral	Why dont you phase it out?
non-neutral	Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think youre, yknow, that youre adjusting to life in America.
neutral	Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean theyre probably not even listening!
surprise	Theyre not listening too me?
neutral	Of course theyre listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
non-neutral	Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
neutral	I think you look fine.
neutral	How about Joey... Pepponi?
neutral	No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
neutral	Joey... Switzerland?
neutral	Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.
non-neutral	Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.
neutral	Which I'm not.
non-neutral	Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
neutral	Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
neutral	Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
non-neutral	Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
neutral	Might wanna try Joseph.
non-neutral	Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
joy	Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
surprise	Are you kidding?
neutral	Okay, look.
non-neutral	I-I studied evolution.
non-neutral	Remember, evolution?
non-neutral	Monkey into man?
neutral	Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey.
non-neutral	Im Doctor Monkey!
neutral	Im not arguing with that.
non-neutral	All right, Ive heard enough. Ive made my decision.
disgust	You are both idiots.
disgust	The joke is not funny, and its offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys!
anger	You shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!
anger	Now let it go!
anger	The joke sucks!
neutral	Its your joke.
anger	Is not.
non-neutral	Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
joy	I didnt!
neutral	Even when I found outumm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
non-neutral	Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
surprise	Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
neutral	Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and

neutral	So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
anger	Oh, DAMN IT!
neutral	Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
neutral	Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.
