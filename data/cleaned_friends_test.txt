__label__surprise Why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
__label__non-neutral Oh. Thats so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, Wheres number 27?!
__label__neutral Y'know what?
__label__neutral It didnt.
__label__joy Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what Ive got with Alice.
__label__surprise Now, wh-what, what is that like?
__label__joy Its so cool man, its so, its just cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah.
__label__non-neutral Why cant I find that?
__label__anger Dont ask me, I had it and I blew it!
__label__non-neutral Well, I want it!
__label__non-neutral You can have it!
__label__non-neutral I dont know, maybe I cant. I mean, maybe theres something wrong with me.
__label__non-neutral Oh, no! No!
__label__joy Its out there man! Ive seen it! I got it!!
__label__non-neutral Then you hold on to it!!
__label__joy All right, man!!
__label__joy All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
__label__neutral Come on, Lydia, you can do it.
__label__joy Push!
__label__joy Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder.
__label__joy Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out!
__label__joy Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho.
__label__joy Let's  I was justyeah, right.
__label__joy Push!
__label__joy Push!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
__label__non-neutral Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
__label__surprise Okay, go left. Left! Left!
__label__anger Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
__label__non-neutral Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!
__label__non-neutral Straight up over your head!
__label__joy You can do it!
__label__joy You can do it!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral You got it?
__label__neutral Oh, okay, I get it.
__label__fear No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even
__label__neutral Howard's the
__label__neutral Yes but too me he's just, man.
__label__non-neutral Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
__label__disgust Ugh, can you believe that guy!
__label__neutral Yeah. I really like his glasses.
__label__surprise Ohh!
__label__neutral What?
__label__surprise It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__neutral Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
__label__fear Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
__label__disgust Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!
__label__non-neutral Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I dont have time!
__label__neutral Theyre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
__label__non-neutral Youre coming on to the entire room!  Im Chandler.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral You mind if I
__label__neutral No, please.
__label__neutral So uh, what are you in for?
__label__neutral I talk in my sleep.
__label__neutral What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
__label__neutral So why dont you give me your number?
__label__neutral Previously on Friends.
__label__neutral I dont know exactly. Its-its sorta like wrestling.
__label__surprise Oh?!
__label__neutral Yeah, but without the costumes.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral And its not fake, its totally brutal.
__label__neutral Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Theyre
__label__surprise So you can like, bite, and pull peoples hair and stuff?
__label__neutral Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
__label__surprise Whats fish hooking?
__label__neutral Huh, whats fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
__label__non-neutral What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
__label__non-neutral Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
__label__joy Well, that makes me feel so good.
__label__neutral It was just so awkward and bumpy.
__label__surprise Bumpy?
__label__neutral Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.
__label__neutral And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
__label__non-neutral Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
__label__non-neutral Coming through!  Oh! Coming through!  Oh! Hello! Hi!  No! Right! Coming through!
__label__neutral Oh well, its not so bad.
__label__sadness Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__surprise My God!
__label__neutral Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
__label__surprise Excuse me?
__label__non-neutral Joey! Hes working!  You would look
__label__non-neutral Oh, how bad is it?
__label__sadness Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that isnt burned is an ass. Which I do
__label__neutral Hows your room Rach?
__label__sadness Everythings ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
__label__neutral Isnt that mine?
__label__non-neutral Fine! Im sorry for your loss!
__label__neutral So uh, youre not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
__label__non-neutral Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am
__label__neutral Yes, they can stay with us.
__label__neutral Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
__label__non-neutral Theres just so much pressure.
__label__neutral I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.
__label__neutral I dont know if youd understand.
__label__neutral Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
__label__non-neutral Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!
__label__neutral Well, yknow.
__label__fear I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time.
__label__neutral So Im gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on.
__label__neutral Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Whats all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
__label__neutral Ross, we can handle this.
__label__sadness Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.
__label__anger I mean, enough of the silliness!
__label__anger Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!
__label__non-neutral Okay-okay!
__label__non-neutral Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together.
__label__non-neutral Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?
__label__non-neutral That is so silly.
__label__neutral Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
__label__neutral Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
__label__joy Love is the best medicine.
__label__non-neutral Thats laughter.
__label__neutral Why do you do it?
__label__neutral I dont know.
__label__neutral Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
__label__neutral Yeah, I do.
__label__neutral And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, dont ya?
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__joy Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
__label__neutral Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
__label__surprise You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
__label__neutral Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.
__label__non-neutral Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!
__label__non-neutral Define me!
__label__non-neutral Love me, I need love!
__label__neutral '.
__label__surprise Have you really done this before?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral You just take a big, big swing.
__label__neutral Now, dont hold back.
__label__neutral and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey-hey-hey!
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__joy Were just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
__label__neutral Oh, all right.
__label__joy Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
__label__joy Okay!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Bye!
__label__neutral Bye!
__label__non-neutral Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
__label__neutral Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey.
__label__neutral Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
__label__neutral Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
__label__surprise Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one!
__label__neutral Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials?
__label__non-neutral Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down?
__label__neutral Because we can remember them.
__label__non-neutral Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
__label__neutral Hey. When you guys were kids and you played
__label__neutral I was always Joanne.
__label__neutral Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! the war cry of your neighbourhood?
__label__disgust Ewww! Oh! Its the Mattress King!
__label__non-neutral Booo!!
__label__disgust Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
__label__joy Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
__label__anger What a wank!
__label__anger Oh, I cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses.
__label__non-neutral I know!
__label__non-neutral And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.
__label__non-neutral And Im appalled for you by the way.
__label__non-neutral You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it alone.
__label__disgust Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my food.
__label__anger Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
__label__disgust Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
__label__neutral Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
__label__fear Im, Im freaking out!
__label__fear Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have!
__label__neutral All right, I havent lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.
__label__neutral Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
__label__neutral Um. yeah.
__label__neutral I am
__label__neutral All right, look, heres the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.
__label__neutral So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
__label__non-neutral Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work.
__label__neutral Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but thats why you have got to be the bigger man here.
__label__non-neutral Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me!
__label__non-neutral Like me tiny doctor!
__label__non-neutral Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
__label__non-neutral Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along.
__label__anger Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.
__label__non-neutral Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna have to have a separate room for you too!
__label__anger !
__label__neutral Okay, okay, okay.  Ill get the bagels.
__label__neutral Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
__label__neutral All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
__label__neutral Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
__label__surprise Really? A purse?
__label__non-neutral It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
__label__neutral It looks like a women's purse.
__label__neutral No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,
__label__neutral See look,
__label__neutral Exactly! Unisex!
__label__neutral Maybe you need sex.
__label__non-neutral No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
__label__neutral Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
__label__neutral So, um, have you told your parents?
__label__neutral No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__neutral You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.
__label__neutral .
__label__neutral .
__label__non-neutral no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.
__label__joy I love you Phoebe.
__label__surprise So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral I just came over to drop offnothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, it did.
__label__sadness So, I guess this is over.
__label__neutral What?
__label__sadness Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
__label__non-neutral Why, exactly?
__label__sadness Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
__label__surprise Chandler that's crazy!
__label__anger If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!
__label__neutral So, this isn't over?
__label__joy You are so cute!
__label__non-neutral No.
__label__neutral No, it was a fight.
__label__non-neutral You deal with it and move on!
__label__neutral It's nothing to freak out about.
__label__joy Really? Okay. Great!
__label__joy Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
__label__surprise We're in a relationship?
__label__neutral I'm afraid so.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral So you like the short hair better.
__label__neutral What? YetiI mean Danny?
__label__neutral Can I tell you a little secret?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral I want to keep one.
__label__joy Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
__label__neutral Oh, please.
__label__neutral What? Honey.
__label__neutral Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
__label__sadness Oh God, Im so sorry.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__non-neutral Ow!!
__label__surprise Oh God!
__label__non-neutral Hey, you guys! Guess what?
__label__neutral Got a job on a river boat?
__label__non-neutral Y'know what I didnt wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? Youre not my girlfriend anymore so...
__label__neutral Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
__label__neutral Right.
__label__non-neutral Now that youre on youre own, youre free to look as stupid as you like.
__label__neutral You like it right?
__label__neutral Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! Im kidding!
__label__neutral Yeah, come here!
__label__neutral What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
__label__neutral Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
__label__anger Okay, good bye!
__label__joy Hey I got one! I got one!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Oh uh, up or down?
__label__non-neutral Oh down please.  I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?
__label__neutral Could you press up too please?
__label__sadness Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
__label__neutral Oh yeah? Howd yours happen?
__label__neutral Well, its a long story.
__label__neutral Its kind of embarrassing.
__label__non-neutral Lets just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
__label__neutral How about you?
__label__sadness Car accident.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__non-neutral Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasnt paying attention?
__label__neutral Yeah. Me.  Oh hey, thats me.  Hey uh, I take it youre just visiting someone.
__label__neutral Uh-huh, yeah.
__label__neutral Well umm, if you have sometime yknow and maybe you might want to visit someone else
__label__joy Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
__label__neutral Im in the middle
__label__anger Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
__label__neutral Uh, you gotta press the button.
__label__neutral Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
__label__surprise Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
__label__neutral Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car.    We're way ahead of the game.
__label__surprise Oh my god.
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise There's something new in the bowl.
__label__non-neutral Look, we have enough, just walk away.
__label__joy No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
__label__neutral There's a forest right outside.
__label__neutral It's not the same.
__label__non-neutral Ok, go quick!
__label__joy Thank you for a delightful stay.
__label__joy Oh, my maple candy!
__label__surprise Oh my God, what happened?
__label__non-neutral Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
__label__joy Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
__label__non-neutral Oh,  I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
__label__surprise Ross's what?
__label__disgust You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.
__label__neutral Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
__label__surprise Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! Thats my Dad, thats Frank! Yeah! Im sorry Im getting all flingy.
__label__joy Take it easy--if you want, theres cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria!  I can make sangria!
__label__neutral No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral Well, so, umm, anyway umm, Ive been, Ive been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
__label__sadness Oh no, I-Im sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.
__label__neutral Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
__label__neutral Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.
__label__surprise Oh, what? What was it?
__label__non-neutral The three losers.
__label__sadness Oh, poor Lily.
__label__sadness Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, no, it was great.
__label__sadness Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her,  burping her, oh try this one!
__label__anger Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
__label__neutral Alright here's something, it says to try holding the baby  close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__surprise It worked!
__label__non-neutral Oh  oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit.
__label__non-neutral Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it  won't stop crying.
__label__neutral Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
__label__neutral Yeah, I'm not so sure.
__label__non-neutral Oh my god, I am losing my mind.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from  having sex with Ross!
__label__neutral Well, youre not.
__label__disgust Oh, its so easy for you I mean, youre not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
__label__joy Yeah I can!  And dont think I dont, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
__label__surprise Monica. Youve, youve done it right?
__label__anger Of course I have! What do you think, Im some 30 year old virgin?
__label__surprise Oh my God! Youre a 30 year old virgin!
__label__disgust Say it louder, I dont think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
__label__anger Its not like, I havent any opportunities.
__label__neutral I mean, yknow, Im just waiting for the perfect guy.
__label__neutral Im seeing this guy Roger, all right?
__label__neutral Hes not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.
__label__neutral Yknow, give him my flower.
__label__surprise Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, youve waited
__label__surprise Yknow what? You are right?!
__label__joy Yes!!
__label__non-neutral I mean sex does not have to be a big deal!
__label__non-neutral There shouldnt be all this rules and restrictions!
__label__neutral Yknow, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever
__label__non-neutral Rachel! Im never gonna think its okay for you to cheat on your husband!
__label__non-neutral Oh what do you know? Virgin!
__label__neutral Push, push!
__label__non-neutral We're here!
__label__neutral Where have you been?
__label__neutral Long story, honey.
__label__neutral All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?
__label__neutral C'mon up.
__label__non-neutral Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
__label__anger So, I hear, you hate me!
__label__neutral I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
__label__non-neutral A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
__label__non-neutral And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
__label__anger All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.
__label__neutral So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.
__label__non-neutral But what does that gonna do...
__label__non-neutral For Chandler!
__label__joy Guess what, I got an audition!
__label__joy Awww, one of my students got an audition. Im so proud.
__label__neutral I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
__label__joy You bet! Whats the part?
__label__joy Oh its great, its a role on
__label__neutral Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
__label__neutral I thought he was with you.
__label__neutral He-he was with me umm, were playing a little game, yknow? Hide and seek.
__label__neutral You cant ask us son, thats cheating.
__label__neutral Youre right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
__label__neutral Well, he better not come by here. He cant see the bride in the wedding dress.
__label__non-neutral As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
__label__neutral But that was after the wedding, its not bad luck then.
__label__neutral Honey, it isnt good luck.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Monica!
__label__neutral I know! Hey, hows Chandler doin?
__label__neutral Great. Hes doing great. Dont you worry about Chandler.
__label__neutral Are you okay?
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__joy Yeah baby!
__label__neutral Im really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.
__label__neutral So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
__label__non-neutral I cant believe it! He still hasnt called.
__label__surprise Who, Josh?
__label__non-neutral Its Joshua.
__label__surprise What, he doesnt like Josh?
__label__disgust No, I dont.
__label__neutral All right, well Im gonna put my sweats back on.
__label__surprise Oh no!
__label__fear Wait!
__label__surprise Wait!
__label__non-neutral Okay, yknow what, you were right, you were right.
__label__non-neutral We really werent great at being guys, but you know why?
__label__neutral Because were girls.
__label__neutral Phoebe, his music could not
__label__joy Thank you, thanks.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I lost it.
__label__neutral Yknow, Im not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?
__label__surprise After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
__label__neutral Yeah, like I could
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral I played bad on purpose guys.
__label__surprise Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
__label__neutral Yeahno, just that last song.
__label__neutral Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, whos playing?
__label__neutral The players.
__label__neutral Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
__label__neutral Please, its a relief is what it is, is what it is.
__label__neutral All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral Anything?
__label__non-neutral No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasnt heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandlers parents again!
__label__non-neutral You told them he was missing?
__label__neutral No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think Im interested in them.
__label__neutral Whose is it?
__label__neutral I dont want to say.
__label__non-neutral Oh, come on! I dont care! Come on! Whose is it?
__label__neutral Diane Keaton.
__label__anger Phoebe! Come on! Lets go!  Come on!  Why arent you dressed yet?!
__label__neutral Im sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
__label__neutral No, Phoebe, Ill tell you what, if you get ready now Ill let you play it at the wedding.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__joy Oh thats so exciting!
__label__joy Thank you!
__label__joy Thanks Mon!
__label__anger Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again Ill have to pound on you for a little bit.
__label__neutral Fair enough, now go get ready!
__label__neutral Okay.

__label__neutral Look, Im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
__label__sadness Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
__label__neutral Not once did we do that.

__label__neutral I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
__label__neutral I'm
__label__neutral I know, me too.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__non-neutral Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?
__label__joy Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
__label__non-neutral All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
__label__neutral Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
__label__joy Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!

__label__neutral Wait! What about Joey?
__label__neutral Oh umm, theres also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?

__label__non-neutral Im so sorry!
__label__non-neutral Sorry!
__label__neutral You didnt bring
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
__label__neutral Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
__label__disgust To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, youre
__label__neutral No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
__label__surprise Oh, youre switching apartments?
__label__neutral Its not for me, its for Rachel.
__label__neutral But Rachel has an apartment.
__label__neutral Yeah, but when the baby comes shes gonna want to move.
__label__surprise She is?
__label__surprise Yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you?
__label__neutral I guess I didnt really think about it.
__label__non-neutral Ezel!  Hey Gunther! Youre an ezel!
__label__anger Damnit!
__label__surprise Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people?
__label__neutral Little village people.
__label__joy Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
__label__joy Oh, that is so sweet!
__label__joy I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
__label__neutral Huh. Except, Phoebes not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
__label__sadness Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies.
__label__sadness Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
__label__surprise Wait a minute!
__label__joy Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after shes done being pregnant.
__label__neutral Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
__label__joy Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants shes always wanted!
__label__joy Oh, shes gonna love that!
__label__neutral Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
__label__neutral Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
__label__neutral So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
__label__anger Fine, Im mentally unstable.
__label__neutral And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Uh yes, heroin and crack.
__label__anger Crack isnt even an intravenous drug!
__label__neutral Well, you would know.
__label__neutral Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
__label__non-neutral Oh, come on!
__label__non-neutral Ross, please, I found the magazines!
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__neutral Phoebe just because I'm alone doesnt mean I wanna walk around naked.
__label__neutral I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
__label__non-neutral Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
__label__sadness I know, I lied! I didnt want her to think I was a terrible mother! I cant even see my own baby!
__label__neutral Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  its-its-its, its right there .
__label__joy Oh. Oh, its beautiful. I see it now.
__label__neutral Do you really?
__label__anger No, I dont see it!
__label__joy Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this?  This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy Sweetie thats it.
__label__joy Thats it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
__label__neutral Youre welcome.
__label__surprise Wow! I cant believe thats our baby.
__label__joy Yeah, thats our baby.
__label__neutral Gin.
__label__joy We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
__label__non-neutral Will you stop!
__label__neutral Okay. All right.
__label__joy Okay, all right, I think youre great, I think youre sweet, and youre smart, and I love you.
__label__disgust But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
__label__joy Hey, check me out, Im a slut!
__label__neutral So you uh, want to do something tonight?
__label__neutral Oh I cant. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__surprise Oh right!
__label__surprise Right!
__label__sadness Because youre still seeing him and uh, hes a good guy.
__label__sadness I mean, I remember a time when
__label__neutral Are you okay?
__label__joy Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
__label__joy Great! Its so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was
__label__neutral I bet he can.
__label__neutral Yknow, I dont have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure youre okay?
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah! Yeah! Dont worry about me, Ill be fine!
__label__neutral You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
__label__neutral Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
__label__non-neutral Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby?
__label__neutral Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
__label__non-neutral oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks.
__label__surprise I can't believe    I didn't even think of that.
__label__non-neutral I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...
__label__non-neutral What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?
__label__non-neutral It was a "Wendy's!!    "
__label__surprise ...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
__label__disgust Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else?
__label__surprise Like you, I dont even know where you work?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__anger So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
__label__neutral Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think Ill show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
__label__non-neutral Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
__label__non-neutral Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
__label__non-neutral Yeah!
__label__neutral Well, Im not going to go now anyway .
__label__neutral Okay .
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__neutral Ah, Gunther, I cant pay for this right now because Im not working, so Ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin for stuff.
__label__neutral Well, if you want, you can work here.
__label__neutral Uh, I dont know.
__label__neutral Ya see, its just, see I was a regular on a soap opera yknow?
__label__sadness And to go from that to this, I just Plus, Id have to wait on all my friends.
__label__neutral Okay, but the moneys good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Flexible hours.
__label__neutral Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
__label__neutral I have no name.
__label__neutral All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
__label__neutral Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
__label__disgust No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
__label__surprise Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
__label__neutral Umm, Gene.
__label__anger Its Clint. Its Clint!
__label__neutral See you later, Gene.
__label__neutral Bye, Gene.
__label__anger Its Clint!
__label__non-neutral Whats up with Gene?
__label__neutral Welcome to Las Vegas.
__label__joy Thank you!  Enjoy your flight?
__label__joy Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
__label__neutral Hope you had a nice flight.
__label__joy Ohh, it was the best!
__label__neutral Oh, Larry.
__label__neutral Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
__label__neutral No, bribes.
__label__non-neutral It's okay to laugh right?
__label__non-neutral Come on Joey!!!
__label__non-neutral Rach, I told you everything I knew last night!
__label__neutral Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
__label__non-neutral I can't believe you would say that!
__label__neutral Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
__label__non-neutral No! I mean come on! This is a
__label__neutral I don't know.
__label__non-neutral Is he romantic with her?
__label__neutral I don't know.
__label__non-neutral Are they in love?
__label__neutral I don't know.
__label__anger You don't know anything.
__label__non-neutral Ohh, I know one thing!
__label__non-neutral What?
__label__non-neutral They did it right there on the couch.
__label__non-neutral Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in.
__label__non-neutral I mean, that guy with the toe thing?
__label__neutral Who's he sleeping with?
__label__neutral Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...
__label__neutral I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.
__label__non-neutral Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-!
__label__neutral So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.
__label__neutral So where did you study?
__label__neutral Oh, I didn't go to college.
__label__neutral No, where did you study acting?
__label__neutral Molly ... people don't study acting ...
__label__neutral Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
__label__neutral Sure, I'll go check on Emma.
__label__neutral Thanx.
__label__sadness Will the stable boy never get the princess??
__label__disgust What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here    on my couch?
__label__non-neutral No ... the leather sticks to my ass.
__label__anger You know, this isn't fair.
__label__anger What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?
__label__non-neutral Huh?
__label__anger Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?
__label__non-neutral Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?
__label__sadness I didn't think I could ever love again.
__label__non-neutral Come on! Joe!
__label__neutral Ok
__label__neutral Hi, is Molly here?
__label__neutral Yeah, come on in. Molly?
__label__neutral Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha .  I'll see you tomorrow.
__label__neutral Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess    we have no problem.
__label__joy It's like my favorite fairy tale come true!  The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!
__label__non-neutral And whats cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral My whole familys from Naples!

__label__neutral I totally understand.
__label__non-neutral You need to yknow make sure I dont have any horrible scars or tattoos.
__label__non-neutral Dont you worry; I have nothing to hide.
__label__neutral So there you go, thats me.
__label__joy One hundred percent natural!
__label__non-neutral I tell ya, that has never happened before.
__label__neutral This rooms available.
__label__joy Okay!
__label__non-neutral Okay wait!
__label__anger You listen to me!
__label__anger You listen to me!
__label__non-neutral Since I have been waiting four women, thats four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies!
__label__anger Im next!
__label__anger Its my turn!
__label__anger Its only fair!
__label__anger And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me Im going to sue you!
__label__anger Not this hospital, Im going to sue you!
__label__non-neutral And my husband  hes a lawyer!
__label__neutral Uh Rach
__label__anger Go get back on that case honey!
__label__neutral I dont think the next patient is very far along.
__label__neutral Okay, well then bring her in.
__label__surprise OH.MY.GAWD!!!
__label__fear Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that oneDude! Theyre all huge!
__label__non-neutral They dont look any bigger than me!
__label__non-neutral Well, maybe thats because youre closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
__label__neutral Im just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__joy Whoa!  I kinda liked it.
__label__non-neutral Okay, I know what I have to do. Ive got to go Red Ross.  Yknow, Red Ross!
__label__non-neutral I totally dont know what youre talking about.
__label__non-neutral Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for
__label__non-neutral Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
__label__neutral No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportive like crazy.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral We just want you to think it through.
__label__neutral Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody whos had a baby. Like your mom?
__label__neutral My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
__label__neutral Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
__label__neutral Thank you. All right.
__label__neutral Come, sit.
__label__neutral Sit.
__label__anger Sit!
__label__neutral Umm, all righty, before we get started I justI need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
__label__neutral Lucky sixes....
__label__neutral Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
__label__neutral Hi!
__label__neutral And Joey....
__label__neutral Hi!
__label__neutral And Ross.
__label__neutral Hi!
__label__neutral He doesn't speak much English.
__label__surprise Look at that!
__label__neutral So, um... where did Paolo come from?
__label__neutral Oh... Italy, I think.
__label__neutral No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
__label__neutral Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
__label__neutral That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
__label__neutral Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
__label__neutral Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
__label__non-neutral Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
__label__neutral Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
__label__non-neutral You betcha!
__label__surprise Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
__label__neutral When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
__label__anger That cup is mine!
__label__anger No its not! You want it, youre gonna have to win it!
__label__non-neutral All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
__label__non-neutral Why?
__label__neutral Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
__label__neutral I know I do.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Guess what?
__label__neutral What?
__label__joy They published my paper.
__label__joy Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
__label__non-neutral Rach, look!  Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.  There he is.
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__anger What?! You got us evicted!!
__label__anger I told you not to go down there!
__label__disgust Well he made Rachel cry!
__label__anger Rachel always cries!
__label__anger Thats not true!
__label__neutral Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like youve never sucked before!
__label__neutral All right! Ill try! But if I cant, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
__label__anger Go!!
__label__neutral All right, all right, all right.
__label__neutral I mean Ill have to check with him first, but Ill think hell be cool with it.
__label__non-neutral So, hes just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesnt want anything in exchange for helping him?
__label__neutral Well, I assume Ill have to take showers with him, but y'know, thats true of any job.
__label__neutral How ya feelin?
__label__neutral Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it.
__label__neutral Whered you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
__label__joy Woooo hoooo!!!
__label__non-neutral Ow, no woo-hooing, no woo-hooing.
__label__surprise Why, what happened?
__label__non-neutral Ah, I fooled around with Joeys sister.  Well, thats not the worst part.
__label__neutral What is the worse part?
__label__non-neutral I cant remember which sister.
__label__anger You see what men do! Dont tell me men are not nice!  This is men!!
__label__non-neutral Whats wrong with you?
__label__anger Nothing!
__label__sadness Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.
__label__neutral But um, I dont think its anything serious.
__label__surprise This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-youGo to the doctor!
__label__anger No way!
__label__non-neutral Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
__label__disgust Why did I have to start working out again?
__label__anger Damn you 15s!
__label__neutral Its a trifle.
__label__neutral Its got all of these layers.
__label__neutral First theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.
__label__non-neutral [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like somethings wrong.]
__label__neutral then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
__label__disgust It tastes like feet!
__label__joy I like it.
__label__surprise Are you kidding?
__label__neutral Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
__label__neutral No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
__label__joy Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
__label__joy Oh, oh! It's on again!
__label__disgust You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
__label__anger Shhhh!
__label__neutral Folks, has this ever happened to you.
__label__neutral You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
__label__non-neutral Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!
__label__neutral And there is Kevin.
__label__non-neutral Can we please turn this off?
__label__non-neutral Noo way, Kevin.
__label__neutral There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
__label__surprise Are you intrigued?
__label__joy You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
__label__non-neutral Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.
__label__neutral Go ahead.
__label__neutral This works with any milk carton.
__label__surprise Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.
__label__neutral Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay.
__label__non-neutral She is not  Shes gay. Oh my God. She is
__label__surprise Good day for married people huh?
__label__sadness Im sorry your husband cheated on you.
__label__non-neutral Im sorry your wife is gay. I guess women arent that great either.
__label__non-neutral Try telling my wife that.
__label__neutral Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
__label__joy I can't wait to be with you!
__label__neutral I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.
__label__neutral I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
__label__non-neutral Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
__label__non-neutral Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
__label__disgust Arghh!!
__label__non-neutral I cant believe Im going to lose this job!
__label__sadness Oh Im so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
__label__neutral Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
__label__neutral Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__anger Well, I dont want to talk to you Wayne!
__label__anger I hate you!
__label__anger You ruined my life!
__label__neutral Oh, Chandler, Wayne.
__label__neutral Wayne, Chandler.
__label__neutral Hi, how are ya?
__label__neutral Joey, Joey, I-I-Ill g-get you your job back if you help me out.
__label__non-neutral Why should I help you?!
__label__neutral The reason he just said.
__label__neutral What do you need?
__label__neutral I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, yknow Sarah?
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral And I too am just a love machine.
__label__neutral Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
__label__surprise Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out its a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
__label__joy See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
__label__surprise You chipped in?!
__label__neutral Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
__label__surprise Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, but they didn't ask me!
__label__non-neutral Y'know?
__label__joy This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger.
__label__joy That's always fun to be.
__label__anger Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
__label__neutral No I'm not.
__label__surprise No!
__label__non-neutral If anything I'm making you look better!
__label__joy They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
__label__joy Oh hey, Pheebs!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Oh hey, Ross.
__label__fear Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people.
__label__neutral Something to think about.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, okay, my bad.
__label__neutral Alright, alright, alright...
__label__neutral Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
__label__neutral For what?
__label__joy Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
__label__disgust Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
__label__joy Thank you!
__label__neutral Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
__label__non-neutral He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
__label__disgust C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!
__label__neutral I warned you...
__label__anger Who is being loud?
__label__neutral Oh, that would be Monica.
__label__neutral Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
__label__surprise Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
__label__neutral Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
__label__surprise Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
__label__neutral No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it.
__label__neutral 'Kay?
__label__neutral Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life?
__label__neutral Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
__label__neutral Sure.
__label__neutral Oh, um, Chandler?
__label__neutral Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
__label__joy Hey Monica, it's Joey!
__label__joy Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
__label__neutral Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
__label__neutral Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?
__label__neutral Do you have a dressing room?
__label__neutral Do you have a chair with your name on it?
__label__neutral Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on.
__label__neutral Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong!
__label__fear Uh-oh!
__label__neutral I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
__label__neutral Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
__label__joy Everybody smile!  Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at
__label__surprise Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
__label__non-neutral Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
__label__surprise Wow, you guys, this is big.
__label__non-neutral Pants and a sweater?
__label__non-neutral Why, mom?
__label__non-neutral Who am I gonna meet in a blackout?
__label__non-neutral Power company guys?
__label__non-neutral Eligible looters?
__label__non-neutral Could we talk about this later?
__label__neutral OK.
__label__neutral Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma.  What's my number?
__label__neutral Well, I never call
__label__neutral What cha doing?
__label__neutral Having a swim.
__label__neutral What about the chick?
__label__neutral Chicks dont swim.
__label__neutral Are you sure?
__label__neutral I dont know. Should we try it?
__label__neutral Sure.
__label__neutral See, I told you they dont swim.
__label__neutral Wait. Give him a minute.
__label__fear Noo!  Oh, its okay, its okay, baby, baby, baby.
__label__neutral Me taking care of you is no problem, huh?
__label__neutral You guys feel safe.
__label__neutral Right?
__label__neutral Okay, Im gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!"
__label__neutral Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, Ill set you up with a clean one.
__label__sadness Okay, Im sorry.
__label__sadness I didnt mean to scare you.
__label__neutral I just have to clean that up.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral Cause lets face it, were at Monicas.
__label__non-neutral I broke it.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Well, thats just the way that goes.
__label__neutral Okay, good.
__label__non-neutral Why are there only two of you?
__label__non-neutral Where is Leslie?
__label__neutral Well, you cant answer.
__label__neutral Leslie?
__label__fear Where are you Leslie?
__label__non-neutral Leslie, now would be a
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
__label__neutral Oh, theres banana on it.
__label__non-neutral You said she was bald.
__label__neutral Yeah, she was bald, shes not now.
__label__surprise How could you not tell me that she has hair?
__label__neutral I dont know, I hardly ever say that about people.
__label__anger Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
__label__non-neutral Well Im sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got
__label__non-neutral Well, maybe it wont work out. Maybe Ross wont like her personality.
__label__neutral Why, does she have a bad personality?
__label__non-neutral Oh no, Bonnies the best!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__fear Do you have a minute? Id like to talk to you about something Im, Im really uncomfortable talking about.
__label__non-neutral Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
__label__non-neutral I actually had a topic in mind! Im, Im kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
__label__surprise Whoa, for like months?
__label__joy Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff yknow, sexually?
__label__surprise No!
__label__neutral Oooh, wrong answer.
__label__non-neutral Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay.  Oh, shhh!
__label__non-neutral No! No!! Its me! Its me! I-I didnt want to make any noise!
__label__non-neutral Then don't break in!!
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
__label__neutral I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
__label__disgust Then why are you smoking?
__label__non-neutral Well its very unsettling.
__label__neutral Honey, I was wondering....
__label__neutral Hmm?
__label__non-neutral Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
__label__non-neutral Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
__label__neutral Hmm.
__label__non-neutral I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
__label__non-neutral You remember not having sex in high school, right?
__label__sadness Yeah.
__label__neutral Well honey, what about you?
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
__label__neutral No.
__label__surprise Come on you gotta have one!
__label__disgust Ugh!
__label__non-neutral I dont know Monica.
__label__non-neutral It feels funny just being here.
__label__non-neutral I mean if you buy a bed from Janices ex-husband, thats like betraying Chandler.
__label__non-neutral Not at these prices.
__label__joy Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.  Woo!
__label__joy Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
__label__surprise Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandlers your friend...  Oh!
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
__label__joy You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
__label__non-neutral Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
__label__anger By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
__label__neutral That's OK.
__label__surprise Oh, are you sure?
__label__surprise Really?
__label__anger Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
__label__neutral We can't do that.
__label__surprise What? What can't you do?
__label__surprise She really said that?
__label__neutral Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...
__label__neutral But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
__label__surprise 'Tonight' tonight?
__label__joy Well, I think it's perfect.
__label__neutral Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
__label__non-neutral I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
__label__joy Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
__label__disgust Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
__label__neutral Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
__label__neutral No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
__label__joy Alright, well, be good, I love you.
__label__anger You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
__label__sadness O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
__label__anger Really stupid.
__label__non-neutral Really stupid.
__label__non-neutral And I don't even know how it happened.
__label__sadness I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.
__label__fear Are we okay now?
__label__anger Yeah. No. No...
__label__neutral Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
__label__neutral Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
__label__surprise You're kidding.
__label__neutral No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
__label__neutral Oh there it is.
__label__neutral Thats not your regular dry cleaners.
__label__disgust I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one.
__label__disgust I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral A new grocery store.
__label__non-neutral The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and thats what they gave me?
__label__anger When I get up there Im going to kick some ass.
__label__neutral Dont worry Phoebe, youre gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
__label__neutral Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
__label__neutral Oh, you didnt have to come in with me.
__label__non-neutral Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__surprise Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s Wow!
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise Im sorry, its just that youre so incredibly beautiful.
__label__neutral Oh yeah well, Im sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?
__label__non-neutral I hope you dont think Im crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
__label__neutral A little.   Now youre talking.
__label__neutral Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
__label__joy I-I-Id love to. Let me just tell my friend.
__label__joy Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
__label__neutral She mustve left.
__label__anger Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
__label__surprise Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
__label__joy That's right baby.
__label__neutral All right, let me in.
__label__non-neutral No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral He's a dropper!
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah, that's right!
__label__anger I'm not a dropper!
__label__neutral It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
__label__non-neutral It's throwing and catching!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__surprise Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
__label__non-neutral Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
__label__surprise Oh myOh good God!
__label__non-neutral I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
__label__neutral Baking it didn't help, huh?
__label__neutral All right, well the place was closed. Ill just copy it later.
__label__non-neutral Or not. Uh, Rach, why dont you just move in with me?
__label__surprise Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
__label__neutral No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no Its okay, I mean Ilook Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursdays thing, but we dont have to do that!
__label__neutral Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless youre thinking about Naked Wednesdays.
__label__joy Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
__label__joy So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
__label__neutral Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
__label__non-neutral Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
__label__disgust Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
__label__neutral I was shrieking... like a Marine.
__label__neutral All right here. Watch me execute the three Ps of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.
__label__neutral She's not much of a phone person.
__label__neutral Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
__label__non-neutral Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
__label__neutral Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
__label__non-neutral Maybe you should.
__label__non-neutral Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
__label__neutral You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
__label__neutral Oh, that is so not true.
__label__neutral Oh, it is.
__label__neutral It isn't.
__label__neutral It is.
__label__anger Isn't!
__label__neutral Okay ladies, that ends todays class, and lets remember, lets be safe out there.
__label__joy Its a great class.
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah, I was watching.
__label__neutral Umm, hey, a couple of questions though.
__label__non-neutral Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
__label__neutral Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them
__label__non-neutral No. No-no. No. What would
__label__surprise Who? Me the attacker?
__label__sadness Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you.
__label__sadness Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
__label__surprise No-noReally?!
__label__non-neutral Of course!
__label__sadness Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh
__label__sadness Ohh, Im sorry.
__label__neutral Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
__label__non-neutral What?! Anything! Anything!
__label__neutral Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.
__label__non-neutral This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
__label__surprise Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
__label__neutral Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later.
__label__neutral Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over here. All right, come on
__label__non-neutral Hey, you guys. Listen, Im sorry that I was hogging the game beforeOh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
__label__neutral Theyre all Chandler.
__label__surprise Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good!
__label__neutral I did.  But it came at a price.
__label__fear But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.
__label__surprise Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!
__label__joy Sure!
__label__neutral Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?
__label__joy With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!
__label__joy And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!
__label__neutral Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much.
__label__joy Well, I like that idea.
__label__joy Obviously!
__label__neutral I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow?
__label__neutral I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like
__label__disgust No.
__label__non-neutral Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely."
__label__disgust Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
__label__surprise So, thats it?
__label__neutral I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
__label__neutral Which is why
__label__anger What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
__label__non-neutral I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
__label__non-neutral Are you mocking me?
__label__neutral No, Im not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.
__label__joy Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
__label__joy Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
__label__neutral Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but
__label__neutral Cat.
__label__joy Yes! You are so smart!  I love you.
__label__joy I love you too.
__label__non-neutral I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
__label__surprise Why?
__label__neutral I don't know.
__label__joy This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
__label__neutral That's
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has
__label__neutral But
__label__disgust No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
__label__neutral Okay. Okay, but you cant fire him today.
__label__non-neutral Why not?!
__label__non-neutral Because Im dumping him today.
__label__surprise What?! You said he was sweet!
__label__neutral He
__label__neutral Just dont pick up your phone.
__label__disgust Then he comes over!  "Im so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
__label__surprise What? So now Im not allowed to fire him?
__label__non-neutral You cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill himself.
__label__neutral Okay well then, Ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
__label__disgust Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill
__label__neutral Okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it!
__label__non-neutral Okay. But the question is whos gonna go first. Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
__label__non-neutral Really? Thats the thing Im worse at! Youll see.
__label__neutral This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
__label__sadness Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
__label__sadness Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone?
__label__neutral Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
__label__neutral Oh. Well, Ill right you everyday.  15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
__label__sadness Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
__label__neutral Chandler?
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__non-neutral Chandler!
__label__non-neutral Janice!
__label__surprise There you are!
__label__surprise There you are!
__label__non-neutral I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
__label__neutral No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
__label__joy Well, I then guess Im going to Yemen! Im going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral HeyOoh, hows Hilda? Is she working out?
__label__neutral Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
__label__neutral Was she happy you gave her the job?
__label__neutral Oh, my-my new assistant was very happy that I hired my new assistant.
__label__neutral Hello?
__label__surprise Oh hey!
__label__neutral Can you, can you hang on a second?
__label__neutral Its the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
__label__neutral can you excuse me for a minute?
__label__non-neutral Hey, funny you should call.
__label__neutral I was just looking over next weeks script.
__label__surprise Canceled?!
__label__surprise Like theyre taking it off the air?
__label__neutral Ohh.
__label__neutral All right, see you Monday.
__label__surprise Were not even shootin them anymore?!!
__label__non-neutral All right, bye!
__label__non-neutral They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
__label__sadness Sorry.
__label__sadness Im sorry Joey.
__label__surprise Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
__label__neutral Its so secluded up here.
__label__joy I know. I like it up here.
__label__non-neutral I feel like were the only two people in the world.  Oops. Sorry.
__label__non-neutral Whats the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
__label__fear No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-Iwould youactually, would you go check on that?
__label__neutral Honey, we dont have any bears here.
__label__neutral Well, okay. Would-would you get me a
__label__neutral Okay. Ill be right back.
__label__surprise Okay.  What?! What are you doing here?!
__label__neutral What are
__label__non-neutral I came with Paul!
__label__neutral Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
__label__anger Get up!
__label__joy Here you go honey!
__label__joy Ahh. Thank you!
__label__neutral Diet Coke
__label__non-neutral What the hell was that?!
__label__neutral A lesson in the importance of unagi.
__label__neutral Ohh,
__label__neutral Perhaps. Now Im curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to
__label__neutral All right, so we werent
__label__neutral Im sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but Ilook, I just want you guys to be safe.
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral Im leaning. This is where I lean.
__label__neutral Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
__label__fear Brenda a bee!
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
__label__disgust I think I know whats going on here.
__label__neutral You do?
__label__disgust Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its wrong. Youre married.
__label__neutral I totally understand.  Can I
__label__joy All right, let's do it!
__label__surprise No, no, no. What was that?
__label__neutral I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
__label__non-neutral Well, people!
__label__neutral People, people, people.
__label__neutral Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey.
__label__neutral Show 'em how it's done.
__label__neutral Count it off.
__label__neutral So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
__label__disgust Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and hes so cheap, hed never fly to London in a million years.
__label__neutral Yeah, invite him?
__label__neutral Hey, did I do these neat enough?
__label__neutral Yeah, theyre fine.
__label__non-neutral Yeah?
__label__surprise If anyone asks, well just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
__label__neutral Sure. Why not?
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__non-neutral I dont think Id be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
__label__fear Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldnt invite her?
__label__non-neutral Oh, no-no, yknow I absolutely adore Rachel its just that, well it might be a awkward for you.
__label__neutral But its absolutely your decision.
__label__neutral More tea?
__label__neutral Yeah sure.
__label__neutral Earl Grey?
__label__non-neutral Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hey! So how was the doctor?
__label__joy Oh, everything went great.
__label__neutral Good.
__label__neutral Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
__label__non-neutral Oh.
__label__neutral I dont see the baby. Where is it?
__label__non-neutral Oh no, I know I couldnt see it either at first, but its right umm  Ross, I lost it again.
__label__non-neutral Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
__label__neutral Excuse me?
__label__neutral Could you help me with something?
__label__neutral The patient Im looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.
__label__neutral And umm, hes like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
__label__neutral I think I know who youre talking about.
__label__joy Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
__label__neutral Im sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff
__label__neutral Uh, shes with me.  Dr. Drake Remoray.
__label__neutral Dr. Drake who?
__label__neutral Remoray. Its Portuguese. We need that information; Im a doctor.
__label__surprise A doctor at this hospital?
__label__anger Damnit woman were losing precious time! Now do you want this mans blood on your head?
__label__neutral Hands.
__label__neutral Hands!
__label__neutral It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in.
__label__neutral Hes a patient of mine, Ive been treating him for years!
__label__neutral Hes in room 816.
__label__joy 816, thank you!
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral And what is his name?
__label__surprise No!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
__label__non-neutral Awww.
__label__joy Thanks a million.
__label__joy Oh, youre welcome a million.
__label__neutral Okay, Ill see you in our room.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__neutral Okay, I gotta go.
__label__surprise Whoa! What?! Why?!
__label__sadness Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
__label__surprise Here?! Now?!
__label__neutral Well, yeah.
__label__fear I cant-I cant stay here all night, and if I go in there shes-shes gonna wanna... do stuff.
__label__surprise What happened?
__label__sadness Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago.
__label__joy Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
__label__anger Stupid, useless Canadian money!
__label__neutral Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Will you call him?
__label__joy Yes!
__label__joy I will!
__label__joy Absolutely!
__label__neutral (She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other.
__label__neutral She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in
__label__joy Oh my God! That is so good!
__label__neutral Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral What do you got there?
__label__neutral Oh its umm, its tofu cake. Do you want some?
__label__neutral What are you doing tonight?
__label__neutral Huh? Uh
__label__surprise Dude! Dude!
__label__neutral Oh!  Sorry. Uh, Ive got those plans with Phoebe, why?
__label__surprise Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
__label__surprise What?! Tonight?!
__label__neutral Thats what Monica said.
__label__surprise After she gave me that big speech?!
__label__anger She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?
__label__anger I think shes trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
__label__neutral Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
__label__disgust Who cares? I repel women.
__label__surprise No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Its yours!
__label__non-neutral Yeah well, Im-Im a slut.
__label__neutral Me too.
__label__joy Hi Jill!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hi .
__label__neutral Rachel.
__label__surprise Rachel! Well, you-youre not at home, youre-youre-youre right here.
__label__non-neutral Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But its not!
__label__neutral Okay. So well Ill umm,  Ill have her home by midnight.
__label__non-neutral That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
__label__sadness I'm sorry, man.
__label__neutral Hey, y'know what you should do?
__label__neutral You should make something happen for yourself.
__label__neutral Y'know, like-like write a play.
__label__joy Write a movie!
__label__neutral Huh?
__label__neutral I mean, what about those
__label__sadness Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
__label__joy Wait a second, I could star in it!
__label__neutral Or that.
__label__non-neutral I can't write!
__label__sadness Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?
__label__sadness I can't do it.
__label__neutral I'll help you.
__label__neutral Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.
__label__neutral And plus, it'll give me something to do.
__label__neutral Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
__label__neutral Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope thats cool.
__label__neutral Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.
__label__neutral Although, I should probably tell you, shes a porn star.
__label__neutral Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__non-neutral As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
__label__neutral Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt have to apologize.
__label__neutral I would really love it if I could do both.
__label__non-neutral All right, II have to ask.
__label__neutral What?
__label__fear Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
__label__surprise What?!
__label__anger Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
__label__disgust A hundred and forty-five pounds.
__label__non-neutral Yes, yes it is. Its uh  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
__label__non-neutral Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me?
__label__anger Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didnt bring you here so you can ambush her.
__label__neutral Frannie was the one who found your
__label__anger That bitch!
__label__surprise Monica! What
__label__anger Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
__label__neutral Hi Frannie, congratulations.
__label__anger You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!
__label__surprise Why?!
__label__non-neutral WhatWhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding?
__label__non-neutral What could I have possibly done?!
__label__anger Stuart!
__label__neutral I believe you know my husband.
__label__neutral So its really a question of
__label__non-neutral Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
__label__surprise Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
__label__neutral Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
__label__surprise Yeah?
__label__neutral It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
__label__neutral What's up?
__label__neutral Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk.
__label__neutral Man to uh, me.
__label__neutral Sure. Okay.
__label__surprise Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
__label__neutral Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
__label__neutral You mean scared.
__label__neutral No, I mean happy.
__label__joy Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
__label__sadness Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in.
__label__surprise What do you mean, theyre not moving in? They-theyre still moving in right?
__label__neutral No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
__label__surprise What?! Over a stupid room!
__label__joy Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but Im also really psyched cause I dont have to move in here!
__label__joy Oh no, yeah no, that parts great!
__label__neutral Yes
__label__surprise Shut-out!!
__label__surprise Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
__label__non-neutral Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
__label__anger Yeah, get out!
__label__anger You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!
__label__anger Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?
__label__anger Come on, wussies!
__label__neutral All right, ok, I gotta go.
__label__neutral I'm going,  and I'm gone.
__label__neutral One more game?
__label__joy Oh yeah!
__label__sadness Im sorry.
__label__sadness Ohhh. Dont go.
__label__non-neutral No, I-I-I gotta go.
__label__non-neutral No. No! No! No!
__label__non-neutral Honey, honey, people are looking.
__label__anger I dont care!  I dont care!!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, um, Im, Im leaving now.
__label__non-neutral You cant leave! I have your shoe!
__label__non-neutral Good-bye Chandler Bing.
__label__neutral Rachel has those in burgendy.
__label__disgust Oh, ew!
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you.
__label__neutral Um, can you roll your tongue?
__label__neutral Because I can, and my Mom couldnt, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
__label__neutral What, wait, you mean like this?
__label__surprise Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
__label__neutral Your not doing it.
__label__neutral Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I cant. We dont have that....
__label__neutral Where there is no fear of commitment.
__label__neutral Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
__label__neutral Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.
__label__neutral But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.
__label__fear It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!
__label__neutral If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.
__label__neutral Right.
__label__neutral In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
__label__non-neutral Amazingly, that makes sense.
__label__neutral You think?
__label__joy Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
__label__fear Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
__label__joy Hey!  Hey!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
__label__joy Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
__label__neutral Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
__label__neutral Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
__label__surprise Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!
__label__non-neutral Im missin picture time?!
__label__anger Yknow she has a face Ross!
__label__non-neutral Okay. Okay, heres a good one of us.
__label__joy Wow!
__label__joy That is a good one!
__label__joy Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card yknow, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
__label__neutral Yknow, every year I say Im gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it.
__label__neutral Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?
__label__surprise Together? Like-like to people?
__label__joy Yeah, yknow. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. Itll be cute, okay?
__label__non-neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?
__label__neutral Uh sure, sure.
__label__neutral Bye guys.
__label__non-neutral I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
__label__non-neutral You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve got a girlfriend?
__label__neutral Is this about Mark?
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral Okay, its not, its not.
__label__non-neutral Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
__label__neutral Fine, youre right.
__label__neutral Lets ah, lets take a break,  lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
__label__non-neutral No. A break from us.
__label__non-neutral Bing! Were all set for tonight, 8 oclock.
__label__non-neutral Oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. Monica has to work.
__label__non-neutral Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
__label__neutral Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.
__label__non-neutral Oh? Why not?
__label__neutral Its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament.
__label__non-neutral Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
__label__non-neutral Well now-now youre just talking crazy.
__label__neutral So why cant the three of us go out together?
__label__sadness Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
__label__non-neutral Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.
__label__joy And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
__label__anger Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
__label__neutral Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this.
__label__joy Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club.
__label__anger Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.
__label__neutral Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.
__label__neutral It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.
__label__anger : Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!
__label__neutral It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy.
__label__neutral Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.
__label__neutral There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.
__label__neutral Did he call?
__label__sadness No. Sorry.
__label__non-neutral Why?! Why?! He said hed call. Why hasnt he called?
__label__neutral Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
__label__non-neutral Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasnt he called, Rachel? Why?
__label__neutral Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
__label__surprise Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
__label__neutral Well...
__label__non-neutral The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you?
__label__neutral No. I...
__label__anger Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
__label__non-neutral And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?
__label__non-neutral I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion!
__label__anger Is that too much to ask after six years?!
__label__non-neutral I mean what?
__label__non-neutral Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!
__label__non-neutral I mean do we not have as much fun?!
__label__non-neutral Dont I deserve a few tears?!!
__label__non-neutral I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__anger I did not cry my eyes out!!
__label__non-neutral Come on!
__label__sadness Its like the end of an era!
__label__sadness No more J-man and Channies!
__label__non-neutral !
__label__non-neutral Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
__label__neutral Do I know why were rushing?
__label__neutral Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
__label__neutral Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.
__label__joy Oh, I found it!
__label__surprise !
__label__joy Thats so great for you guys!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Good luck, with your girlfriend.
__label__joy Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!
__label__neutral Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
__label__neutral Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
__label__neutral So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
__label__joy Yes, you can, very much.
__label__surprise Ahhhh!!
__label__non-neutral Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
__label__neutral Do
__label__neutral Ah,
__label__neutral Do
__label__neutral Ah,
__label__non-neutral DO YOU?
__label__non-neutral Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was a beautiful speech.
__label__disgust Oh, come on.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__joy All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!
__label__neutral And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.
__label__neutral And what you said about Nana.
__label__non-neutral Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there.
__label__neutral And you know what?
__label__neutral I think she was.
__label__surprise Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
__label__neutral You forget how many great songs Heart had.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
__label__non-neutral So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
__label__neutral Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but Im not even sure I got it.
__label__neutral What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey.
__label__neutral And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.
__label__non-neutral You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
__label__neutral Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
__label__anger I cant find garbage bags!
__label__neutral Oh, I think I saw some in here.
__label__surprise What is it?!
__label__disgust I dont know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itll die.
__label__non-neutral I cant believe were living here!
__label__surprise You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really  proposing?
__label__non-neutral No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.
__label__surprise Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it  look like?!
__label__non-neutral I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of  it.
__label__non-neutral Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
__label__sadness Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don't want to hurt her.
__label__neutral Okay, look, just do it gently.
__label__neutral You're right.
__label__neutral You're right.
__label__neutral I-I'll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I'll be gentle.
__label__neutral I can do that.
__label__neutral I am a gentle person.
__label__neutral Oh, by the  way.
__label__neutral Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.
__label__neutral Hi, Pheebs?
__label__neutral Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
__label__non-neutral What?!
__label__non-neutral Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England.
__label__neutral Which
__label__neutral How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
__label__neutral Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
__label__neutral Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
__label__joy Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which
__label__joy Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here
__label__anger You completely stole my answer!
__label__non-neutral Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
__label__anger Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
__label__neutral What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
__label__neutral I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
__label__neutral Would ya care to venture one?
__label__neutral Would
__label__anger Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
__label__neutral Are you just repeating what
__label__neutral All right, let's move on.
__label__neutral Okay then.
__label__neutral All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.
__label__neutral And-and when she comes in hopefully, she wont recognise you because, well, why would she?
__label__neutral Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.
__label__neutral You be Mr. Gonzalez, and Ill be uh, Mr. Wong.
__label__neutral Diverse.
__label__neutral Did anybody call for security?
__label__neutral You be cool.
__label__neutral Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk?  Hey, Joey?
__label__fear Wheres my ring? My dead grandmothers wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
__label__neutral Way to be cool, man.
__label__neutral Whats he talking about?
__label__non-neutral There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
__label__surprise Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
__label__anger We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
__label__surprise Okay, who are you?
__label__non-neutral The Hardy boys?
__label__anger Look, I dont need to steal some stupid ring, all right?
__label__anger I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
__label__neutral Marry me.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Joey!
__label__joy Hell yeah! Ill marry you!
__label__anger You cant marry him!
__label__non-neutral Hey lady, your days over! Its my turn!
__label__surprise Phoebe!
__label__surprise Why?! Why cant she marry me?!
__label__non-neutral I can and I will!
__label__neutral Shes not pregnant. Its Rachel. Rachels the one whos pregnant.
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral Phoebe I think he would notice if you didnt have a baby in nine months!
__label__surprise Its Joey!
__label__surprise Now I cant believe it! What? Rachels pregnant?  Whos the father?
__label__neutral We dont know.
__label__neutral Ohh I wonder if that dude.
__label__surprise Theres a dude?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__surprise Who? Who is it?
__label__disgust About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didnt see who it was but
__label__neutral Was that story over?
__label__neutral The guy left this.
__label__surprise Oh my God! I know who the father is
__label__non-neutral People have got to finish their stories!
__label__surprise Oh my God, youre back!
__label__surprise Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
__label__neutral Why do you want to see my hand?
__label__disgust I wanna see whats in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__disgust Eww! Oh, its all dirty. You should throw this out.
__label__anger No!
__label__non-neutral Me too!
__label__neutral Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, yknow?
__label__non-neutral Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we dont wanna look stupid!
__label__joy Alright were back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
__label__neutral Three, Two, One!
__label__neutral Cut!
__label__joy No! Year! Happy No Year!
__label__joy Okay, heres where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone thats a wrap!
__label__neutral So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
__label__neutral Oh no-no believe me, Im leaving as soon as possible!
__label__neutral Good. Good. Not that we dont want you to stay, obviously youre welcomeHow much more homework do you have?
__label__neutral I see. Yknow umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
__label__surprise No!
__label__neutral No, she doesnt.
__label__neutral Uh Phoebe, what she makesthats uhtheyre sock rabbits.
__label__anger They are completely differentOkay!
__label__surprise Okay!
__label__surprise Okay!
__label__non-neutral I didnt make it!
__label__sadness Im sorry!
__label__neutral I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that were supposed to
__label__neutral Oh, its okay. I dont
__label__non-neutral No-no, its not okay!
__label__non-neutral Its not!
__label__non-neutral I mean you were just Youre so incredible!
__label__non-neutral You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me!
__label__joy Yknow Im just gonnaI, I am gonna make this up to you!
__label__non-neutral I will!
__label__neutral I-I am going to
__label__neutral Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
__label__neutral No.  And then I called him, and he wasnt there.
__label__neutral Well, then hes, hes probably just, out.
__label__non-neutral Oh, thank you thats very helpful, Im glad you came over.
__label__neutral Hello.
__label__non-neutral Hi! Its me.
__label__joy Hi! Oh, Im so glad you called.
__label__non-neutral Really? Ive been thinking, this is crazy, I mean dont, dont you think we can work on this?
__label__neutral Hey, what do you want to drink?
__label__surprise Whos that?
__label__neutral Nobody.
__label__neutral Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
__label__neutral Is that Mark?
__label__neutral Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
__label__non-neutral Yeah! Got it!
__label__non-neutral Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
__label__non-neutral Ah, thats okay, thanks.
__label__neutral Hey, you dont have to smile. You just have to dance.
__label__non-neutral Look, I dont feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
__label__neutral Oh, okay.  Hey, two beers.
__label__neutral You wanna go in the bedroom? Its a little more comfortable.
__label__neutral Sure.
__label__surprise Okay.  Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
__label__surprise If this is your idea of sexy talk?
__label__non-neutral No seriously, yknow the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
__label__neutral What contracts?
__label__non-neutral Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I dont get.
__label__neutral Like what?
__label__disgust Yknow, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?
__label__anger Tag!
__label__anger Im serious!
__label__anger This isnt funny!
__label__anger Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
__label__surprise Rach, Im sorry, but you didnt give me any contracts!
__label__anger Yes I did! And I put a little
__label__neutral Im telling you, you never gave them to me.
__label__anger Yknow what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
__label__non-neutral No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are
__label__disgust Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
__label__neutral You wanna go down to the office right now?
__label__anger No! Come on its late, were not gonna go down to the office.
__label__neutral Okay I understand.  I wouldnt want to be proved wrong either.
__label__joy Okay get your coat!  Oh! When did you unhook this?  Nice work!
__label__neutral Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this    is my good friend Ross.
__label__neutral Nice to meet you.
__label__neutral Oh and I need to talk to you.
__label__neutral About what?
__label__neutral To see if know what these guys are talking about.
__label__neutral Pheebs, hows it going?
__label__neutral Im doing okay. I think its going well. Do you think theyre having fun? Am I talking to fast?
__label__joy Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, its going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
__label__neutral Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before?
__label__neutral Oh right, Coach Ruben.
__label__neutral Do you know what Pheebs?
__label__fear When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
__label__neutral Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
__label__neutral See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
__label__surprise What do you mean?
__label__anger Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
__label__anger Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
__label__surprise Uh, what was that?
__label__neutral Uh,

__label__neutral That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Bye.
__label__joy Whoo-hoo!
__label__joy Yeah, there you go!
__label__joy Second date!
__label__neutral ...I dunno.
__label__neutral You
__label__non-neutral Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay?
__label__disgust I mean,... how needy is that?
__label__neutral Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
__label__joy You're so pretty.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Hey, Phoebe.
__label__neutral Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
__label__surprise You talked to him. Are you crazy?
__label__joy Thank you, Happy Holidays.
__label__anger Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't  Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
__label__non-neutral Hey!!
__label__fear The charity's on fire!
__label__fear Help!
__label__joy Oh good!

__label__surprise Whoa!
__label__surprise What is that?!
__label__surprise It's nine o'clock in the morning!
__label__neutral Can I help you?
__label__neutral Uh yeah, where-wheres the guy who decides whos pictures go up on the wall?
__label__neutral Hes not here right now.
__label__anger Oh, youre kidding me!
__label__neutral All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral Im an actor; Im kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
__label__neutral Yknow, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
__label__neutral Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  Youre the other one right?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
__label__surprise What?! Youre crazy! Theres nothing sexual about the noises I make!
__label__surprise Really?
__label__non-neutral Theres nothing sexual about this?
__label__non-neutral Oooh.
__label__non-neutral Oo God!
__label__non-neutral Ohh.
__label__non-neutral Ohhhh.
__label__non-neutral Ohh.
__label__non-neutral What are you looking at?!
__label__neutral I mean hi.
__label__non-neutral Oh myThis is so embarrassing. Oh my God, Im never gonna get massaged again!
__label__non-neutral No, you cant let this stop you from getting massages!
__label__neutral No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Well not clients, lovers. But lets just yknow, try it again. Come back and-and well work through it.
__label__surprise Are you sure?
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__neutral I guess.
__label__joy Great! Okay, if youll just excuse me.  So, did you hear something you liked?
__label__non-neutral Noo!!!
__label__non-neutral Yes!
__label__non-neutral Noo!!
__label__non-neutral Yes!!
__label__fear Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk!  That they know of.
__label__neutral Okay, heres the thing. Were gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that youre drunk.
__label__non-neutral Really?! You promise?
__label__neutral Yeah, Ill take care of it.
__label__joy Okay. I love you so much.
__label__neutral Okay we have to do something about your breath.
__label__surprise What about
__label__neutral Thats still yours. Okay, now remember its a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
__label__neutral Okay. I can do that.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__surprise Surprise!!!
__label__neutral Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.
__label__neutral Yeah, were done.
__label__surprise Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
__label__joy Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
__label__joy Sweet!
__label__neutral All right, well finish your coffee; lets go.
__label__disgust Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
__label__neutral Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight.
__label__non-neutral I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
__label__sadness Im sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby
__label__neutral So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
__label__non-neutral Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.
__label__neutral Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
__label__joy She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
__label__joy Oh, what a fun office.
__label__neutral I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.
__label__neutral So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
__label__neutral Rachel? Do you smoke?
__label__neutral Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror storiesabout ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral Peach pit.
__label__neutral Yes, Bunny?
__label__neutral Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
__label__neutral -Peaches?
__label__neutral Actually, nectarines, but basically...
__label__neutral Could've been a peach.
__label__neutral Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.
__label__non-neutral Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!  What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
__label__joy All right!
__label__joy Westminster Abbey!
__label__joy Hands down, best Abbey Ive ever seen.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
__label__neutral I think its great. Its great. Yknow, theyre thinking of changing the name of this place.
__label__surprise Really? To what?
__label__non-neutral To Put the Camera Away!!!
__label__neutral Man,
__label__surprise Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And
__label__neutral Chandler, theres a guy right over there.
__label__surprise Thats a mailman! Thats
__label__neutral Chandler, dont worry! This doesnt make you any less of a guy!
__label__neutral Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
__label__neutral Hmm.
__label__non-neutral Eh..., I dont, I dont know.
__label__neutral What?
__label__non-neutral Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
__label__neutral Rachel?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
__label__non-neutral Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
__label__neutral Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
__label__non-neutral Eh, do you believe that?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__non-neutral Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
__label__neutral No, you said the baby creeps you out.
__label__non-neutral No, the little girl creeps me out.
__label__neutral You said the baby.
__label__non-neutral Why would the baby creep me out?
__label__non-neutral Why would the little girl creep you out?
__label__neutral You guys, Im sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
__label__surprise This is going in your book?
__label__joy Yeah, its about relationships. Yknow? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
__label__surprise What?! Excuse me!
__label__neutral And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.
__label__neutral And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as its a compliment.
__label__joy Yeah!!!!
__label__joy Yes, I made it!
__label__joy Im on time!
__label__neutral Okay, why dont we all uh,  open our books to page 23.
__label__neutral Where  Where you will seea uha bunch of uhred spots.
__label__neutral Okay,  umm, why dont, why dont you all start to read, while I
__label__non-neutral Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
__label__non-neutral Ross! What are you I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
__label__neutral Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
__label__surprise What the? What
__label__non-neutral Hi!
__label__neutral Miss? May I help you?
__label__non-neutral Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay?
__label__neutral But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.
__label__sadness So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
__label__neutral It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
__label__neutral Do you want me to be afraid of you?
__label__neutral Of course not.
__label__joy I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.
__label__non-neutral I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Of course!
__label__non-neutral Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
__label__neutral All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit
__label__anger Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is
__label__disgust A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
__label__non-neutral Ooh, it's not a toy.
__label__sadness Well, I don't know what else to do.
__label__non-neutral I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!
__label__non-neutral So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!
__label__non-neutral 'Cause I-I got nothing!
__label__non-neutral All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.
__label__neutral Okay then.
__label__neutral Here we go.
__label__non-neutral Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?
__label__neutral Ask again later.
__label__anger Later is not good enough.
__label__neutral Ask again later.
__label__anger What the hell!
__label__anger This is broken!
__label__anger It-it is broken!
__label__neutral All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
__label__neutral Excuse me.
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Are you Phoebe Buffay?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy Can-can I get your autograph, Im your biggest fan.
__label__neutral I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
__label__joy Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
__label__non-neutral No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
__label__neutral Come on, two on one.
__label__surprise What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
__label__surprise What, now?
__label__joy Yes, now is when you swoop!
__label__joy You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not!
__label__non-neutral You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
__label__neutral My Catholic friend is right.
__label__neutral She's distraught.
__label__neutral You're there for her.
__label__joy You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
__label__neutral Well, I just called Joshua
__label__non-neutral Oh, how did it go?
__label__neutral Well, I did my best to convince him that Im not some crazy girl who is dying to get marriedIm just going through a hard time.
__label__neutral What did he say?
__label__non-neutral Well uh, his answering machine was
__label__non-neutral Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that hes gonna call you again.
__label__sadness Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care.
__label__sadness I dont think hes the one Im sad about.
__label__sadness Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well.
__label__sadness Yeah, maybe.
__label__sadness And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
__label__non-neutral Any luck?
__label__sadness Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?
__label__sadness I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
__label__non-neutral Again. Yknow what? I think we all did.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__surprise I dont get it!
__label__non-neutral It was in my room all night!
__label__non-neutral And if she didnt take it, and I didnt take it; and you  didnt take it, then who did?
__label__anger Shh!
__label__anger Were trying to think!
__label__neutral This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__joy Oh yeah!
__label__neutral I got in there myself once.
__label__neutral My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldnt, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral It was funny til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
__label__neutral No, you, you cant fit in that thing. Thats not deep enough.
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah?  If I cant, Ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
__label__neutral All right, you have yourself a deal.
__label__surprise Okay.  See?! I told ya!
__label__non-neutral Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
__label__neutral Hey! Whats up?
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__joy Hey-hey, whos your friend?  Hey!!
__label__joy Hey Joey!
__label__joy Erin! Still here!
__label__joy Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
__label__joy Why wouldnt ya? Erin is great! Then-then theres you guys.
__label__joy Ohh, listen. Ive got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
__label__non-neutral I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
__label__neutral Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__surprise Ohh!
__label__neutral Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral I mean you definitely should do that.
__label__joy Y'know what, I should do it.
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
__label__neutral Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__non-neutral Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
__label__anger This woman's living my life.
__label__surprise What?
__label__anger She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!
__label__non-neutral Look at this, look.
__label__non-neutral She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.
__label__non-neutral She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.
__label__non-neutral She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
__label__neutral You're not an artist.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
__label__surprise I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
__label__non-neutral No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
__label__neutral I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
__label__non-neutral Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
__label__surprise I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
__label__disgust Oh, that is so sick.
__label__disgust I feel violated. And not in a good way.
__label__surprise How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
__label__joy Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
__label__non-neutral I know. My arm is killing me.
__label__neutral No, I meant with the dropper over here.
__label__anger Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm
__label__neutral Hey Rach, can you pass me the
__label__neutral Yep!
__label__joy Go!!
__label__surprise What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral Okay! Okay! Okay!  We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
__label__joy Oh, thanks, thanks.
__label__neutral So Monica tells me that uh, you dont want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent.
__label__neutral Is that true?
__label__neutral Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
__label__neutral Pheebs
__label__non-neutral Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
__label__non-neutral What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here.
__label__neutral Whats the matter?
__label__neutral Nothing.
__label__non-neutral What is it? Hey!
__label__sadness Really its nothing. Im just
__label__neutral Rach come on, what?
__label__sadness Ive just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
__label__surprise What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
__label__sadness Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
__label__neutral Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
__label__sadness Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right?
__label__neutral Yeah, I guess so.
__label__sadness I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
__label__surprise Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?!
__label__joy I just found out this is Chandlers office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!
__label__non-neutral Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
__label__anger We said seven!
__label__anger We said six!
__label__neutral The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.
__label__anger Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!"
__label__joy Hi!
__label__disgust Oh my good God.
__label__disgust Ugh!
__label__non-neutral I know what time you said.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
__label__anger You, get out of my shop!
__label__surprise Well, what did he do?
__label__anger He went out with my wife!
__label__surprise Joey!
__label__non-neutral Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-IHey! I did
__label__anger Thats my wife!!! Get out!
__label__neutral Well, we should go.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport.
__label__neutral Oh please.
__label__non-neutral Every moment is precious.
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__non-neutral Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.
__label__neutral Well, were really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
__label__non-neutral On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane.
__label__non-neutral No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.
__label__neutral Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
__label__neutral Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
__label__neutral So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.
__label__neutral We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
__label__joy Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.
__label__surprise Yeah?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Just go for it Chandler.
__label__neutral Yeah, you should.
__label__neutral Yeah, you should, really.
__label__neutral Go on.
__label__neutral All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. But Im just doing it for you guys.
__label__non-neutral : Im sure as hell a dancer, its no use Marge will never go for me.
__label__non-neutral Come on Treeger, dont say that.
__label__neutral You just ahh, you just need more practice.
__label__neutral Here, come on, lets ahh, lets try it again.
__label__neutral Come on.
__label__non-neutral Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.
__label__non-neutral I mean, yknow, Im not really that comfortable dancing with a We-he!!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral : Yeah!
__label__neutral Oh, I
__label__neutral Are you sure? Ill bet theres another flight to Minsk in like
__label__neutral July. Umm,
__label__non-neutral Thats really beautiful. What does it mean?
__label__neutral Please, clean my beakers. I dont get out of the lab much.
__label__non-neutral Thats good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
__label__neutral Yeah, I Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldnt because yknow, Ihave to leave.
__label__non-neutral Youre right! Youre right. Dont say it.
__label__non-neutral I-I do though.
__label__non-neutral I do too.
__label__neutral Bye Phoebe.
__label__non-neutral Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__surprise Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that?
__label__non-neutral Listen, Im gettin something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
__label__neutral No, I do not hear that.
__label__joy Yeah, I-I heard.  I think its great!  Ohh, Im so happy for you!
__label__joy Oh, well, thats great!
__label__joy Yeah! Yeah!
__label__joy I cant believe youre getting married!
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Monica and Rachel made out.
__label__surprise Ohhh!
__label__surprise Why are we in bed together?
__label__neutral I dont know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral No!
__label__fear But we-we didnt havesex-uh, did we?
__label__neutral I mean, I dont remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
__label__joy Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
__label__neutral And we didnt have sex.
__label__neutral Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. Im just glad we didnt do anything stupid.
__label__neutral Tell me about it.
__label__neutral What are we gonna do?
__label__neutral I say we go with
__label__neutral Chandler?
__label__neutral Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
__label__non-neutral Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
__label__disgust Whats that smell?
__label__non-neutral I know!
__label__neutral Hi, remember us?
__label__neutral Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a
__label__neutral I am. I'm
__label__neutral Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
__label__sadness Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
__label__neutral Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
__label__neutral Yknow what? It
__label__neutral Sorry.
__label__joy Im so exited!
__label__joy Ive been waiting for this for months!
__label__joy I got my hair coloured!
__label__joy I got new sheets!
__label__joy Im making him a
__label__neutral Um-hmm.
__label__neutral What am I making him by the way?
__label__neutral Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
__label__surprise I thought I was making him filet mignon?
__label__neutral Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.
__label__non-neutral And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
__label__surprise Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
__label__non-neutral Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!
__label__non-neutral Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated.
__label__neutral Yknow its like uh, Biology!
__label__non-neutral Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
__label__neutral Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.
__label__non-neutral Phoebe!
__label__neutral If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes probably not gay.
__label__neutral You are falling fast asleep.
__label__neutral Deeper.
__label__neutral Deeper.
__label__neutral Deeper.
__label__neutral You are now completely asleep.
__label__neutral You dont need to smoke.
__label__neutral Cigarettes dont control you.
__label__neutral You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
__label__neutral A strong, confident woman.
__label__neutral Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller.
__label__joy Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
__label__neutral Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
__label__non-neutral Of course not.
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
__label__neutral So how are things going with Paul?
__label__joy Good.
__label__non-neutral Although yknow, he-hes a private guy.
__label__sadness Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
__label__neutral Thats easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wont open.
__label__surprise So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
__label__neutral No thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
__label__neutral Hi honey.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__fear Okay, Ben, I wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident.
__label__surprise Monica, number one, I dont think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!
__label__neutral You said number two.
__label__neutral I also said number one.
__label__neutral Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
__label__neutral Cant I just look at the handles on them?
__label__neutral You would think.
__label__neutral Okay, fine.
__label__non-neutral Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why Im a terrible waitress?
__label__neutral Because, I dont care.
__label__neutral I dont care.
__label__non-neutral I dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I dont care where the tray spot is, I just dont care, this is not what I want to do.
__label__non-neutral So I dont think I should do it anymore.
__label__non-neutral Im gonna give you my weeks notice.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral Gunther, I quit.
__label__surprise Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee?
__label__non-neutral Ohh, I mean its just so realistic!
__label__neutral I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.
__label__joy Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
__label__neutral Do you uh, do youready for a refill?
__label__surprise Oh, I probably shouldntso I will!  Oh! Wow! Its like its raining!
__label__joy Pretty cool, huh?
__label__neutral But if youre thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldnt get sucked up into the mechanism, well youd be wrong.
__label__neutral Umm, can I use your bathroom?
__label__neutral Its uh, right through there.
__label__non-neutral Okay.  God yknow, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbianis apartment
__label__joy Yeah, lifes pretty great isnt it?
__label__joy Yeah, it sure is!
__label__neutral You know, I think I was sixteen.
__label__neutral Please, just a little bit off the back.
__label__neutral I'm still on "no."
__label__neutral Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
__label__anger No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.
__label__neutral What's goin' on?
__label__neutral Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
__label__non-neutral What stupid thing did you do?
__label__disgust Ewww!
__label__neutral I know.
__label__neutral See, yes.
__label__neutral Thats Yasmine Bleeth, shes a completely different kind of chick.
__label__neutral I love you both.
__label__neutral But in very different ways.
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__neutral (sees hes watching
__label__non-neutral I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
__label__non-neutral If they cant find a home for her, they kill her! And Im not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
__label__non-neutral Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
__label__disgust Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of other animals!
__label__disgust Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
__label__joy Thanks, Im glad you see it that way.
__label__joy Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
__label__neutral So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
__label__non-neutral Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
__label__neutral So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
__label__neutral Ohh, he's really shy. I-I dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
__label__neutral Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
__label__non-neutral I dont care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
__label__surprise Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?
__label__neutral I might've said that.  Why is that funny?
__label__joy Because I'm very happy for him!  And
__label__non-neutral Hi!
__label__neutral All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral All right, let's go say good-bye.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__anger Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?
__label__disgust Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
__label__surprise Fish!
__label__neutral It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
__label__sadness Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here
__label__joy Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
__label__joy We did have fun, didn't we?
__label__joy We did!
__label__neutral Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
__label__joy Oh, I would love to!
__label__joy Yay, okay!
__label__joy Good, good, good, good, good.
__label__neutral Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
__label__neutral Um...  Done!
__label__surprise Youre, hey, youre not paying for the pizza!
__label__neutral Oh come on, its only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
__label__neutral Ahh, Id throw another thousand on that.
__label__neutral Why, how much is that?
__label__neutral Thats about 60 cents.
__label__neutral Okay, its coffee.
__label__surprise Ice coffee? Tell me its ice coffee!
__label__neutral Its-its hot
__label__surprise Hot coffee!!!
__label__anger You idiot!!
__label__anger You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!
__label__anger What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?!
__label__non-neutral Huh?
__label__anger !
__label__neutral Whats your favourite thing about summertime?
__label__neutral Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
__label__neutral Yeah
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__joy Tommyyyy! Say, whats your favourite thing about summer?
__label__neutral Ooh, I dont know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
__label__non-neutral Ohh, thats a good one.
__label__neutral OK, try this salmon mousse.
__label__joy Mmmm. Good.
__label__neutral Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
__label__non-neutral It's creamier.
__label__neutral Yeah, well, is that
__label__disgust I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
__label__surprise My God! What happened to you?
__label__disgust Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?
__label__non-neutral "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
__label__joy That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
__label__non-neutral Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really
__label__non-neutral Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
__label__joy Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
__label__neutral Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
__label__neutral I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
__label__non-neutral Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
__label__neutral Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
__label__neutral I don't see why not.
__label__neutral Here's my retainer!
__label__neutral Someone in there?
__label__non-neutral No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.
__label__surprise Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
__label__neutral Someone was in the lady's room, I couldnt wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
__label__neutral Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, Im-Im talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name.
__label__neutral Ginger.
__label__neutral Ginger. Im talking to Ginger, so....
__label__neutral Dont you have to use the bathroom?
__label__neutral Nope, nope, Id just ah, Id rather talk to you.
__label__neutral Yes, I do.
__label__neutral Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
__label__neutral Someone in here.
__label__anger Im going to keep dating him Mother, and theres nothing you can do about it!
__label__anger Oh yes there is!
__label__anger What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
__label__anger That was an accident! And so were you.
__label__anger Well, at least Im not a murderer!
__label__non-neutral Oh, my baby!
__label__surprise That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
__label__neutral Oh, just years of experience.
__label__non-neutral Can I get some ice here?!
__label__joy Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
__label__non-neutral Youre not the fan whos dying are you?
__label__surprise Say what?
__label__neutral Im supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying, but thats not supposed to be until  later!
__label__non-neutral No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-Im the guy in the coma!
__label__surprise Oh that was a real person?!
__label__non-neutral An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
__label__surprise I-I-Im leaving the show?
__label__neutral I dont know. Why? Did you hear something?
__label__surprise Who told you that?
__label__non-neutral Oh uh, one of the writers.
__label__surprise Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
__label__neutral Umm
__label__neutral Feel better?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy Much!
__label__non-neutral Listen uh, not that Im yknow insecure about my manhood or anything yknow, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
__label__neutral Yeah, I understand.
__label__joy Yeah! Okay!  Hey! Hi!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__surprise Yknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
__label__neutral I dont think so.
__label__non-neutral Oh! Maybe its because Im on television. Im an actor on
__label__surprise Wow!
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Hm-mmm.
__label__neutral $4.50 please.
__label__neutral Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.
__label__neutral Alright, alright, alright.
__label__non-neutral It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word.
__label__non-neutral Oh God, do something.
__label__non-neutral Just make contact, smile!
__label__joy There you go!
__label__non-neutral You're definitely scaring here.
__label__neutral Would you like to call somebody?
__label__neutral Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.
__label__anger Okay! Feel free to look, but Im telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
__label__neutral Oh
__label__neutral Its my sister.
__label__neutral Okay, very cute braces. Anyway yknow what, the
__label__non-neutral So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
__label__neutral In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a
__label__neutral Phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, she doesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know that youve been living with your Grandmothers for a week now.
__label__neutral Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__sadness Im never gonna find a roommate, ever.
__label__neutral Why, nobody good?
__label__disgust Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural.
__label__disgust The spitter.
__label__non-neutral Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.
__label__neutral Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing
__label__neutral So how many more do you have tomorrow?
__label__neutral Two.
__label__neutral This photographer, who seemed really dull.
__label__neutral And this actor guy, who Im not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone Chandler Bing, he said Whoa-whoa, short message.
__label__neutral Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
__label__non-neutral Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
__label__neutral Umm, hows it going with you guys?
__label__neutral Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
__label__surprise Oh, really?
__label__joy Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesnt really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think its gonna make a difference
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hi!
__label__non-neutral What-what are-what are these?
__label__joy Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought theyd brighten up the place. They do dont you think?
__label__non-neutral No-no-no, no!
__label__neutral Well, how-how come?
__label__neutral Thats just the way it is.
__label__surprise Thats crazy.
__label__neutral Maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.
__label__neutral See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now Peter!
__label__neutral Hey, Peter!
__label__neutral Its me Rhonda!
__label__neutral From PS-129!
__label__non-neutral I shared my puddin which you man!
__label__neutral I gave you my
__label__neutral I-I think everybodys pretending they dont hear you.
__label__neutral Anyway, look, I dont know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, Im telling you, he
__label__neutral Thats okay, Im cool over here. Ill catch up with you later, Joey.
__label__neutral Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.
__label__neutral Hows that coffee comin, dear?
__label__neutral Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
__label__neutral Im not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
__label__non-neutral I know!
__label__surprise Ill bet your thinking, Whats an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee? Eh?
__label__neutral Op.
__label__non-neutral Eh.
__label__neutral Oh, you got me.
__label__neutral Well, dont think I havent noticed your potential.
__label__neutral Well, Ive got a project for you thats a lot more related to fashion.
__label__neutral How does that sound?
__label__joy Oh, that sounds great.
__label__neutral Come on over here, sweetheart.
__label__joy Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
__label__fear Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe youd want to get back together?
__label__neutral No. But thanks.
__label__sadness Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
__label__neutral Okay. No. But thanks.
__label__neutral Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
__label__surprise Wow, that was kinda brutal.
__label__neutral Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.
__label__neutral Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, yknow.
__label__neutral Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,
__label__neutral Yeah, sure.
__label__surprise Wow.
__label__neutral I'm, I'm really sorry.
__label__neutral Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
__label__surprise Relieved?
__label__neutral Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
__label__neutral She wants
__label__anger Oh my God! If you say that one more time,
__label__anger Fine!
__label__anger Fine!
__label__anger But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  If you accept full responsibility...  Full responsibility!
__label__anger ...I can begin to trust you again.
__label__anger Does that seem like something you can do.
__label__anger Does it?!
__label__anger !
__label__surprise No?
__label__neutral Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel.
__label__neutral If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
__label__sadness Yeah, I know.
__label__sadness I mean, no, youre right.
__label__neutral Yeah I guess Ill let it go.
__label__sadness But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
__label__neutral Sure, its hard to forget!
__label__neutral But that doesnt mean you have to talk about it!
__label__neutral A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.
__label__surprise What the hell happened on that beach?!
__label__neutral Its between us and the sea, Ross!
__label__non-neutral I didnt think you were gay. I do now.
__label__neutral See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
__label__sadness Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious.
__label__neutral Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
__label__surprise Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
__label__neutral Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
__label__joy Oh wow! Im free for her!
__label__surprise Oh, wait a second! I didnt say I wasnt free!
__label__neutral Hey, Chandler, why dont we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
__label__neutral Hold on, yknow I
__label__non-neutral Oh well, thats uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
__label__neutral Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
__label__neutral Well, I dont really know what that is, but
__label__neutral Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
__label__neutral Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
__label__disgust Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
__label__surprise What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
__label__neutral What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
__label__anger Joey, get out of the fridge.
__label__non-neutral All right, all right.
__label__surprise What is that?
__label__neutral For the ride.
__label__neutral Yeah, like in a cab...
__label__neutral Save it.
__label__disgust Okay, hating this.
__label__neutral Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
__label__joy I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
__label__disgust That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
__label__non-neutral All right, I'm going. I'm going.
__label__neutral Here we go, here we go.
__label__neutral Rossy, Rossy.
__label__non-neutral WHAT IS IT?!
__label__non-neutral Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
__label__neutral Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
__label__neutral Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
__label__non-neutral Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Calling from Rome!
__label__neutral So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
__label__non-neutral Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome.  I'm talking to Rome.
__label__non-neutral Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
__label__non-neutral So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
__label__non-neutral Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
__label__surprise You know it?
__label__neutral Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
__label__neutral Oh, sure, they love us over there.
__label__joy Ben! Ben! Ben!
__label__anger Gimme em!
__label__anger No! They are mine!
__label__anger You stole them from me!
__label__anger You stole them from me!!
__label__anger Gimme them!
__label__neutral You just wanna each take one?
__label__neutral Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
__label__non-neutral Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
__label__neutral Well
__label__neutral Why dont you phase it out?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think youre, yknow, that youre adjusting to life in America.
__label__neutral Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean theyre probably not even listening!
__label__surprise Theyre not listening too me?
__label__neutral Of course theyre listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
__label__non-neutral Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
__label__neutral I think you look fine.
__label__neutral How about Joey... Pepponi?
__label__neutral No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
__label__neutral Joey... Switzerland?
__label__neutral Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.
__label__non-neutral Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.
__label__neutral Which I'm not.
__label__non-neutral Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
__label__neutral Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
__label__neutral Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
__label__non-neutral Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
__label__neutral Might wanna try Joseph.
__label__non-neutral Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
__label__joy Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
__label__surprise Are you kidding?
__label__neutral Okay, look.
__label__non-neutral I-I studied evolution.
__label__non-neutral Remember, evolution?
__label__non-neutral Monkey into man?
__label__neutral Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey.
__label__non-neutral Im Doctor Monkey!
__label__neutral Im not arguing with that.
__label__non-neutral All right, Ive heard enough. Ive made my decision.
__label__disgust You are both idiots.
__label__disgust The joke is not funny, and its offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys!
__label__anger You shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!
__label__anger Now let it go!
__label__anger The joke sucks!
__label__neutral Its your joke.
__label__anger Is not.
__label__non-neutral Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
__label__joy I didnt!
__label__neutral Even when I found outumm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
__label__non-neutral Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
__label__surprise Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
__label__neutral Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and
__label__non-neutral Did you, did you
__label__neutral No.
__label__non-neutral Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
__label__joy Yes!
__label__anger Then don't touch one!!
__label__surprise Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy Thanks!
__label__neutral All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
__label__joy Done!
__label__non-neutral And it can't be Joey.
__label__neutral It's not.
__label__neutral Or Joseph.
__label__non-neutral Oh.
__label__neutral Hi!
__label__joy Hi! Hey, Pete youre back! Hey, check this out.
__label__joy Wow! Skates!
__label__surprise Wow! Youre a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was youre trip?
__label__neutral Well...
__label__non-neutral Oh, whatd ya bring me?!
__label__non-neutral Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan.
__label__joy Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection.
__label__neutral You want some coffee?
__label__neutral Yeah, sure, thatd be great.
__label__neutral Regular or decaf?
__label__neutral Ah, which ever is closest.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral So ask me what I did today.
__label__neutral So what did you do today Pete?
__label__joy I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
__label__surprise What?! Oh.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Where've you been?
__label__neutral At the vet.
__label__fear She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
__label__non-neutral She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
__label__joy Hey! He beat ya.
__label__sadness She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
__label__neutral So what does this mean?
__label__sadness I'm gonna have to give him up.
__label__anger Aww man! I cant believe I locked myself out again!
__label__non-neutral Hang on buddy!
__label__surprise Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
__label__neutral I sure did.
__label__surprise But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
__label__non-neutral Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
__label__neutral May I come in?
__label__neutral Uh, yeah, if you want too.
__label__neutral Do
__label__neutral Yeah, sure?
__label__neutral So do I.
__label__neutral Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.
__label__neutral This is just about tonight.
__label__neutral I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us."
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__non-neutral I just want this to be  about what it is!
__label__non-neutral And um, what-what is that Ross?
__label__joy The physical act of love.
__label__surprise What?! Are you crazy?
__label__surprise Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
__label__surprise Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
__label__non-neutral You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
__label__non-neutral Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
__label__non-neutral No! No!  No!  No-no-no-no.
__label__surprise Ohh wow! Im sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
__label__neutral Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
__label__fear It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's gonna kill me.
__label__neutral Yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there.
__label__neutral Ah Joey.
__label__neutral Joey Tribbiani.
__label__neutral Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
__label__non-neutral So, does that mean the audition is off?
__label__neutral Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Aw come on Joey, it's easy.
__label__neutral Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!

__label__surprise Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
__label__surprise Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!
__label__surprise !
__label__neutral Hi there.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__neutral Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!
__label__neutral So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
__label__anger Oh, DAMN IT!
__label__neutral Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
__label__neutral Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__neutral Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
__label__non-neutral Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
__label__non-neutral We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
__label__joy Yeah! C'mon!
__label__neutral Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
__label__neutral Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
__label__neutral No, she's at a faculty meeting.
__label__neutral Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...
__label__neutral Come in.
__label__neutral Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
__label__neutral What's it look like?
__label__neutral Kinda like a big face without skin.
__label__neutral Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
__label__surprise Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
__label__neutral Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
__label__joy Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
__label__neutral Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
__label__surprise The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
__label__non-neutral What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
__label__surprise You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
__label__neutral I have no idea what you just said.
__label__neutral Put Joey on the phone.
__label__non-neutral What's up man?
__label__fear I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth
__label__non-neutral Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Chandler, listen.
__label__neutral Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
__label__neutral and that was all before 10 oclock.
__label__neutral The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.
__label__neutral And then the florist phoned to say there arent any tulips.
__label__neutral Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.
__label__neutral Were not gonna be
__label__surprise Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?
__label__anger Well, up yours too!
__label__neutral Wheres Chandler?
__label__surprise Ah, he cant make it, he said he had to his...  Whoa-oh!
__label__neutral Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
__label__neutral Joey I can see you okay? Youre hiding behind the coats.
__label__neutral Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
__label__non-neutral Well, if you dont have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
__label__joy Yeah! You wanna come?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Fine.
__label__neutral Fine.
__label__neutral Fine.
__label__neutral Fine.
__label__neutral All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral Whats the matter?
__label__disgust Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
__label__surprise Oh Willies still alive!
__label__neutral What are you guys doing?
__label__non-neutral Oh, my mom called, theyre gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so were looking for a good picture of us.
__label__neutral Oooh, Im afraid that does not exist.
__label__surprise Thats not true, there are great pictures of us!
__label__neutral No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whos going like this
__label__surprise Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the
__label__sadness I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture.
__label__joy Oh, heres a great one.
__label__neutral Yeah, Im not in that.
__label__joy I know, but look at me: all tan.
__label__neutral Hey, why dont you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.
__label__joy Thats a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Yknow
__label__neutral Yeah thats great! Next to that, Chandler wont look so stupid.
__label__neutral Chandler what do you say?
__label__neutral All right, but I should warn you, Im not going. Im going.
__label__surprise	Why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
__label__non-neutral	Oh. Thats so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, Wheres number 27?!
__label__neutral	Y'know what?
__label__neutral	It didnt.
__label__joy	Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what Ive got with Alice.
__label__surprise	Now, wh-what, what is that like?
__label__joy	Its so cool man, its so, its just cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
__label__neutral	Yeah, yeah.
__label__non-neutral	Why cant I find that?
__label__anger	Dont ask me, I had it and I blew it!
__label__non-neutral	Well, I want it!
__label__non-neutral	You can have it!
__label__non-neutral	I dont know, maybe I cant. I mean, maybe theres something wrong with me.
__label__non-neutral	Oh, no! No!
__label__joy	Its out there man! Ive seen it! I got it!!
__label__non-neutral	Then you hold on to it!!
__label__joy	All right, man!!
__label__joy	All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
__label__neutral	Come on, Lydia, you can do it.
__label__joy	Push!
__label__joy	Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder.
__label__joy	Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out!
__label__joy	Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho.
__label__joy	Let's  I was justyeah, right.
__label__joy	Push!
__label__joy	Push!
__label__neutral	Okay.
__label__neutral	Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
__label__non-neutral	Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
__label__surprise	Okay, go left. Left! Left!
__label__anger	Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
__label__non-neutral	Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!
__label__non-neutral	Straight up over your head!
__label__joy	You can do it!
__label__joy	You can do it!
__label__neutral	Okay.
__label__neutral	You got it?
__label__neutral	Oh, okay, I get it.
__label__fear	No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even
__label__neutral	Howard's the
__label__neutral	Yes but too me he's just, man.
__label__non-neutral	Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
__label__disgust	Ugh, can you believe that guy!
__label__neutral	Yeah. I really like his glasses.
__label__surprise	Ohh!
__label__neutral	What?
__label__surprise	It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
__label__surprise	Oh my God!
__label__neutral	Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
__label__fear	Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
__label__disgust	Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!
__label__non-neutral	Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I dont have time!
__label__neutral	Theyre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
__label__non-neutral	Youre coming on to the entire room!  Im Chandler.
__label__neutral	Hi.
__label__neutral	Hi.
__label__neutral	You mind if I
__label__neutral	No, please.
__label__neutral	So uh, what are you in for?
__label__neutral	I talk in my sleep.
__label__neutral	What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
__label__neutral	So why dont you give me your number?
__label__neutral	Previously on Friends.
__label__neutral	I dont know exactly. Its-its sorta like wrestling.
__label__surprise	Oh?!
__label__neutral	Yeah, but without the costumes.
__label__neutral	Oh.
__label__neutral	And its not fake, its totally brutal.
__label__neutral	Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Theyre
__label__surprise	So you can like, bite, and pull peoples hair and stuff?
__label__neutral	Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
__label__surprise	Whats fish hooking?
__label__neutral	Huh, whats fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
__label__non-neutral	What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
__label__non-neutral	Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
__label__joy	Well, that makes me feel so good.
__label__neutral	It was just so awkward and bumpy.
__label__surprise	Bumpy?
__label__neutral	Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.
__label__neutral	And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
__label__non-neutral	Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
__label__non-neutral	Coming through!  Oh! Coming through!  Oh! Hello! Hi!  No! Right! Coming through!
__label__neutral	Oh well, its not so bad.
__label__sadness	Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
__label__surprise	Oh!
__label__surprise	My God!
__label__neutral	Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
__label__surprise	Excuse me?
__label__non-neutral	Joey! Hes working!  You would look
__label__non-neutral	Oh, how bad is it?
__label__sadness	Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that isnt burned is an ass. Which I do
__label__neutral	Hows your room Rach?
__label__sadness	Everythings ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
__label__neutral	Isnt that mine?
__label__non-neutral	Fine! Im sorry for your loss!
__label__neutral	So uh, youre not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
__label__non-neutral	Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am
__label__neutral	Yes, they can stay with us.
__label__neutral	Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
__label__non-neutral	Theres just so much pressure.
__label__neutral	I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.
__label__neutral	I dont know if youd understand.
__label__neutral	Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
__label__non-neutral	Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!
__label__neutral	Well, yknow.
__label__fear	I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time.
__label__neutral	So Im gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on.
__label__neutral	Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that.
__label__neutral	Okay.
__label__neutral	Okay.
__label__non-neutral	Whats all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
__label__neutral	Ross, we can handle this.
__label__sadness	Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.
__label__anger	I mean, enough of the silliness!
__label__anger	Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!
__label__non-neutral	Okay-okay!
__label__non-neutral	Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together.
__label__non-neutral	Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?
__label__non-neutral	That is so silly.
__label__neutral	Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
__label__neutral	Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
__label__joy	Love is the best medicine.
__label__non-neutral	Thats laughter.
__label__neutral	Why do you do it?
__label__neutral	I dont know.
__label__neutral	Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
__label__neutral	Yeah, I do.
__label__neutral	And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, dont ya?
__label__neutral	Yes.
__label__joy	Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
__label__neutral	Oh.
__label__neutral	But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
__label__neutral	Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
__label__surprise	You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
__label__neutral	Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.
__label__non-neutral	Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!
__label__non-neutral	Define me!
__label__non-neutral	Love me, I need love!
__label__neutral	'.
__label__surprise	Have you really done this before?
__label__joy	Yeah!
__label__joy	Yeah!
__label__joy	Yeah!
__label__neutral	You just take a big, big swing.
__label__neutral	Now, dont hold back.
__label__neutral	and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
__label__joy	Hey!
__label__joy	Hey-hey-hey!
__label__neutral	What are you doing?
__label__joy	Were just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
__label__neutral	Oh, all right.
__label__joy	Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
__label__non-neutral	Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
__label__joy	Okay!
__label__neutral	All right.
__label__neutral	Bye!
__label__neutral	Bye!
__label__non-neutral	Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
__label__neutral	Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
__label__neutral	Yeah.
__label__neutral	Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey.
__label__neutral	Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
__label__neutral	Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
__label__surprise	Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one!
__label__neutral	Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
__label__neutral	Okay.
__label__neutral	Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials?
__label__non-neutral	Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down?
__label__neutral	Because we can remember them.
__label__non-neutral	Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
__label__neutral	Hey. When you guys were kids and you played
__label__neutral	I was always Joanne.
__label__neutral	Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! the war cry of your neighbourhood?
__label__disgust	Ewww! Oh! Its the Mattress King!
__label__non-neutral	Booo!!
__label__disgust	Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
__label__joy	Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
__label__anger	What a wank!
__label__anger	Oh, I cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses.
__label__non-neutral	I know!
__label__non-neutral	And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.
__label__non-neutral	And Im appalled for you by the way.
__label__non-neutral	You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it alone.
__label__disgust	Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my food.
__label__anger	Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
__label__disgust	Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
__label__neutral	Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
__label__fear	Im, Im freaking out!
__label__fear	Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have!
__label__neutral	All right, I havent lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.
__label__neutral	Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
__label__neutral	Um. yeah.
__label__neutral	I am
__label__neutral	All right, look, heres the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.
__label__neutral	So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
__label__non-neutral	Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work.
__label__neutral	Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but thats why you have got to be the bigger man here.
__label__non-neutral	Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me!
__label__non-neutral	Like me tiny doctor!
__label__non-neutral	Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
__label__non-neutral	Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along.
__label__anger	Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.
__label__non-neutral	Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna have to have a separate room for you too!
__label__anger	!
__label__neutral	Okay, okay, okay.  Ill get the bagels.
__label__neutral	Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
__label__neutral	All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
__label__neutral	Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
__label__surprise	Really? A purse?
__label__non-neutral	It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
__label__neutral	It looks like a women's purse.
__label__neutral	No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,
__label__neutral	See look,
__label__neutral	Exactly! Unisex!
__label__neutral	Maybe you need sex.
__label__non-neutral	No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
__label__neutral	Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
__label__neutral	So, um, have you told your parents?
__label__neutral	No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
__label__neutral	Here you go.
__label__neutral	You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.
__label__neutral	.
__label__neutral	.
__label__non-neutral	no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.
__label__joy	I love you Phoebe.
__label__surprise	So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
__label__joy	Hey!
__label__neutral	Hi.
__label__neutral	I just came over to drop offnothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
__label__non-neutral	Yeah, it did.
__label__sadness	So, I guess this is over.
__label__neutral	What?
__label__sadness	Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
__label__non-neutral	Why, exactly?
__label__sadness	Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
__label__surprise	Chandler that's crazy!
__label__anger	If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!
__label__neutral	So, this isn't over?
__label__joy	You are so cute!
__label__non-neutral	No.
__label__neutral	No, it was a fight.
__label__non-neutral	You deal with it and move on!
__label__neutral	It's nothing to freak out about.
__label__joy	Really? Okay. Great!
__label__joy	Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
__label__surprise	We're in a relationship?
__label__neutral	I'm afraid so.
__label__neutral	Okay.
__label__joy	Hi!
__label__neutral	So you like the short hair better.
__label__neutral	What? YetiI mean Danny?
__label__neutral	Can I tell you a little secret?
__label__joy	Yeah!
__label__neutral	I want to keep one.
__label__joy	Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
__label__neutral	Oh, please.
__label__neutral	What? Honey.
__label__neutral	Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
__label__sadness	Oh God, Im so sorry.
__label__neutral	I know.
__label__non-neutral	Ow!!
__label__surprise	Oh God!
__label__non-neutral	Hey, you guys! Guess what?
__label__neutral	Got a job on a river boat?
__label__non-neutral	Y'know what I didnt wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? Youre not my girlfriend anymore so...
__label__neutral	Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
__label__neutral	Right.
__label__non-neutral	Now that youre on youre own, youre free to look as stupid as you like.
__label__neutral	You like it right?
__label__neutral	Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! Im kidding!
__label__neutral	Yeah, come here!
__label__neutral	What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
__label__neutral	Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
__label__anger	Okay, good bye!
__label__joy	Hey I got one! I got one!
__label__joy	Hi!
__label__neutral	Hi.
__label__neutral	Oh uh, up or down?
__label__non-neutral	Oh down please.  I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?
__label__neutral	Could you press up too please?
__label__sadness	Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
__label__neutral	Oh yeah? Howd yours happen?
__label__neutral	Well, its a long story.
__label__neutral	Its kind of embarrassing.
__label__non-neutral	Lets just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
__label__neutral	How about you?
__label__sadness	Car accident.
__label__neutral	Oh.
__label__non-neutral	Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasnt paying attention?
__label__neutral	Yeah. Me.  Oh hey, thats me.  Hey uh, I take it youre just visiting someone.
__label__neutral	Uh-huh, yeah.
__label__neutral	Well umm, if you have sometime yknow and maybe you might want to visit someone else
__label__joy	Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
__label__neutral	Im in the middle
__label__anger	Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
__label__neutral	Uh, you gotta press the button.
__label__neutral	Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
__label__surprise	Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
__label__neutral	Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car.    We're way ahead of the game.
__label__surprise	Oh my god.
__label__surprise	What?
__label__surprise	There's something new in the bowl.
__label__non-neutral	Look, we have enough, just walk away.
__label__joy	No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
__label__neutral	There's a forest right outside.
__label__neutral	It's not the same.
__label__non-neutral	Ok, go quick!
__label__joy	Thank you for a delightful stay.
__label__joy	Oh, my maple candy!
__label__surprise	Oh my God, what happened?
__label__non-neutral	Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
__label__joy	Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
__label__non-neutral	Oh,  I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
__label__surprise	Ross's what?
__label__disgust	You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.
__label__neutral	Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
__label__surprise	Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! Thats my Dad, thats Frank! Yeah! Im sorry Im getting all flingy.
__label__joy	Take it easy--if you want, theres cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria!  I can make sangria!
__label__neutral	No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
__label__neutral	Oh.
__label__neutral	Well, so, umm, anyway umm, Ive been, Ive been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
__label__sadness	Oh no, I-Im sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.
__label__neutral	Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
__label__neutral	Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.
__label__surprise	Oh, what? What was it?
__label__non-neutral	The three losers.
__label__sadness	Oh, poor Lily.
__label__sadness	Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
__label__non-neutral	Yeah, no, it was great.
__label__sadness	Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her,  burping her, oh try this one!
__label__anger	Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
__label__neutral	Alright here's something, it says to try holding the baby  close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
__label__neutral	Ok.
__label__surprise	It worked!
__label__non-neutral	Oh  oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit.
__label__non-neutral	Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it  won't stop crying.
__label__neutral	Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
__label__neutral	Yeah, I'm not so sure.
__label__non-neutral	Oh my god, I am losing my mind.
__label__non-neutral	Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from  having sex with Ross!
__label__neutral	Well, youre not.
__label__disgust	Oh, its so easy for you I mean, youre not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
__label__joy	Yeah I can!  And dont think I dont, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
__label__surprise	Monica. Youve, youve done it right?
__label__anger	Of course I have! What do you think, Im some 30 year old virgin?
__label__surprise	Oh my God! Youre a 30 year old virgin!
__label__disgust	Say it louder, I dont think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
__label__anger	Its not like, I havent any opportunities.
__label__neutral	I mean, yknow, Im just waiting for the perfect guy.
__label__neutral	Im seeing this guy Roger, all right?
__label__neutral	Hes not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.
__label__neutral	Yknow, give him my flower.
__label__surprise	Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, youve waited
__label__surprise	Yknow what? You are right?!
__label__joy	Yes!!
__label__non-neutral	I mean sex does not have to be a big deal!
__label__non-neutral	There shouldnt be all this rules and restrictions!
__label__neutral	Yknow, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever
__label__non-neutral	Rachel! Im never gonna think its okay for you to cheat on your husband!
__label__non-neutral	Oh what do you know? Virgin!
__label__neutral	Push, push!
__label__non-neutral	We're here!
__label__neutral	Where have you been?
__label__neutral	Long story, honey.
__label__neutral	All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?
__label__neutral	C'mon up.
__label__non-neutral	Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
__label__anger	So, I hear, you hate me!
__label__neutral	I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
__label__non-neutral	A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
__label__non-neutral	And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
__label__anger	All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.
__label__neutral	So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.
__label__non-neutral	But what does that gonna do...
__label__non-neutral	For Chandler!
__label__joy	Guess what, I got an audition!
__label__joy	Awww, one of my students got an audition. Im so proud.
__label__neutral	I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
__label__joy	You bet! Whats the part?
__label__joy	Oh its great, its a role on
__label__neutral	Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
__label__neutral	I thought he was with you.
__label__neutral	He-he was with me umm, were playing a little game, yknow? Hide and seek.
__label__neutral	You cant ask us son, thats cheating.
__label__neutral	Youre right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
__label__neutral	Well, he better not come by here. He cant see the bride in the wedding dress.
__label__non-neutral	As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
__label__neutral	But that was after the wedding, its not bad luck then.
__label__neutral	Honey, it isnt good luck.
__label__surprise	Oh my God! Monica!
__label__neutral	I know! Hey, hows Chandler doin?
__label__neutral	Great. Hes doing great. Dont you worry about Chandler.
__label__neutral	Are you okay?
__label__neutral	Uh-huh.
__label__joy	Yeah baby!
__label__neutral	Im really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.
__label__neutral	So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
__label__non-neutral	Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
__label__non-neutral	I cant believe it! He still hasnt called.
__label__surprise	Who, Josh?
__label__non-neutral	Its Joshua.
__label__surprise	What, he doesnt like Josh?
__label__disgust	No, I dont.
__label__neutral	All right, well Im gonna put my sweats back on.
__label__surprise	Oh no!
__label__fear	Wait!
__label__surprise	Wait!
__label__non-neutral	Okay, yknow what, you were right, you were right.
__label__non-neutral	We really werent great at being guys, but you know why?
__label__neutral	Because were girls.
__label__neutral	Phoebe, his music could not

__label__non-neutral	Yeah, I lost it.
__label__neutral	Yknow, Im not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?
__label__surprise	After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
__label__neutral	Yeah, like I could
__label__surprise	What?
__label__non-neutral	I played bad on purpose guys.
__label__surprise	Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
__label__neutral	Yeahno, just that last song.
__label__neutral	Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
__label__neutral	Oh yeah, whos playing?
__label__neutral	The players.
__label__neutral	Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
__label__neutral	Please, its a relief is what it is, is what it is.
__label__neutral	All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
__label__neutral	Oh.
__label__neutral	Anything?
__label__non-neutral	No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasnt heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandlers parents again!
__label__non-neutral	You told them he was missing?
__label__neutral	No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think Im interested in them.
__label__neutral	Whose is it?
__label__neutral	I dont want to say.
__label__non-neutral	Oh, come on! I dont care! Come on! Whose is it?
__label__neutral	Diane Keaton.
__label__anger	Phoebe! Come on! Lets go!  Come on!  Why arent you dressed yet?!
__label__neutral	Im sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
__label__neutral	No, Phoebe, Ill tell you what, if you get ready now Ill let you play it at the wedding.
__label__surprise	Really?!
__label__joy	Oh thats so exciting!
__label__joy	Thank you!
__label__joy	Thanks Mon!
__label__anger	Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again Ill have to pound on you for a little bit.
__label__neutral	Fair enough, now go get ready!
__label__neutral	Okay.
__label__neutral	Ill get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my Im sorry, uh apparently Ive opened the door to the past.

__label__non-neutral	Dont care what people say.
__label__joy	My feets best friends, pals to the end.
__label__joy	With them Im one hot chicky.
__label__neutral	Though late one night, not much light, I....
__label__non-neutral	I stepped in something icky.
__label__joy	Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time Ill.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.

__label__sadness	No more J and Cs.
__label__neutral	"You wanna go over to Joey and Chandlers?"
__label__neutral	"Cant, its not there."
__label__neutral	Look, Im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
__label__sadness	Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
__label__neutral	Not once did we do that.
__label__neutral	Hi.
__label__neutral	Hey!
__label__neutral	Hi.
__label__neutral	So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
__label__neutral	Oh yeah? Well, howd she take it?
__label__neutral	Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didnt cry. She wasnt angry or sad.
__label__neutral	Uh-huh.
__label__neutral	Im not going to do that.
__label__neutral	Okay, if you need the vacuum, its in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator
__label__neutral	Okay, okay, but Rachels gonna be here too, cant I just ask her this stuff?
__label__neutral	Yeah, okay, give that a try!
__label__joy	All right! Lets do it!
__label__joy	Woo-hoo!!
__label__joy	Yeah, cheerie-o!
__label__joy	London baby!
__label__joy	Hi!
__label__joy	Hi!
__label__neutral	Monica? What time is it?
__label__neutral	Uhh, 9.
__label__neutral	But it's dark out.
__label__neutral	Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
__label__neutral	I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
__label__neutral	I'm
__label__neutral	I know, me too.
__label__joy	Hey!
__label__non-neutral	Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?
__label__joy	Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
__label__non-neutral	All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
__label__neutral	Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
__label__joy	Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
__label__neutral	Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
__label__neutral	Wait! What about Joey?
__label__neutral	Oh umm, theres also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?
__label__neutral	Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
__label__non-neutral	Im so sorry!
__label__non-neutral	Sorry!
__label__neutral	You didnt bring
__label__joy	Hey!
__label__joy	Hi!
__label__neutral	Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
__label__neutral	Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
__label__disgust	To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, youre
__label__neutral	No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
__label__surprise	Oh, youre switching apartments?
__label__neutral	Its not for me, its for Rachel.
__label__neutral	But Rachel has an apartment.
__label__neutral	Yeah, but when the baby comes shes gonna want to move.
__label__surprise	She is?
__label__surprise	Yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you?
__label__neutral	I guess I didnt really think about it.
__label__non-neutral	Ezel!  Hey Gunther! Youre an ezel!
__label__anger	Damnit!
__label__surprise	Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people?
__label__neutral	Little village people.
__label__joy	Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
__label__joy	Oh, that is so sweet!
__label__joy	I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
__label__neutral	Huh. Except, Phoebes not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
__label__sadness	Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies.
__label__sadness	Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
__label__surprise	Wait a minute!
__label__joy	Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after shes done being pregnant.
__label__neutral	Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
__label__joy	Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants shes always wanted!
__label__joy	Oh, shes gonna love that!
__label__neutral	Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
__label__neutral	Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
__label__neutral	So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
__label__anger	Fine, Im mentally unstable.
__label__neutral	And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
__label__surprise	What?!
__label__neutral	Uh yes, heroin and crack.
__label__anger	Crack isnt even an intravenous drug!
__label__neutral	Well, you would know.
__label__neutral	Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
__label__non-neutral	Oh, come on!
__label__non-neutral	Ross, please, I found the magazines!
__label__non-neutral	No!
__label__neutral	Phoebe just because I'm alone doesnt mean I wanna walk around naked.
__label__neutral	I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
__label__non-neutral	Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
__label__sadness	I know, I lied! I didnt want her to think I was a terrible mother! I cant even see my own baby!
__label__neutral	Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  its-its-its, its right there .
__label__joy	Oh. Oh, its beautiful. I see it now.
__label__neutral	Do you really?
__label__anger	No, I dont see it!
__label__joy	Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this?  This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
__label__neutral	Yeah.
__label__joy	Sweetie thats it.
__label__joy	Thats it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
__label__neutral	Youre welcome.
__label__surprise	Wow! I cant believe thats our baby.
__label__joy	Yeah, thats our baby.
__label__neutral	Gin.
__label__joy	We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
__label__non-neutral	Will you stop!
__label__neutral	Okay. All right.
__label__joy	Okay, all right, I think youre great, I think youre sweet, and youre smart, and I love you.
__label__disgust	But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
__label__joy	Hey!
__label__joy	Hey!
__label__joy	Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
__label__joy	Hey, check me out, Im a slut!
__label__neutral	So you uh, want to do something tonight?
__label__neutral	Oh I cant. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
__label__neutral	Oh.
__label__surprise	Oh right!
__label__surprise	Right!
__label__sadness	Because youre still seeing him and uh, hes a good guy.
__label__sadness	I mean, I remember a time when
__label__neutral	Are you okay?
__label__joy	Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
__label__joy	Great! Its so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was
__label__neutral	I bet he can.
__label__neutral	Yknow, I dont have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure youre okay?
__label__non-neutral	Oh yeah! Yeah! Dont worry about me, Ill be fine!
__label__neutral	You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
__label__neutral	Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
__label__non-neutral	Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
__label__non-neutral	Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby?
__label__neutral	Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
__label__non-neutral	oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks.
__label__surprise	I can't believe    I didn't even think of that.
__label__non-neutral	I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...
__label__non-neutral	What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?
__label__non-neutral	It was a "Wendy's!!    "
__label__surprise	...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
__label__disgust	Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else?
__label__surprise	Like you, I dont even know where you work?
__label__neutral	Yeah.
__label__non-neutral	Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a
__label__neutral	Hey.
__label__neutral	Hey!
__label__anger	So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
__label__neutral	Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think Ill show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
__label__non-neutral	Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
__label__non-neutral	Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
__label__non-neutral	Yeah!
__label__neutral	Well, Im not going to go now anyway .
__label__neutral	Okay .
__label__neutral	Here you go.
__label__neutral	Ah, Gunther, I cant pay for this right now because Im not working, so Ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin for stuff.
__label__neutral	Well, if you want, you can work here.
__label__neutral	Uh, I dont know.
__label__neutral	Ya see, its just, see I was a regular on a soap opera yknow?
__label__sadness	And to go from that to this, I just Plus, Id have to wait on all my friends.
__label__neutral	Okay, but the moneys good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
__label__surprise	What?!
__label__neutral	Flexible hours.
__label__neutral	Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
__label__neutral	I have no name.
__label__neutral	All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
__label__neutral	Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
__label__disgust	No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
__label__surprise	Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
__label__neutral	Umm, Gene.
__label__anger	Its Clint. Its Clint!
__label__neutral	See you later, Gene.
__label__neutral	Bye, Gene.
__label__anger	Its Clint!
__label__non-neutral	Whats up with Gene?
__label__neutral	Welcome to Las Vegas.
__label__joy	Thank you!  Enjoy your flight?
__label__joy	Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
__label__neutral	Hope you had a nice flight.
__label__joy	Ohh, it was the best!
__label__neutral	Oh, Larry.
__label__neutral	Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
__label__neutral	No, bribes.
__label__non-neutral	It's okay to laugh right?
__label__non-neutral	Come on Joey!!!
__label__non-neutral	Rach, I told you everything I knew last night!
__label__neutral	Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
__label__non-neutral	I can't believe you would say that!
__label__neutral	Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
__label__non-neutral	No! I mean come on! This is a
__label__neutral	I don't know.
__label__non-neutral	Is he romantic with her?
__label__neutral	I don't know.
__label__non-neutral	Are they in love?
__label__neutral	I don't know.
__label__anger	You don't know anything.
__label__non-neutral	Ohh, I know one thing!
__label__non-neutral	What?
__label__non-neutral	They did it right there on the couch.
__label__non-neutral	Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in.
__label__non-neutral	I mean, that guy with the toe thing?
__label__neutral	Who's he sleeping with?
__label__neutral	Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...
__label__neutral	I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.
__label__non-neutral	Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-!
__label__neutral	So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.
__label__neutral	So where did you study?
__label__neutral	Oh, I didn't go to college.
__label__neutral	No, where did you study acting?
__label__neutral	Molly ... people don't study acting ...
__label__neutral	Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
__label__neutral	Sure, I'll go check on Emma.
__label__neutral	Thanx.
__label__sadness	Will the stable boy never get the princess??
__label__disgust	What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here    on my couch?
__label__non-neutral	No ... the leather sticks to my ass.
__label__anger	You know, this isn't fair.
__label__anger	What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?
__label__non-neutral	Huh?
__label__anger	Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?
__label__non-neutral	Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?
__label__sadness	I didn't think I could ever love again.
__label__non-neutral	Come on! Joe!
__label__neutral	Ok
__label__neutral	Hi, is Molly here?
__label__neutral	Yeah, come on in. Molly?
__label__neutral	Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha .  I'll see you tomorrow.
__label__neutral	Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess    we have no problem.
__label__joy	It's like my favorite fairy tale come true!  The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!
__label__non-neutral	And whats cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
__label__neutral	Yeah.
__label__non-neutral	My whole familys from Naples!
__label__surprise	Oh thats great! Okay, well Ive heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie
__label__non-neutral	Joey, this is the awkward part.
__label__surprise	Oh!

__label__neutral	I totally understand.
__label__non-neutral	You need to yknow make sure I dont have any horrible scars or tattoos.
__label__non-neutral	Dont you worry; I have nothing to hide.
__label__neutral	So there you go, thats me.
__label__joy	One hundred percent natural!
__label__non-neutral	I tell ya, that has never happened before.
__label__neutral	This rooms available.
__label__joy	Okay!
__label__non-neutral	Okay wait!
__label__anger	You listen to me!
__label__anger	You listen to me!
__label__non-neutral	Since I have been waiting four women, thats four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies!
__label__anger	Im next!
__label__anger	Its my turn!
__label__anger	Its only fair!
__label__anger	And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me Im going to sue you!
__label__anger	Not this hospital, Im going to sue you!
__label__non-neutral	And my husband  hes a lawyer!
__label__neutral	Uh Rach
__label__anger	Go get back on that case honey!
__label__neutral	I dont think the next patient is very far along.
__label__neutral	Okay, well then bring her in.
__label__surprise	OH.MY.GAWD!!!
__label__fear	Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that oneDude! Theyre all huge!
__label__non-neutral	They dont look any bigger than me!
__label__non-neutral	Well, maybe thats because youre closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
__label__neutral	Im just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
__label__neutral	All right.
__label__neutral	Okay.
__label__neutral	Hi.
__label__joy	Whoa!  I kinda liked it.
__label__non-neutral	Okay, I know what I have to do. Ive got to go Red Ross.  Yknow, Red Ross!
__label__non-neutral	I totally dont know what youre talking about.
__label__non-neutral	Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for
__label__non-neutral	Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
__label__neutral	No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportive like crazy.
__label__neutral	Yeah.
__label__neutral	We just want you to think it through.
__label__neutral	Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody whos had a baby. Like your mom?
__label__neutral	My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
__label__neutral	Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
__label__neutral	Thank you. All right.
__label__neutral	Come, sit.
__label__neutral	Sit.
__label__anger	Sit!
__label__neutral	Umm, all righty, before we get started I justI need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
__label__neutral	Lucky sixes....
__label__neutral	Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
__label__neutral	Hi!
__label__neutral	And Joey....
__label__neutral	Hi!
__label__neutral	And Ross.
__label__neutral	Hi!
__label__neutral	He doesn't speak much English.
__label__surprise	Look at that!
__label__neutral	So, um... where did Paolo come from?
__label__neutral	Oh... Italy, I think.
__label__neutral	No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
__label__neutral	Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
__label__neutral	That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
__label__neutral	Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
__label__neutral	Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
__label__non-neutral	Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
__label__neutral	Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
__label__non-neutral	You betcha!
__label__surprise	Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
__label__neutral	When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
__label__anger	That cup is mine!
__label__anger	No its not! You want it, youre gonna have to win it!
__label__non-neutral	All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
__label__non-neutral	Why?
__label__neutral	Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
__label__neutral	Okay.
__label__neutral	You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
__label__neutral	I know I do.
__label__neutral	Hi.
__label__neutral	Hi.
__label__neutral	Guess what?
__label__neutral	What?
__label__joy	They published my paper.
__label__joy	Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
__label__non-neutral	Rach, look!  Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.  There he is.
__label__surprise	Oh my God.
__label__neutral	You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
__label__neutral	Oh.
__label__anger	What?! You got us evicted!!
__label__anger	I told you not to go down there!
__label__disgust	Well he made Rachel cry!
__label__anger	Rachel always cries!
__label__anger	Thats not true!
__label__neutral	Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like youve never sucked before!
__label__neutral	All right! Ill try! But if I cant, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
__label__anger	Go!!
__label__neutral	All right, all right, all right.
__label__neutral	I mean Ill have to check with him first, but Ill think hell be cool with it.
__label__non-neutral	So, hes just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesnt want anything in exchange for helping him?
__label__neutral	Well, I assume Ill have to take showers with him, but y'know, thats true of any job.
__label__neutral	How ya feelin?
__label__neutral	Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it.
__label__neutral	Whered you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
__label__neutral	Yeah.
__label__neutral	Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
__label__joy	Woooo hoooo!!!
__label__non-neutral	Ow, no woo-hooing, no woo-hooing.
__label__surprise	Why, what happened?
__label__non-neutral	Ah, I fooled around with Joeys sister.  Well, thats not the worst part.
__label__neutral	What is the worse part?
__label__non-neutral	I cant remember which sister.
__label__anger	You see what men do! Dont tell me men are not nice!  This is men!!
__label__non-neutral	Whats wrong with you?
__label__anger	Nothing!
__label__sadness	Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.
__label__neutral	But um, I dont think its anything serious.
__label__surprise	This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-youGo to the doctor!
__label__anger	No way!
__label__non-neutral	Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
__label__disgust	Why did I have to start working out again?
__label__anger	Damn you 15s!
__label__neutral	Its a trifle.
__label__neutral	Its got all of these layers.
__label__neutral	First theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.
__label__non-neutral	[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like somethings wrong.]
__label__neutral	then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
__label__disgust	It tastes like feet!
__label__joy	I like it.
__label__surprise	Are you kidding?
__label__neutral	Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
__label__neutral	No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
__label__joy	Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
__label__joy	Oh, oh! It's on again!
__label__disgust	You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
__label__anger	Shhhh!
__label__neutral	Folks, has this ever happened to you.
__label__neutral	You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
__label__non-neutral	Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!
__label__neutral	And there is Kevin.
__label__non-neutral	Can we please turn this off?
__label__non-neutral	Noo way, Kevin.
__label__neutral	There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
__label__surprise	Are you intrigued?
__label__joy	You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
__label__non-neutral	Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.
__label__neutral	Go ahead.
__label__neutral	This works with any milk carton.
__label__surprise	Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.
__label__neutral	Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay.
__label__non-neutral	She is not  Shes gay. Oh my God. She is
__label__surprise	Good day for married people huh?
__label__sadness	Im sorry your husband cheated on you.
__label__non-neutral	Im sorry your wife is gay. I guess women arent that great either.
__label__non-neutral	Try telling my wife that.
__label__neutral	Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
__label__joy	I can't wait to be with you!
__label__neutral	I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.
__label__neutral	I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
__label__non-neutral	Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
__label__non-neutral	Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
__label__disgust	Arghh!!
__label__non-neutral	I cant believe Im going to lose this job!
__label__sadness	Oh Im so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
__label__neutral	Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
__label__neutral	Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
__label__neutral	Yeah?
__label__anger	Well, I dont want to talk to you Wayne!
__label__anger	I hate you!
__label__anger	You ruined my life!
__label__neutral	Oh, Chandler, Wayne.
__label__neutral	Wayne, Chandler.
__label__neutral	Hi, how are ya?
__label__neutral	Joey, Joey, I-I-Ill g-get you your job back if you help me out.
__label__non-neutral	Why should I help you?!
__label__neutral	The reason he just said.
__label__neutral	What do you need?
__label__neutral	I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, yknow Sarah?
__label__surprise	What?
__label__neutral	And I too am just a love machine.
__label__neutral	Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
__label__surprise	Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out its a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
__label__joy	See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
__label__surprise	You chipped in?!
__label__neutral	Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
__label__surprise	Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
__label__non-neutral	Yeah, but they didn't ask me!
__label__non-neutral	Y'know?
__label__joy	This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger.
__label__joy	That's always fun to be.
__label__anger	Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
__label__neutral	No I'm not.
__label__surprise	No!
__label__non-neutral	If anything I'm making you look better!
__label__joy	They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
__label__joy	Oh hey, Pheebs!
__label__joy	Hey!
__label__neutral	Oh hey, Ross.
__label__fear	Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people.
__label__neutral	Something to think about.
__label__non-neutral	Yeah, okay, my bad.
__label__neutral	Alright, alright, alright...
__label__neutral	Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
__label__neutral	For what?
__label__joy	Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
__label__disgust	Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
__label__joy	Thank you!
__label__neutral	Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
__label__non-neutral	He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
__label__disgust	C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!
__label__neutral	I warned you...
__label__anger	Who is being loud?
__label__neutral	Oh, that would be Monica.
__label__neutral	Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
__label__surprise	Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
__label__neutral	Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
__label__surprise	Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
__label__neutral	No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it.
__label__neutral	'Kay?
__label__neutral	Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life?
__label__neutral	Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
__label__neutral	Sure.
__label__neutral	Oh, um, Chandler?
__label__neutral	Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
__label__joy	Hey Monica, it's Joey!
__label__joy	Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
__label__neutral	Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
__label__neutral	Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?
__label__neutral	Do you have a dressing room?
__label__neutral	Do you have a chair with your name on it?
__label__neutral	Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on.
__label__neutral	Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong!

__label__surprise	Wow, you guys, this is big.
__label__non-neutral	Pants and a sweater?
__label__non-neutral	Why, mom?
__label__non-neutral	Who am I gonna meet in a blackout?
__label__non-neutral	Power company guys?
__label__non-neutral	Eligible looters?
__label__non-neutral	Could we talk about this later?
__label__neutral	OK.

__label__neutral	Well, I never call
__label__neutral	What cha doing?
__label__neutral	Having a swim.
__label__neutral	What about the chick?
__label__neutral	Chicks dont swim.
__label__neutral	Are you sure?
__label__neutral	I dont know. Should we try it?
__label__neutral	Sure.
__label__neutral	See, I told you they dont swim.
__label__neutral	Wait. Give him a minute.
__label__fear	Noo!  Oh, its okay, its okay, baby, baby, baby.
__label__neutral	Me taking care of you is no problem, huh?
__label__neutral	You guys feel safe.
__label__neutral	Right?
__label__neutral	Okay, Im gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!"
__label__neutral	Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, Ill set you up with a clean one.
__label__sadness	Okay, Im sorry.
__label__sadness	I didnt mean to scare you.
__label__neutral	I just have to clean that up.
__label__neutral	Okay?
__label__neutral	Cause lets face it, were at Monicas.
__label__non-neutral	I broke it.
__label__neutral	All right.
__label__neutral	Well, thats just the way that goes.
__label__neutral	Okay, good.
__label__non-neutral	Why are there only two of you?
__label__non-neutral	Where is Leslie?
__label__neutral	Well, you cant answer.
__label__neutral	Leslie?
__label__fear	Where are you Leslie?
__label__non-neutral	Leslie, now would be a
__label__joy	Hey!
__label__neutral	Hey.
__label__non-neutral	Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
__label__neutral	Oh, theres banana on it.
__label__non-neutral	You said she was bald.
__label__neutral	Yeah, she was bald, shes not now.
__label__surprise	How could you not tell me that she has hair?
__label__neutral	I dont know, I hardly ever say that about people.
__label__anger	Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
__label__non-neutral	Well Im sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
__label__non-neutral	Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got
__label__non-neutral	Well, maybe it wont work out. Maybe Ross wont like her personality.
__label__neutral	Why, does she have a bad personality?
__label__non-neutral	Oh no, Bonnies the best!
__label__joy	Hey!
__label__neutral	Hey.
__label__fear	Do you have a minute? Id like to talk to you about something Im, Im really uncomfortable talking about.
__label__non-neutral	Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
__label__non-neutral	I actually had a topic in mind! Im, Im kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
__label__surprise	Whoa, for like months?
__label__joy	Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff yknow, sexually?
__label__surprise	No!
__label__neutral	Oooh, wrong answer.
__label__non-neutral	Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay.  Oh, shhh!
__label__non-neutral	No! No!! Its me! Its me! I-I didnt want to make any noise!
__label__non-neutral	Then don't break in!!
__label__non-neutral	Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
__label__neutral	I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
__label__disgust	Then why are you smoking?
__label__non-neutral	Well its very unsettling.
__label__neutral	Honey, I was wondering....
__label__neutral	Hmm?
__label__non-neutral	Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
__label__non-neutral	Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
__label__neutral	Hmm.
__label__non-neutral	I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
__label__non-neutral	You remember not having sex in high school, right?
__label__sadness	Yeah.
__label__neutral	Well honey, what about you?
__label__neutral	What?
__label__neutral	I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
__label__neutral	No.
__label__surprise	Come on you gotta have one!
__label__disgust	Ugh!
__label__non-neutral	I dont know Monica.
__label__non-neutral	It feels funny just being here.
__label__non-neutral	I mean if you buy a bed from Janices ex-husband, thats like betraying Chandler.
__label__non-neutral	Not at these prices.
__label__joy	Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.  Woo!
__label__joy	Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
__label__surprise	Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandlers your friend...  Oh!
__label__surprise	Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral	Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
__label__joy	You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
__label__non-neutral	Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
__label__anger	By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
__label__neutral	That's OK.
__label__surprise	Oh, are you sure?
__label__surprise	Really?
__label__anger	Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
__label__neutral	We can't do that.
__label__surprise	What? What can't you do?
__label__surprise	She really said that?
__label__neutral	Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...
__label__neutral	But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
__label__surprise	'Tonight' tonight?
__label__joy	Well, I think it's perfect.
__label__neutral	Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
__label__non-neutral	I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
__label__joy	Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
__label__disgust	Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
__label__neutral	Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
__label__neutral	No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
__label__joy	Alright, well, be good, I love you.
__label__anger	You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
__label__sadness	O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
__label__anger	Really stupid.
__label__non-neutral	Really stupid.
__label__non-neutral	And I don't even know how it happened.
__label__sadness	I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.
__label__fear	Are we okay now?
__label__anger	Yeah. No. No...
__label__neutral	Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
__label__neutral	Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
__label__surprise	You're kidding.
__label__neutral	No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
__label__neutral	Oh there it is.
__label__neutral	Thats not your regular dry cleaners.
__label__disgust	I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one.
__label__disgust	I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store
__label__surprise	What?!
__label__neutral	A new grocery store.
__label__non-neutral	The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and thats what they gave me?
__label__anger	When I get up there Im going to kick some ass.
__label__neutral	Dont worry Phoebe, youre gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
__label__neutral	Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
__label__neutral	Oh, you didnt have to come in with me.
__label__non-neutral	Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like
__label__neutral	Okay.
__label__surprise	Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s Wow!
__label__surprise	What?
__label__surprise	Im sorry, its just that youre so incredibly beautiful.
__label__neutral	Oh yeah well, Im sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?
__label__non-neutral	I hope you dont think Im crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
__label__neutral	A little.   Now youre talking.
__label__neutral	Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
__label__joy	I-I-Id love to. Let me just tell my friend.
__label__joy	Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
__label__neutral	She mustve left.
__label__anger	Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
__label__surprise	Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
__label__joy	That's right baby.
__label__neutral	All right, let me in.
__label__non-neutral	No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
__label__surprise	What?
__label__non-neutral	He's a dropper!
__label__non-neutral	Oh yeah, that's right!
__label__anger	I'm not a dropper!
__label__neutral	It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
__label__non-neutral	It's throwing and catching!
__label__neutral	All right.
__label__surprise	Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
__label__non-neutral	Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
__label__surprise	Oh myOh good God!
__label__non-neutral	I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
__label__neutral	Baking it didn't help, huh?
__label__neutral	All right, well the place was closed. Ill just copy it later.
__label__non-neutral	Or not. Uh, Rach, why dont you just move in with me?
__label__surprise	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
__label__neutral	No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no Its okay, I mean Ilook Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursdays thing, but we dont have to do that!
__label__neutral	Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless youre thinking about Naked Wednesdays.
__label__joy	Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
__label__joy	So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
__label__neutral	Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
__label__non-neutral	Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
__label__disgust	Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
__label__neutral	I was shrieking... like a Marine.
__label__neutral	All right here. Watch me execute the three Ps of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.
__label__neutral	She's not much of a phone person.
__label__neutral	Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
__label__non-neutral	Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
__label__neutral	Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
__label__non-neutral	Maybe you should.
__label__non-neutral	Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
__label__neutral	You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
__label__neutral	Oh, that is so not true.
__label__neutral	Oh, it is.
__label__neutral	It isn't.
__label__neutral	It is.
__label__anger	Isn't!
__label__neutral	Okay ladies, that ends todays class, and lets remember, lets be safe out there.
__label__joy	Its a great class.
__label__neutral	Thanks.
__label__neutral	Yeah, yeah, I was watching.
__label__neutral	Umm, hey, a couple of questions though.
__label__non-neutral	Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
__label__neutral	Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them
__label__non-neutral	No. No-no. No. What would
__label__surprise	Who? Me the attacker?
__label__sadness	Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you.
__label__sadness	Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
__label__surprise	No-noReally?!
__label__non-neutral	Of course!
__label__sadness	Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh
__label__sadness	Ohh, Im sorry.
__label__neutral	Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
__label__non-neutral	What?! Anything! Anything!
__label__neutral	Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.
__label__non-neutral	This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
__label__surprise	Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
__label__neutral	Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later.
__label__neutral	Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over here. All right, come on
__label__non-neutral	Hey, you guys. Listen, Im sorry that I was hogging the game beforeOh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
__label__neutral	Theyre all Chandler.
__label__surprise	Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good!
__label__neutral	I did.  But it came at a price.
__label__fear	But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.
__label__surprise	Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!
__label__joy	Sure!
__label__neutral	Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?
__label__joy	With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!
__label__joy	And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!
__label__neutral	Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much.
__label__joy	Well, I like that idea.
__label__joy	Obviously!
__label__neutral	I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow?
__label__neutral	I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like
__label__disgust	No.
__label__non-neutral	Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely."
__label__disgust	Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
__label__surprise	So, thats it?
__label__neutral	I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
__label__neutral	Which is why
__label__anger	What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
__label__non-neutral	I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
__label__non-neutral	Are you mocking me?
__label__neutral	No, Im not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.
__label__joy	Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
__label__joy	Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
__label__neutral	Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but
__label__neutral	Cat.
__label__joy	Yes! You are so smart!  I love you.
__label__joy	I love you too.
__label__non-neutral	I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
__label__surprise	Why?
__label__neutral	I don't know.
__label__joy	This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
__label__neutral	That's
__label__non-neutral	Hey!
__label__neutral	Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has
__label__neutral	But
__label__disgust	No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
__label__neutral	Okay. Okay, but you cant fire him today.
__label__non-neutral	Why not?!
__label__non-neutral	Because Im dumping him today.
__label__surprise	What?! You said he was sweet!
__label__neutral	He
__label__neutral	Just dont pick up your phone.
__label__disgust	Then he comes over!  "Im so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
__label__surprise	What? So now Im not allowed to fire him?
__label__non-neutral	You cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill himself.
__label__neutral	Okay well then, Ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
__label__disgust	Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill
__label__neutral	Okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it!
__label__non-neutral	Okay. But the question is whos gonna go first. Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
__label__non-neutral	Really? Thats the thing Im worse at! Youll see.
__label__neutral	This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
__label__sadness	Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
__label__sadness	Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone?
__label__neutral	Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
__label__neutral	Oh. Well, Ill right you everyday.  15 Yemen Road, Yemen.

__label__neutral	No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
__label__joy	Well, I then guess Im going to Yemen! Im going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
__label__joy	Hi!
__label__neutral	Hey.
__label__neutral	HeyOoh, hows Hilda? Is she working out?
__label__neutral	Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.

__label__neutral	Hello?

__label__neutral	can you excuse me for a minute?
__label__non-neutral	Hey, funny you should call.
__label__neutral	I was just looking over next weeks script.
__label__surprise	Canceled?!
__label__surprise	Like theyre taking it off the air?
__label__neutral	Ohh.
__label__neutral	All right, see you Monday.
__label__surprise	Were not even shootin them anymore?!!
__label__non-neutral	All right, bye!
__label__non-neutral	They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
__label__sadness	Sorry.
__label__sadness	Im sorry Joey.
__label__surprise	Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
__label__neutral	Its so secluded up here.
__label__joy	I know. I like it up here.
__label__non-neutral	I feel like were the only two people in the world.  Oops. Sorry.
__label__non-neutral	Whats the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
__label__fear	No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-Iwould youactually, would you go check on that?
__label__neutral	Honey, we dont have any bears here.

__label__neutral	Diet Coke
__label__non-neutral	What the hell was that?!
__label__neutral	A lesson in the importance of unagi.
__label__neutral	Ohh,
__label__neutral	Perhaps. Now Im curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to
__label__neutral	All right, so we werent
__label__neutral	Im sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but Ilook, I just want you guys to be safe.
__label__neutral	What are you doing?
__label__neutral	Im leaning. This is where I lean.
__label__neutral	Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
__label__fear	Brenda a bee!
__label__surprise	What?
__label__non-neutral	Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
__label__disgust	I think I know whats going on here.
__label__neutral	You do?
__label__disgust	Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its wrong. Youre married.
__label__neutral	I totally understand.  Can I
__label__joy	All right, let's do it!
__label__surprise	No, no, no. What was that?
__label__neutral	I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
__label__non-neutral	Well, people!
__label__neutral	People, people, people.
__label__neutral	Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey.
__label__neutral	Show 'em how it's done.
__label__neutral	Count it off.
__label__neutral	So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
__label__disgust	Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and hes so cheap, hed never fly to London in a million years.
__label__neutral	Yeah, invite him?
__label__neutral	Hey, did I do these neat enough?
__label__neutral	Yeah, theyre fine.
__label__non-neutral	Yeah?
__label__surprise	If anyone asks, well just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
__label__neutral	Sure. Why not?
__label__surprise	Really?
__label__neutral	Yeah?
__label__non-neutral	I dont think Id be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
__label__fear	Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldnt invite her?
__label__non-neutral	Oh, no-no, yknow I absolutely adore Rachel its just that, well it might be a awkward for you.
__label__neutral	But its absolutely your decision.
__label__neutral	More tea?
__label__neutral	Yeah sure.
__label__neutral	Earl Grey?
__label__non-neutral	Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
__label__neutral	Hi.
__label__joy	Hey!
__label__neutral	Hey! So how was the doctor?
__label__joy	Oh, everything went great.
__label__neutral	Good.
__label__neutral	Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
__label__non-neutral	Oh.
__label__neutral	I dont see the baby. Where is it?
__label__non-neutral	Oh no, I know I couldnt see it either at first, but its right umm  Ross, I lost it again.
__label__non-neutral	Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
__label__neutral	Excuse me?
__label__neutral	Could you help me with something?
__label__neutral	The patient Im looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.
__label__neutral	And umm, hes like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
__label__neutral	I think I know who youre talking about.
__label__joy	Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
__label__neutral	Im sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff
__label__neutral	Uh, shes with me.  Dr. Drake Remoray.
__label__neutral	Dr. Drake who?
__label__neutral	Remoray. Its Portuguese. We need that information; Im a doctor.
__label__surprise	A doctor at this hospital?
__label__anger	Damnit woman were losing precious time! Now do you want this mans blood on your head?
__label__neutral	Hands.
__label__neutral	Hands!
__label__neutral	It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in.
__label__neutral	Hes a patient of mine, Ive been treating him for years!
__label__neutral	Hes in room 816.
__label__joy	816, thank you!
__label__neutral	Thank you.
__label__neutral	And what is his name?
__label__surprise	No!
__label__joy	Hi!
__label__joy	Hi!
__label__neutral	Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
__label__non-neutral	Awww.
__label__joy	Thanks a million.
__label__joy	Oh, youre welcome a million.
__label__neutral	Okay, Ill see you in our room.
__label__neutral	Yeah.
__label__surprise	Oh my God.
__label__neutral	I know.
__label__neutral	Okay, I gotta go.
__label__surprise	Whoa! What?! Why?!
__label__sadness	Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
__label__surprise	Here?! Now?!
__label__neutral	Well, yeah.
__label__fear	I cant-I cant stay here all night, and if I go in there shes-shes gonna wanna... do stuff.
__label__surprise	What happened?
__label__sadness	Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago.
__label__joy	Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
__label__anger	Stupid, useless Canadian money!
__label__neutral	Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
__label__surprise	Really?
__label__neutral	Will you call him?
__label__joy	Yes!
__label__joy	I will!
__label__joy	Absolutely!
__label__neutral	(She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other.
__label__neutral	She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in
__label__joy	Oh my God! That is so good!
__label__neutral	Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it.
__label__neutral	Hey!
__label__neutral	Hey!
__label__neutral	What do you got there?
__label__neutral	Oh its umm, its tofu cake. Do you want some?
__label__neutral	What are you doing tonight?
__label__neutral	Huh? Uh
__label__surprise	Dude! Dude!
__label__neutral	Oh!  Sorry. Uh, Ive got those plans with Phoebe, why?
__label__surprise	Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
__label__surprise	What?! Tonight?!
__label__neutral	Thats what Monica said.
__label__surprise	After she gave me that big speech?!
__label__anger	She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?
__label__anger	I think shes trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
__label__neutral	Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
__label__disgust	Who cares? I repel women.
__label__surprise	No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
__label__surprise	What?!
__label__neutral	Its yours!
__label__non-neutral	Yeah well, Im-Im a slut.
__label__neutral	Me too.
__label__joy	Hi Jill!
__label__joy	Hey!
__label__neutral	Hi .
__label__neutral	Rachel.
__label__surprise	Rachel! Well, you-youre not at home, youre-youre-youre right here.
__label__non-neutral	Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But its not!
__label__neutral	Okay. So well Ill umm,  Ill have her home by midnight.
__label__non-neutral	That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
__label__sadness	I'm sorry, man.
__label__neutral	Hey, y'know what you should do?
__label__neutral	You should make something happen for yourself.
__label__neutral	Y'know, like-like write a play.
__label__joy	Write a movie!
__label__neutral	Huh?
__label__neutral	I mean, what about those
__label__sadness	Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
__label__joy	Wait a second, I could star in it!
__label__neutral	Or that.
__label__non-neutral	I can't write!
__label__sadness	Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?
__label__sadness	I can't do it.
__label__neutral	I'll help you.
__label__neutral	Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.
__label__neutral	And plus, it'll give me something to do.
__label__neutral	Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
__label__neutral	Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope thats cool.
__label__neutral	Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
__label__neutral	Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.
__label__neutral	Although, I should probably tell you, shes a porn star.
__label__neutral	Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good.
__label__neutral	All right.
__label__non-neutral	As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
__label__neutral	Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt have to apologize.
__label__neutral	I would really love it if I could do both.
__label__non-neutral	All right, II have to ask.
__label__neutral	What?
__label__fear	Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
__label__surprise	What?!
__label__anger	Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
__label__disgust	A hundred and forty-five pounds.
__label__non-neutral	Yes, yes it is. Its uh  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
__label__non-neutral	Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me?
__label__anger	Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didnt bring you here so you can ambush her.
__label__neutral	Frannie was the one who found your
__label__anger	That bitch!
__label__surprise	Monica! What
__label__anger	Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
__label__neutral	Hi Frannie, congratulations.
__label__anger	You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!
__label__surprise	Why?!
__label__non-neutral	WhatWhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding?
__label__non-neutral	What could I have possibly done?!
__label__anger	Stuart!
__label__neutral	I believe you know my husband.
__label__neutral	So its really a question of
__label__non-neutral	Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
__label__surprise	Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
__label__neutral	Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
__label__surprise	Yeah?
__label__neutral	It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
__label__neutral	What's up?
__label__neutral	Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk.
__label__neutral	Man to uh, me.
__label__neutral	Sure. Okay.
__label__surprise	Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
__label__neutral	Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
__label__neutral	You mean scared.
__label__neutral	No, I mean happy.
__label__joy	Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
__label__sadness	Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in.
__label__surprise	What do you mean, theyre not moving in? They-theyre still moving in right?
__label__neutral	No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
__label__surprise	What?! Over a stupid room!
__label__joy	Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but Im also really psyched cause I dont have to move in here!
__label__joy	Oh no, yeah no, that parts great!
__label__neutral	Yes
__label__surprise	Shut-out!!
__label__surprise	Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
__label__non-neutral	Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
__label__anger	Yeah, get out!
__label__anger	You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!
__label__anger	Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?
__label__anger	Come on, wussies!
__label__neutral	All right, ok, I gotta go.
__label__neutral	I'm going,  and I'm gone.
__label__neutral	One more game?
__label__joy	Oh yeah!
__label__sadness	Im sorry.
__label__sadness	Ohhh. Dont go.
__label__non-neutral	No, I-I-I gotta go.
__label__non-neutral	No. No! No! No!
__label__non-neutral	Honey, honey, people are looking.
__label__anger	I dont care!  I dont care!!
__label__non-neutral	Yeah, um, Im, Im leaving now.
__label__non-neutral	You cant leave! I have your shoe!
__label__non-neutral	Good-bye Chandler Bing.
__label__neutral	Rachel has those in burgendy.
__label__disgust	Oh, ew!
__label__neutral	What?
__label__neutral	Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you.
__label__neutral	Um, can you roll your tongue?
__label__neutral	Because I can, and my Mom couldnt, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
__label__neutral	What, wait, you mean like this?
__label__surprise	Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
__label__neutral	Your not doing it.
__label__neutral	Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I cant. We dont have that....
__label__neutral	Where there is no fear of commitment.
__label__neutral	Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
__label__neutral	Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.
__label__neutral	But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.
__label__fear	It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!
__label__neutral	If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.
__label__neutral	Right.
__label__neutral	In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
__label__non-neutral	Amazingly, that makes sense.
__label__neutral	You think?
__label__joy	Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
__label__fear	Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
__label__joy	Hey!  Hey!
__label__joy	Hi!
__label__joy	Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
__label__joy	Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
__label__neutral	Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
__label__neutral	Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
__label__surprise	Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!
__label__non-neutral	Im missin picture time?!
__label__anger	Yknow she has a face Ross!
__label__non-neutral	Okay. Okay, heres a good one of us.
__label__joy	Wow!
__label__joy	That is a good one!
__label__joy	Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card yknow, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
__label__neutral	Yknow, every year I say Im gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it.
__label__neutral	Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?
__label__surprise	Together? Like-like to people?
__label__joy	Yeah, yknow. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. Itll be cute, okay?
__label__non-neutral	Okay.
__label__neutral	Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?
__label__neutral	Uh sure, sure.
__label__neutral	Bye guys.
__label__non-neutral	I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
__label__non-neutral	You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve got a girlfriend?
__label__neutral	Is this about Mark?
__label__surprise	Oh my God.
__label__neutral	Okay, its not, its not.
__label__non-neutral	Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
__label__neutral	Fine, youre right.
__label__neutral	Lets ah, lets take a break,  lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
__label__non-neutral	No. A break from us.
__label__non-neutral	Bing! Were all set for tonight, 8 oclock.
__label__non-neutral	Oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. Monica has to work.
__label__non-neutral	Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
__label__neutral	Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.
__label__non-neutral	Oh? Why not?
__label__neutral	Its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament.
__label__non-neutral	Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
__label__non-neutral	Well now-now youre just talking crazy.
__label__neutral	So why cant the three of us go out together?
__label__sadness	Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
__label__non-neutral	Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.
__label__joy	And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
__label__anger	Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
__label__neutral	Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this.
__label__joy	Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club.
__label__anger	Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.
__label__neutral	Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.
__label__neutral	It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.
__label__anger	: Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!
__label__neutral	It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
__label__neutral	What are you doing?
__label__neutral	Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy.
__label__neutral	Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.
__label__neutral	There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.
__label__neutral	Did he call?
__label__sadness	No. Sorry.
__label__non-neutral	Why?! Why?! He said hed call. Why hasnt he called?
__label__neutral	Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
__label__non-neutral	Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasnt he called, Rachel? Why?
__label__neutral	Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
__label__surprise	Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
__label__neutral	Well...
__label__non-neutral	The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you?
__label__neutral	No. I...
__label__anger	Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
__label__non-neutral	And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?
__label__non-neutral	I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion!
__label__anger	Is that too much to ask after six years?!
__label__non-neutral	I mean what?
__label__non-neutral	Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!
__label__non-neutral	I mean do we not have as much fun?!
__label__non-neutral	Dont I deserve a few tears?!!
__label__non-neutral	I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
__label__non-neutral	Hey!
__label__anger	I did not cry my eyes out!!
__label__non-neutral	Come on!
__label__sadness	Its like the end of an era!
__label__sadness	No more J-man and Channies!
__label__non-neutral	!
__label__non-neutral	Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
__label__neutral	Do I know why were rushing?
__label__neutral	Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
__label__neutral	Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.
__label__joy	Oh, I found it!
__label__surprise	!
__label__joy	Thats so great for you guys!
__label__joy	Yeah!
__label__neutral	Good luck, with your girlfriend.
__label__joy	Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!
__label__neutral	Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
__label__neutral	Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
__label__neutral	So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
__label__joy	Yes, you can, very much.
__label__surprise	Ahhhh!!
__label__non-neutral	Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
__label__neutral	Do
__label__neutral	Ah,
__label__neutral	Do
__label__neutral	Ah,
__label__non-neutral	DO YOU?
__label__non-neutral	Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was a beautiful speech.
__label__disgust	Oh, come on.
__label__non-neutral	Hey!
__label__joy	All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!
__label__neutral	And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.
__label__neutral	And what you said about Nana.
__label__non-neutral	Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there.
__label__neutral	And you know what?
__label__neutral	I think she was.
__label__surprise	Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
__label__neutral	You forget how many great songs Heart had.
__label__neutral	Yeah.
__label__neutral	You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
__label__non-neutral	So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
__label__neutral	Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but Im not even sure I got it.
__label__neutral	What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey.
__label__neutral	And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.
__label__non-neutral	You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
__label__neutral	Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
__label__anger	I cant find garbage bags!
__label__neutral	Oh, I think I saw some in here.
__label__surprise	What is it?!
__label__disgust	I dont know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itll die.
__label__non-neutral	I cant believe were living here!
__label__surprise	You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really  proposing?
__label__non-neutral	No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.
__label__surprise	Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it  look like?!
__label__non-neutral	I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of  it.
__label__non-neutral	Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
__label__sadness	Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don't want to hurt her.
__label__neutral	Okay, look, just do it gently.
__label__neutral	You're right.
__label__neutral	You're right.
__label__neutral	I-I'll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I'll be gentle.
__label__neutral	I can do that.
__label__neutral	I am a gentle person.
__label__neutral	Oh, by the  way.
__label__neutral	Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.
__label__neutral	Hi, Pheebs?
__label__neutral	Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
__label__non-neutral	What?!
__label__non-neutral	Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England.
__label__neutral	Which
__label__neutral	How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
__label__neutral	Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
__label__neutral	Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
__label__joy	Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which
__label__joy	Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here
__label__anger	You completely stole my answer!
__label__non-neutral	Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
__label__anger	Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
__label__neutral	What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
__label__neutral	I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
__label__neutral	Would ya care to venture one?
__label__neutral	Would
__label__anger	Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
__label__neutral	Are you just repeating what
__label__neutral	All right, let's move on.
__label__neutral	Okay then.
__label__neutral	All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.
__label__neutral	And-and when she comes in hopefully, she wont recognise you because, well, why would she?
__label__neutral	Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.
__label__neutral	You be Mr. Gonzalez, and Ill be uh, Mr. Wong.
__label__neutral	Diverse.

__label__non-neutral	There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
__label__surprise	Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
__label__anger	We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
__label__surprise	Okay, who are you?
__label__non-neutral	The Hardy boys?
__label__anger	Look, I dont need to steal some stupid ring, all right?
__label__anger	I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
__label__neutral	Marry me.
__label__surprise	Oh my God! Joey!
__label__joy	Hell yeah! Ill marry you!
__label__anger	You cant marry him!

__label__surprise	Phoebe!
__label__surprise	Why?! Why cant she marry me?!
__label__non-neutral	I can and I will!
__label__neutral	Shes not pregnant. Its Rachel. Rachels the one whos pregnant.
__label__surprise	Oh my God.
__label__non-neutral	Hey!
__label__non-neutral	Phoebe I think he would notice if you didnt have a baby in nine months!
__label__surprise	Its Joey!
__label__surprise	Now I cant believe it! What? Rachels pregnant?  Whos the father?
__label__neutral	We dont know.
__label__neutral	Ohh I wonder if that dude.

__label__neutral	Yeah.
__label__surprise	Who? Who is it?
__label__disgust	About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didnt see who it was but
__label__neutral	Was that story over?
__label__neutral	The guy left this.
__label__surprise	Oh my God! I know who the father is
__label__non-neutral	People have got to finish their stories!
__label__surprise	Oh my God, youre back!
__label__surprise	Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!

__label__disgust	Eww! Oh, its all dirty. You should throw this out.
__label__anger	No!
__label__non-neutral	Me too!

__label__anger	They are completely differentOkay!
__label__surprise	Okay!
__label__surprise	Okay!

__label__non-neutral	I will!
__label__neutral	I-I am going to
__label__neutral	Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
__label__neutral	No.  And then I called him, and he wasnt there.
__label__neutral	Well, then hes, hes probably just, out.
__label__non-neutral	Oh, thank you thats very helpful, Im glad you came over.
__label__neutral	Hello.
__label__non-neutral	Hi! Its me.
__label__joy	Hi! Oh, Im so glad you called.
__label__non-neutral	Really? Ive been thinking, this is crazy, I mean dont, dont you think we can work on this?
__label__neutral	Hey, what do you want to drink?
__label__surprise	Whos that?
__label__neutral	Nobody.
__label__neutral	Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
__label__neutral	Is that Mark?
__label__neutral	Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
__label__non-neutral	Yeah! Got it!
__label__non-neutral	Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
__label__non-neutral	Ah, thats okay, thanks.
__label__neutral	Hey, you dont have to smile. You just have to dance.
__label__non-neutral	Look, I dont feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
__label__neutral	Oh, okay.  Hey, two beers.
__label__neutral	You wanna go in the bedroom? Its a little more comfortable.
__label__neutral	Sure.
__label__surprise	Okay.  Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
__label__surprise	If this is your idea of sexy talk?
__label__non-neutral	No seriously, yknow the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
__label__neutral	What contracts?
__label__non-neutral	Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I dont get.
__label__neutral	Like what?
__label__disgust	Yknow, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?
__label__anger	Tag!
__label__anger	Im serious!
__label__anger	This isnt funny!
__label__anger	Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
__label__surprise	Rach, Im sorry, but you didnt give me any contracts!
__label__anger	Yes I did! And I put a little
__label__neutral	Im telling you, you never gave them to me.
__label__anger	Yknow what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
__label__non-neutral	No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are
__label__disgust	Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
__label__neutral	You wanna go down to the office right now?
__label__anger	No! Come on its late, were not gonna go down to the office.
__label__neutral	Okay I understand.  I wouldnt want to be proved wrong either.
__label__joy	Okay get your coat!  Oh! When did you unhook this?  Nice work!
__label__neutral	Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this    is my good friend Ross.
__label__neutral	Nice to meet you.
__label__neutral	Oh and I need to talk to you.
__label__neutral	About what?
__label__neutral	To see if know what these guys are talking about.
__label__neutral	Pheebs, hows it going?
__label__neutral	Im doing okay. I think its going well. Do you think theyre having fun? Am I talking to fast?
__label__joy	Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, its going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
__label__neutral	Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before?
__label__neutral	Oh right, Coach Ruben.
__label__neutral	Do you know what Pheebs?
__label__fear	When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
__label__neutral	Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
__label__neutral	See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
__label__surprise	What do you mean?
__label__anger	Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
__label__anger	Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
__label__surprise	Uh, what was that?
__label__neutral	Uh,
__label__neutral	...I'm, I'm okay.
__label__neutral	That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
__label__neutral	Okay.
__label__neutral	Bye.
__label__joy	Whoo-hoo!
__label__joy	Yeah, there you go!
__label__joy	Second date!
__label__neutral	...I dunno.
__label__neutral	You
__label__non-neutral	Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay?
__label__disgust	I mean,... how needy is that?
__label__neutral	Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
__label__joy	You're so pretty.
__label__joy	Hi!
__label__neutral	Hey, Phoebe.
__label__neutral	Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
__label__surprise	You talked to him. Are you crazy?
__label__joy	Thank you, Happy Holidays.
__label__anger	Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't  Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
__label__non-neutral	Hey!!
__label__fear	The charity's on fire!
__label__fear	Help!
__label__joy	Oh good!
__label__joy	Thank you, I need that.
__label__surprise	Whoa!
__label__surprise	What is that?!
__label__surprise	It's nine o'clock in the morning!
__label__neutral	Can I help you?
__label__neutral	Uh yeah, where-wheres the guy who decides whos pictures go up on the wall?
__label__neutral	Hes not here right now.
__label__anger	Oh, youre kidding me!
__label__neutral	All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes.
__label__neutral	Okay?
__label__neutral	Im an actor; Im kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
__label__neutral	Yknow, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
__label__neutral	Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  Youre the other one right?
__label__non-neutral	Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
__label__surprise	What?! Youre crazy! Theres nothing sexual about the noises I make!
__label__surprise	Really?
__label__non-neutral	Theres nothing sexual about this?
__label__non-neutral	Oooh.
__label__non-neutral	Oo God!
__label__non-neutral	Ohh.
__label__non-neutral	Ohhhh.
__label__non-neutral	Ohh.
__label__non-neutral	What are you looking at?!
__label__neutral	I mean hi.
__label__non-neutral	Oh myThis is so embarrassing. Oh my God, Im never gonna get massaged again!
__label__non-neutral	No, you cant let this stop you from getting massages!
__label__neutral	No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
__label__surprise	Really?!
__label__neutral	Well not clients, lovers. But lets just yknow, try it again. Come back and-and well work through it.
__label__surprise	Are you sure?
__label__neutral	Yes.
__label__neutral	I guess.
__label__joy	Great! Okay, if youll just excuse me.  So, did you hear something you liked?
__label__non-neutral	Noo!!!
__label__non-neutral	Yes!
__label__non-neutral	Noo!!
__label__non-neutral	Yes!!
__label__fear	Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk!  That they know of.
__label__neutral	Okay, heres the thing. Were gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that youre drunk.
__label__non-neutral	Really?! You promise?
__label__neutral	Yeah, Ill take care of it.
__label__joy	Okay. I love you so much.
__label__neutral	Okay we have to do something about your breath.
__label__surprise	What about
__label__neutral	Thats still yours. Okay, now remember its a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
__label__neutral	Okay. I can do that.
__label__neutral	Okay.
__label__surprise	Surprise!!!
__label__neutral	Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.
__label__neutral	Yeah, were done.
__label__surprise	Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
__label__joy	Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
__label__surprise	Really?!
__label__neutral	No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
__label__joy	Sweet!
__label__neutral	All right, well finish your coffee; lets go.
__label__disgust	Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
__label__neutral	Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight.
__label__non-neutral	I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
__label__sadness	Im sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby
__label__neutral	So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
__label__non-neutral	Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.
__label__neutral	Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
__label__joy	She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
__label__joy	Oh, what a fun office.
__label__neutral	I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.
__label__neutral	So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
__label__neutral	Rachel? Do you smoke?
__label__neutral	Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror storiesabout ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
__label__neutral	What?
__label__neutral	Peach pit.
__label__neutral	Yes, Bunny?
__label__neutral	Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
__label__neutral	-Peaches?
__label__neutral	Actually, nectarines, but basically...
__label__neutral	Could've been a peach.
__label__neutral	Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.
__label__non-neutral	Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!  What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
__label__joy	All right!
__label__joy	Westminster Abbey!
__label__joy	Hands down, best Abbey Ive ever seen.
__label__joy	Hey!
__label__neutral	Okay.
__label__neutral	What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
__label__neutral	I think its great. Its great. Yknow, theyre thinking of changing the name of this place.
__label__surprise	Really? To what?
__label__non-neutral	To Put the Camera Away!!!
__label__neutral	Man,
__label__surprise	Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And
__label__neutral	Chandler, theres a guy right over there.
__label__surprise	Thats a mailman! Thats
__label__neutral	Chandler, dont worry! This doesnt make you any less of a guy!
__label__neutral	Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
__label__neutral	Hmm.
__label__non-neutral	Eh..., I dont, I dont know.
__label__neutral	What?
__label__non-neutral	Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
__label__neutral	Rachel?
__label__neutral	Yeah.
__label__neutral	Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
__label__non-neutral	Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
__label__neutral	Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
__label__non-neutral	Eh, do you believe that?
__label__neutral	Yeah?
__label__non-neutral	Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
__label__neutral	No, you said the baby creeps you out.
__label__non-neutral	No, the little girl creeps me out.
__label__neutral	You said the baby.
__label__non-neutral	Why would the baby creep me out?
__label__non-neutral	Why would the little girl creep you out?
__label__neutral	You guys, Im sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
__label__surprise	This is going in your book?
__label__joy	Yeah, its about relationships. Yknow? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
__label__surprise	What?! Excuse me!
__label__neutral	And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.
__label__neutral	And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as its a compliment.
__label__joy	Yeah!!!!
__label__joy	Yes, I made it!
__label__joy	Im on time!
__label__neutral	Okay, why dont we all uh,  open our books to page 23.
__label__neutral	Where  Where you will seea uha bunch of uhred spots.
__label__neutral	Okay,  umm, why dont, why dont you all start to read, while I
__label__non-neutral	Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
__label__non-neutral	Ross! What are you I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
__label__neutral	Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
__label__surprise	What the? What
__label__non-neutral	Hi!
__label__neutral	Miss? May I help you?
__label__non-neutral	Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay?
__label__neutral	But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.
__label__sadness	So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
__label__neutral	It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
__label__neutral	Do you want me to be afraid of you?
__label__neutral	Of course not.
__label__joy	I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.
__label__non-neutral	I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
__label__surprise	Really?
__label__neutral	Of course!
__label__non-neutral	Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
__label__neutral	All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit
__label__anger	Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is
__label__disgust	A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
__label__non-neutral	Ooh, it's not a toy.
__label__sadness	Well, I don't know what else to do.
__label__non-neutral	I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!
__label__non-neutral	So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!
__label__non-neutral	'Cause I-I got nothing!
__label__non-neutral	All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.
__label__neutral	Okay then.
__label__neutral	Here we go.
__label__non-neutral	Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?
__label__neutral	Ask again later.
__label__anger	Later is not good enough.
__label__neutral	Ask again later.
__label__anger	What the hell!
__label__anger	This is broken!
__label__anger	It-it is broken!
__label__neutral	All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
__label__neutral	Excuse me.
__label__neutral	Yeah?
__label__neutral	Are you Phoebe Buffay?
__label__neutral	Yeah.
__label__joy	Can-can I get your autograph, Im your biggest fan.
__label__neutral	I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
__label__joy	Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
__label__non-neutral	No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
__label__neutral	Come on, two on one.
__label__surprise	What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
__label__surprise	What, now?
__label__joy	Yes, now is when you swoop!
__label__joy	You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not!
__label__non-neutral	You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
__label__neutral	My Catholic friend is right.
__label__neutral	She's distraught.
__label__neutral	You're there for her.
__label__joy	You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
__label__neutral	Well, I just called Joshua
__label__non-neutral	Oh, how did it go?
__label__neutral	Well, I did my best to convince him that Im not some crazy girl who is dying to get marriedIm just going through a hard time.
__label__neutral	What did he say?
__label__non-neutral	Well uh, his answering machine was
__label__non-neutral	Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that hes gonna call you again.
__label__sadness	Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care.
__label__sadness	I dont think hes the one Im sad about.
__label__sadness	Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well.
__label__sadness	Yeah, maybe.
__label__sadness	And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
__label__non-neutral	Any luck?
__label__sadness	Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?
__label__sadness	I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
__label__non-neutral	Again. Yknow what? I think we all did.
__label__non-neutral	Hey!
__label__surprise	I dont get it!
__label__non-neutral	It was in my room all night!
__label__non-neutral	And if she didnt take it, and I didnt take it; and you  didnt take it, then who did?
__label__anger	Shh!
__label__anger	Were trying to think!
__label__neutral	This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
__label__surprise	What?!
__label__joy	Oh yeah!
__label__neutral	I got in there myself once.
__label__neutral	My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldnt, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.
__label__neutral	Yeah.
__label__non-neutral	It was funny til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
__label__neutral	No, you, you cant fit in that thing. Thats not deep enough.
__label__non-neutral	Oh yeah?  If I cant, Ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
__label__neutral	All right, you have yourself a deal.
__label__surprise	Okay.  See?! I told ya!
__label__non-neutral	Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
__label__neutral	Hey! Whats up?
__label__non-neutral	Hey!
__label__joy	Hey-hey, whos your friend?  Hey!!
__label__joy	Hey Joey!
__label__joy	Erin! Still here!
__label__joy	Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
__label__joy	Why wouldnt ya? Erin is great! Then-then theres you guys.
__label__joy	Ohh, listen. Ive got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
__label__non-neutral	I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
__label__neutral	Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just
__label__surprise	Really?!
__label__surprise	Ohh!
__label__neutral	Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
__label__surprise	Really?!
__label__joy	Yeah!
__label__neutral	I mean you definitely should do that.
__label__joy	Y'know what, I should do it.
__label__joy	Yeah!
__label__joy	Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
__label__neutral	Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
__label__neutral	All right.
__label__non-neutral	Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
__label__anger	This woman's living my life.
__label__surprise	What?
__label__anger	She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!
__label__non-neutral	Look at this, look.
__label__non-neutral	She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.
__label__non-neutral	She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.
__label__non-neutral	She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
__label__neutral	You're not an artist.
__label__non-neutral	Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
__label__surprise	I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
__label__non-neutral	No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
__label__neutral	I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
__label__non-neutral	Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
__label__surprise	I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
__label__disgust	Oh, that is so sick.
__label__disgust	I feel violated. And not in a good way.
__label__surprise	How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
__label__joy	Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
__label__non-neutral	Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
__label__non-neutral	I know. My arm is killing me.
__label__neutral	No, I meant with the dropper over here.
__label__anger	Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm
__label__neutral	Hey Rach, can you pass me the
__label__neutral	Yep!
__label__joy	Go!!
__label__surprise	What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral	Okay! Okay! Okay!  We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
__label__surprise	Oh!
__label__joy	Hey!
__label__joy	Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
__label__joy	Oh, thanks, thanks.
__label__neutral	So Monica tells me that uh, you dont want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent.
__label__neutral	Is that true?
__label__neutral	Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
__label__neutral	Pheebs
__label__non-neutral	Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
__label__non-neutral	What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
__label__neutral	Hey.
__label__neutral	I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here.
__label__neutral	Whats the matter?
__label__neutral	Nothing.
__label__non-neutral	What is it? Hey!
__label__sadness	Really its nothing. Im just
__label__neutral	Rach come on, what?
__label__sadness	Ive just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
__label__surprise	What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
__label__sadness	Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
__label__neutral	Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
__label__sadness	Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right?
__label__neutral	Yeah, I guess so.
__label__sadness	I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
__label__surprise	Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?!
__label__joy	I just found out this is Chandlers office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!
__label__non-neutral	Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
__label__anger	We said seven!
__label__anger	We said six!
__label__neutral	The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.
__label__anger	Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!"
__label__joy	Hi!
__label__disgust	Oh my good God.
__label__disgust	Ugh!
__label__non-neutral	I know what time you said.
__label__surprise	What?!
__label__neutral	Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
__label__anger	You, get out of my shop!
__label__surprise	Well, what did he do?
__label__anger	He went out with my wife!
__label__surprise	Joey!
__label__non-neutral	Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-IHey! I did
__label__anger	Thats my wife!!! Get out!
__label__neutral	Well, we should go.
__label__neutral	Yeah.
__label__neutral	Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport.
__label__neutral	Oh please.
__label__non-neutral	Every moment is precious.
__label__neutral	Yknow?
__label__non-neutral	Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.
__label__neutral	Well, were really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
__label__non-neutral	On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane.
__label__non-neutral	No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.
__label__neutral	Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
__label__neutral	Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
__label__neutral	So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.
__label__neutral	We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
__label__joy	Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.
__label__surprise	Yeah?
__label__joy	Yeah!
__label__neutral	Just go for it Chandler.
__label__neutral	Yeah, you should.
__label__neutral	Yeah, you should, really.
__label__neutral	Go on.
__label__neutral	All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. But Im just doing it for you guys.
__label__non-neutral	: Im sure as hell a dancer, its no use Marge will never go for me.
__label__non-neutral	Come on Treeger, dont say that.
__label__neutral	You just ahh, you just need more practice.
__label__neutral	Here, come on, lets ahh, lets try it again.
__label__neutral	Come on.
__label__non-neutral	Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.
__label__non-neutral	I mean, yknow, Im not really that comfortable dancing with a We-he!!
__label__non-neutral	Hey!
__label__non-neutral	: Yeah!
__label__neutral	Oh, I
__label__neutral	Are you sure? Ill bet theres another flight to Minsk in like
__label__neutral	July. Umm,
__label__non-neutral	Thats really beautiful. What does it mean?
__label__neutral	Please, clean my beakers. I dont get out of the lab much.
__label__non-neutral	Thats good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
__label__neutral	Yeah, I Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldnt because yknow, Ihave to leave.
__label__non-neutral	Youre right! Youre right. Dont say it.
__label__non-neutral	I-I do though.
__label__non-neutral	I do too.
__label__neutral	Bye Phoebe.
__label__non-neutral	Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
__label__neutral	I know.
__label__surprise	Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that?
__label__non-neutral	Listen, Im gettin something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
__label__neutral	No, I do not hear that.
__label__joy	Yeah, I-I heard.  I think its great!  Ohh, Im so happy for you!
__label__joy	Oh, well, thats great!
__label__joy	Yeah! Yeah!
__label__joy	I cant believe youre getting married!
__label__neutral	Yeah.
__label__neutral	Monica and Rachel made out.
__label__surprise	Ohhh!
__label__surprise	Why are we in bed together?
__label__neutral	I dont know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
__label__neutral	Yeah.
__label__surprise	Really?!
__label__neutral	No!
__label__fear	But we-we didnt havesex-uh, did we?
__label__neutral	I mean, I dont remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
__label__joy	Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
__label__neutral	And we didnt have sex.
__label__neutral	Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. Im just glad we didnt do anything stupid.
__label__neutral	Tell me about it.
__label__neutral	What are we gonna do?
__label__neutral	I say we go with
__label__neutral	Chandler?
__label__neutral	Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
__label__non-neutral	Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
__label__disgust	Whats that smell?
__label__non-neutral	I know!
__label__neutral	Hi, remember us?
__label__neutral	Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a
__label__neutral	I am. I'm
__label__neutral	Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
__label__sadness	Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
__label__neutral	Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
__label__neutral	Yknow what? It
__label__neutral	Sorry.
__label__joy	Im so exited!
__label__joy	Ive been waiting for this for months!
__label__joy	I got my hair coloured!
__label__joy	I got new sheets!
__label__joy	Im making him a
__label__neutral	Um-hmm.
__label__neutral	What am I making him by the way?
__label__neutral	Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
__label__surprise	I thought I was making him filet mignon?
__label__neutral	Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.
__label__non-neutral	And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
__label__surprise	Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
__label__non-neutral	Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!
__label__non-neutral	Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated.
__label__neutral	Yknow its like uh, Biology!
__label__non-neutral	Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
__label__neutral	Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.
__label__non-neutral	Phoebe!
__label__neutral	If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes probably not gay.
__label__neutral	You are falling fast asleep.
__label__neutral	Deeper.
__label__neutral	Deeper.
__label__neutral	Deeper.
__label__neutral	You are now completely asleep.
__label__neutral	You dont need to smoke.
__label__neutral	Cigarettes dont control you.
__label__neutral	You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
__label__neutral	A strong, confident woman.
__label__neutral	Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller.
__label__joy	Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
__label__neutral	Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
__label__non-neutral	Of course not.
__label__neutral	No.
__label__neutral	Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
__label__neutral	So how are things going with Paul?
__label__joy	Good.
__label__non-neutral	Although yknow, he-hes a private guy.
__label__sadness	Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
__label__neutral	Thats easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wont open.
__label__surprise	So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
__label__neutral	No thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
__label__neutral	Hi honey.
__label__joy	Hi!
__label__fear	Okay, Ben, I wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident.
__label__surprise	Monica, number one, I dont think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!
__label__neutral	You said number two.
__label__neutral	I also said number one.
__label__neutral	Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
__label__neutral	Cant I just look at the handles on them?
__label__neutral	You would think.
__label__neutral	Okay, fine.
__label__non-neutral	Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why Im a terrible waitress?
__label__neutral	Because, I dont care.
__label__neutral	I dont care.
__label__non-neutral	I dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I dont care where the tray spot is, I just dont care, this is not what I want to do.
__label__non-neutral	So I dont think I should do it anymore.
__label__non-neutral	Im gonna give you my weeks notice.
__label__surprise	What?!
__label__non-neutral	Gunther, I quit.
__label__surprise	Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee?
__label__non-neutral	Ohh, I mean its just so realistic!
__label__neutral	I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.
__label__joy	Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
__label__neutral	Do you uh, do youready for a refill?
__label__surprise	Oh, I probably shouldntso I will!  Oh! Wow! Its like its raining!
__label__joy	Pretty cool, huh?
__label__neutral	But if youre thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldnt get sucked up into the mechanism, well youd be wrong.
__label__neutral	Umm, can I use your bathroom?
__label__neutral	Its uh, right through there.
__label__non-neutral	Okay.  God yknow, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbianis apartment
__label__joy	Yeah, lifes pretty great isnt it?
__label__joy	Yeah, it sure is!
__label__neutral	You know, I think I was sixteen.
__label__neutral	Please, just a little bit off the back.
__label__neutral	I'm still on "no."
__label__neutral	Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
__label__anger	No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.
__label__neutral	What's goin' on?
__label__neutral	Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
__label__non-neutral	What stupid thing did you do?
__label__disgust	Ewww!
__label__neutral	I know.
__label__neutral	See, yes.
__label__neutral	Thats Yasmine Bleeth, shes a completely different kind of chick.
__label__neutral	I love you both.
__label__neutral	But in very different ways.
__label__surprise	Hey!
__label__surprise	Hey!
__label__neutral	(sees hes watching
__label__non-neutral	I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
__label__non-neutral	If they cant find a home for her, they kill her! And Im not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
__label__non-neutral	Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
__label__disgust	Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of other animals!
__label__disgust	Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
__label__joy	Thanks, Im glad you see it that way.
__label__joy	Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
__label__neutral	So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
__label__non-neutral	Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
__label__neutral	So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
__label__neutral	Ohh, he's really shy. I-I dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
__label__neutral	Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
__label__non-neutral	I dont care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
__label__surprise	Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?
__label__neutral	I might've said that.  Why is that funny?
__label__joy	Because I'm very happy for him!  And
__label__non-neutral	Hi!
__label__neutral	All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
__label__neutral	Okay.
__label__neutral	All right, let's go say good-bye.
__label__neutral	Hey!
__label__anger	Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?
__label__disgust	Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
__label__surprise	Fish!
__label__neutral	It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
__label__sadness	Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here
__label__joy	Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
__label__joy	We did have fun, didn't we?
__label__joy	We did!
__label__neutral	Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
__label__joy	Oh, I would love to!
__label__joy	Yay, okay!
__label__joy	Good, good, good, good, good.
__label__neutral	Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
__label__neutral	Um...  Done!
__label__surprise	Youre, hey, youre not paying for the pizza!
__label__neutral	Oh come on, its only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
__label__neutral	Ahh, Id throw another thousand on that.
__label__neutral	Why, how much is that?
__label__neutral	Thats about 60 cents.
__label__neutral	Okay, its coffee.
__label__surprise	Ice coffee? Tell me its ice coffee!
__label__neutral	Its-its hot
__label__surprise	Hot coffee!!!
__label__anger	You idiot!!
__label__anger	You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!
__label__anger	What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?!
__label__non-neutral	Huh?
__label__anger	!
__label__neutral	Whats your favourite thing about summertime?
__label__neutral	Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
__label__neutral	Yeah
__label__surprise	Hey!
__label__joy	Tommyyyy! Say, whats your favourite thing about summer?
__label__neutral	Ooh, I dont know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
__label__non-neutral	Ohh, thats a good one.
__label__neutral	OK, try this salmon mousse.
__label__joy	Mmmm. Good.
__label__neutral	Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
__label__non-neutral	It's creamier.
__label__neutral	Yeah, well, is that
__label__disgust	I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
__label__surprise	My God! What happened to you?
__label__disgust	Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?
__label__non-neutral	"You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
__label__joy	That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
__label__non-neutral	Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really
__label__non-neutral	Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
__label__joy	Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
__label__neutral	Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
__label__neutral	I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
__label__non-neutral	Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
__label__neutral	Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
__label__neutral	I don't see why not.
__label__neutral	Here's my retainer!
__label__neutral	Someone in there?
__label__non-neutral	No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.
__label__surprise	Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
__label__neutral	Someone was in the lady's room, I couldnt wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
__label__neutral	Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, Im-Im talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name.
__label__neutral	Ginger.
__label__neutral	Ginger. Im talking to Ginger, so....
__label__neutral	Dont you have to use the bathroom?
__label__neutral	Nope, nope, Id just ah, Id rather talk to you.
__label__neutral	Yes, I do.
__label__neutral	Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
__label__neutral	Someone in here.
__label__anger	Im going to keep dating him Mother, and theres nothing you can do about it!
__label__anger	Oh yes there is!
__label__anger	What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
__label__anger	That was an accident! And so were you.
__label__anger	Well, at least Im not a murderer!
__label__non-neutral	Oh, my baby!
__label__surprise	That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
__label__neutral	Oh, just years of experience.
__label__non-neutral	Can I get some ice here?!
__label__joy	Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
__label__non-neutral	Youre not the fan whos dying are you?
__label__surprise	Say what?
__label__neutral	Im supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying, but thats not supposed to be until  later!
__label__non-neutral	No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-Im the guy in the coma!
__label__surprise	Oh that was a real person?!
__label__non-neutral	An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
__label__surprise	I-I-Im leaving the show?
__label__neutral	I dont know. Why? Did you hear something?
__label__surprise	Who told you that?
__label__non-neutral	Oh uh, one of the writers.
__label__surprise	Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
__label__neutral	Umm
__label__neutral	Feel better?
__label__joy	Yeah!
__label__joy	Much!
__label__non-neutral	Listen uh, not that Im yknow insecure about my manhood or anything yknow, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
__label__neutral	Yeah, I understand.
__label__joy	Yeah! Okay!  Hey! Hi!
__label__joy	Hi!
__label__surprise	Yknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
__label__neutral	I dont think so.
__label__non-neutral	Oh! Maybe its because Im on television. Im an actor on
__label__surprise	Wow!
__label__neutral	Yeah.
__label__surprise	Really?!
__label__neutral	Hm-mmm.
__label__neutral	$4.50 please.
__label__neutral	Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.
__label__neutral	Alright, alright, alright.
__label__non-neutral	It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word.
__label__non-neutral	Oh God, do something.
__label__non-neutral	Just make contact, smile!
__label__joy	There you go!
__label__non-neutral	You're definitely scaring here.
__label__neutral	Would you like to call somebody?
__label__neutral	Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.
__label__anger	Okay! Feel free to look, but Im telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
__label__neutral	Oh
__label__neutral	Its my sister.
__label__neutral	Okay, very cute braces. Anyway yknow what, the
__label__non-neutral	So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
__label__neutral	In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a
__label__neutral	Phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, she doesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know that youve been living with your Grandmothers for a week now.
__label__neutral	Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
__label__neutral	Hey.
__label__neutral	Hey.
__label__sadness	Im never gonna find a roommate, ever.
__label__neutral	Why, nobody good?
__label__disgust	Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural.
__label__disgust	The spitter.
__label__non-neutral	Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.
__label__neutral	Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing
__label__neutral	So how many more do you have tomorrow?
__label__neutral	Two.
__label__neutral	This photographer, who seemed really dull.
__label__neutral	And this actor guy, who Im not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone Chandler Bing, he said Whoa-whoa, short message.
__label__neutral	Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
__label__non-neutral	Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
__label__neutral	What?
__label__neutral	I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
__label__neutral	Umm, hows it going with you guys?
__label__neutral	Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
__label__surprise	Oh, really?
__label__joy	Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesnt really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think its gonna make a difference
__label__neutral	Hey!
__label__neutral	Hi!
__label__non-neutral	What-what are-what are these?
__label__joy	Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought theyd brighten up the place. They do dont you think?
__label__non-neutral	No-no-no, no!
__label__neutral	Well, how-how come?
__label__neutral	Thats just the way it is.
__label__surprise	Thats crazy.
__label__neutral	Maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.
__label__neutral	See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now Peter!
__label__neutral	Hey, Peter!
__label__neutral	Its me Rhonda!
__label__neutral	From PS-129!
__label__non-neutral	I shared my puddin which you man!
__label__neutral	I gave you my
__label__neutral	I-I think everybodys pretending they dont hear you.
__label__neutral	Anyway, look, I dont know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, Im telling you, he
__label__neutral	Thats okay, Im cool over here. Ill catch up with you later, Joey.
__label__neutral	Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.
__label__neutral	Hows that coffee comin, dear?
__label__neutral	Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
__label__neutral	Im not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
__label__non-neutral	I know!
__label__surprise	Ill bet your thinking, Whats an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee? Eh?
__label__neutral	Op.
__label__non-neutral	Eh.
__label__neutral	Oh, you got me.
__label__neutral	Well, dont think I havent noticed your potential.
__label__neutral	Well, Ive got a project for you thats a lot more related to fashion.
__label__neutral	How does that sound?
__label__joy	Oh, that sounds great.
__label__neutral	Come on over here, sweetheart.
__label__joy	Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
__label__fear	Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe youd want to get back together?
__label__neutral	No. But thanks.
__label__sadness	Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
__label__neutral	Okay. No. But thanks.
__label__neutral	Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
__label__surprise	Wow, that was kinda brutal.
__label__neutral	Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.
__label__neutral	Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, yknow.
__label__neutral	Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,
__label__neutral	Yeah, sure.
__label__surprise	Wow.
__label__neutral	I'm, I'm really sorry.
__label__neutral	Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
__label__surprise	Relieved?
__label__neutral	Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
__label__neutral	She wants
__label__anger	Oh my God! If you say that one more time,
__label__anger	Fine!
__label__anger	Fine!
__label__anger	But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  If you accept full responsibility...  Full responsibility!
__label__anger	...I can begin to trust you again.
__label__anger	Does that seem like something you can do.
__label__anger	Does it?!
__label__anger	!
__label__surprise	No?
__label__neutral	Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel.
__label__neutral	If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
__label__sadness	Yeah, I know.
__label__sadness	I mean, no, youre right.
__label__neutral	Yeah I guess Ill let it go.
__label__sadness	But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
__label__neutral	Sure, its hard to forget!
__label__neutral	But that doesnt mean you have to talk about it!
__label__neutral	A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.
__label__surprise	What the hell happened on that beach?!
__label__neutral	Its between us and the sea, Ross!
__label__non-neutral	I didnt think you were gay. I do now.
__label__neutral	See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
__label__sadness	Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious.
__label__neutral	Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
__label__surprise	Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
__label__neutral	Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
__label__joy	Oh wow! Im free for her!
__label__surprise	Oh, wait a second! I didnt say I wasnt free!
__label__neutral	Hey, Chandler, why dont we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
__label__neutral	Hold on, yknow I
__label__non-neutral	Oh well, thats uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
__label__neutral	Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
__label__neutral	Well, I dont really know what that is, but
__label__neutral	Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
__label__neutral	Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
__label__disgust	Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
__label__surprise	What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
__label__neutral	What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
__label__anger	Joey, get out of the fridge.
__label__non-neutral	All right, all right.
__label__surprise	What is that?
__label__neutral	For the ride.
__label__neutral	Yeah, like in a cab...
__label__neutral	Save it.
__label__disgust	Okay, hating this.
__label__neutral	Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
__label__joy	I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
__label__disgust	That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
__label__non-neutral	All right, I'm going. I'm going.
__label__neutral	Here we go, here we go.
__label__neutral	Rossy, Rossy.
__label__non-neutral	WHAT IS IT?!
__label__non-neutral	Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
__label__neutral	Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
__label__neutral	Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
__label__non-neutral	Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
__label__surprise	Oh my God! Calling from Rome!
__label__neutral	So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
__label__non-neutral	Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome.  I'm talking to Rome.
__label__non-neutral	Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
__label__non-neutral	So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
__label__non-neutral	Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
__label__neutral	Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
__label__surprise	You know it?
__label__neutral	Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
__label__neutral	Oh, sure, they love us over there.
__label__joy	Ben! Ben! Ben!
__label__anger	Gimme em!
__label__anger	No! They are mine!
__label__anger	You stole them from me!
__label__anger	You stole them from me!!
__label__anger	Gimme them!
__label__neutral	You just wanna each take one?
__label__neutral	Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
__label__non-neutral	Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
__label__neutral	Well
__label__neutral	Why dont you phase it out?
__label__non-neutral	Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think youre, yknow, that youre adjusting to life in America.
__label__neutral	Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean theyre probably not even listening!
__label__surprise	Theyre not listening too me?
__label__neutral	Of course theyre listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
__label__non-neutral	Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
__label__neutral	I think you look fine.
__label__neutral	How about Joey... Pepponi?
__label__neutral	No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
__label__neutral	Joey... Switzerland?
__label__neutral	Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.
__label__non-neutral	Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.
__label__neutral	Which I'm not.
__label__non-neutral	Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
__label__neutral	Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
__label__neutral	Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
__label__non-neutral	Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
__label__neutral	Might wanna try Joseph.
__label__non-neutral	Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
__label__joy	Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
__label__surprise	Are you kidding?
__label__neutral	Okay, look.
__label__non-neutral	I-I studied evolution.
__label__non-neutral	Remember, evolution?
__label__non-neutral	Monkey into man?
__label__neutral	Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey.
__label__non-neutral	Im Doctor Monkey!
__label__neutral	Im not arguing with that.
__label__non-neutral	All right, Ive heard enough. Ive made my decision.
__label__disgust	You are both idiots.
__label__disgust	The joke is not funny, and its offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys!
__label__anger	You shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!
__label__anger	Now let it go!
__label__anger	The joke sucks!
__label__neutral	Its your joke.
__label__anger	Is not.
__label__non-neutral	Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
__label__joy	I didnt!
__label__neutral	Even when I found outumm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
__label__non-neutral	Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
__label__surprise	Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
__label__neutral	Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and
__label__non-neutral	Did you, did you
__label__neutral	No.
__label__non-neutral	Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
__label__joy	Yes!
__label__anger	Then don't touch one!!
__label__surprise	Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
__label__joy	Yeah!
__label__joy	Thanks!
__label__neutral	All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
__label__joy	Done!
__label__non-neutral	And it can't be Joey.
__label__neutral	It's not.
__label__neutral	Or Joseph.
__label__non-neutral	Oh.
__label__neutral	Hi!
__label__joy	Hi! Hey, Pete youre back! Hey, check this out.
__label__joy	Wow! Skates!
__label__surprise	Wow! Youre a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was youre trip?
__label__neutral	Well...
__label__non-neutral	Oh, whatd ya bring me?!
__label__non-neutral	Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan.
__label__joy	Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection.
__label__neutral	You want some coffee?
__label__neutral	Yeah, sure, thatd be great.
__label__neutral	Regular or decaf?
__label__neutral	Ah, which ever is closest.
__label__neutral	Okay.
__label__neutral	So ask me what I did today.
__label__neutral	So what did you do today Pete?
__label__joy	I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
__label__surprise	What?! Oh.
__label__neutral	Hi.
__label__neutral	Hey.
__label__neutral	Where've you been?
__label__neutral	At the vet.
__label__fear	She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
__label__non-neutral	She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
__label__joy	Hey! He beat ya.
__label__sadness	She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
__label__neutral	So what does this mean?
__label__sadness	I'm gonna have to give him up.
__label__anger	Aww man! I cant believe I locked myself out again!
__label__non-neutral	Hang on buddy!
__label__surprise	Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
__label__neutral	I sure did.
__label__surprise	But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
__label__non-neutral	Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
__label__neutral	May I come in?
__label__neutral	Uh, yeah, if you want too.
__label__neutral	Do
__label__neutral	Yeah, sure?
__label__neutral	So do I.
__label__neutral	Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.
__label__neutral	This is just about tonight.
__label__neutral	I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us."
__label__neutral	Okay?
__label__non-neutral	I just want this to be  about what it is!
__label__non-neutral	And um, what-what is that Ross?
__label__joy	The physical act of love.
__label__surprise	What?! Are you crazy?
__label__surprise	Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
__label__surprise	Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
__label__non-neutral	You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
__label__non-neutral	Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
__label__non-neutral	No! No!  No!  No-no-no-no.
__label__surprise	Ohh wow! Im sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
__label__neutral	Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
__label__fear	It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's gonna kill me.
__label__neutral	Yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there.
__label__neutral	Ah Joey.
__label__neutral	Joey Tribbiani.
__label__neutral	Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
__label__non-neutral	So, does that mean the audition is off?
__label__neutral	Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
__label__surprise	What?!
__label__neutral	Aw come on Joey, it's easy.
__label__neutral	Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
__label__non-neutral	It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
__label__neutral	Have fun.
__label__neutral	Bye.
__label__surprise	Wow! Fortunately she has a
__label__surprise	Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
__label__surprise	Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!
__label__surprise	!
__label__neutral	Hi there.
__label__neutral	Hi.
__label__neutral	Hi.
__label__neutral	I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
__label__neutral	Ok.
__label__neutral	Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!
__label__neutral	So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
__label__anger	Oh, DAMN IT!
__label__neutral	Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
__label__neutral	Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.
__label__neutral	Ok.
__label__neutral	Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
__label__non-neutral	Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
__label__non-neutral	We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
__label__joy	Yeah! C'mon!
__label__neutral	Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
__label__neutral	Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
__label__neutral	No, she's at a faculty meeting.
__label__neutral	Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...
__label__neutral	Come in.
__label__neutral	Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
__label__neutral	What's it look like?
__label__neutral	Kinda like a big face without skin.
__label__neutral	Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
__label__surprise	Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
__label__neutral	Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
__label__joy	Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
__label__neutral	Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
__label__surprise	The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
__label__non-neutral	What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
__label__surprise	You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
__label__neutral	I have no idea what you just said.
__label__neutral	Put Joey on the phone.
__label__non-neutral	What's up man?
__label__fear	I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth
__label__non-neutral	Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Chandler, listen.
__label__neutral	Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
__label__neutral	and that was all before 10 oclock.
__label__neutral	The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.
__label__neutral	And then the florist phoned to say there arent any tulips.
__label__neutral	Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.
__label__neutral	Were not gonna be
__label__surprise	Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?
__label__anger	Well, up yours too!
__label__neutral	Wheres Chandler?
__label__surprise	Ah, he cant make it, he said he had to his...  Whoa-oh!
__label__neutral	Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
__label__neutral	Joey I can see you okay? Youre hiding behind the coats.
__label__neutral	Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
__label__non-neutral	Well, if you dont have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
__label__non-neutral	Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
__label__joy	Yeah! You wanna come?
__label__joy	Yeah!
__label__neutral	Fine.
__label__neutral	Fine.
__label__neutral	Fine.
__label__neutral	Fine.
__label__neutral	All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
__label__neutral	Hey.
__label__non-neutral	Whats the matter?
__label__disgust	Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
__label__surprise	Oh Willies still alive!
__label__neutral	What are you guys doing?
__label__non-neutral	Oh, my mom called, theyre gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so were looking for a good picture of us.
__label__neutral	Oooh, Im afraid that does not exist.
__label__surprise	Thats not true, there are great pictures of us!
__label__neutral	No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whos going like this
__label__surprise	Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the
__label__sadness	I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture.
__label__joy	Oh, heres a great one.
__label__neutral	Yeah, Im not in that.
__label__joy	I know, but look at me: all tan.
__label__neutral	Hey, why dont you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.
__label__joy	Thats a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Yknow
__label__neutral	Yeah thats great! Next to that, Chandler wont look so stupid.
__label__neutral	Chandler what do you say?
__label__neutral	All right, but I should warn you, Im not going. Im going.
__label__surprise Why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
__label__non-neutral Oh. Thats so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, Wheres number 27?!
__label__neutral Y'know what?
__label__neutral It didnt.
__label__joy Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what Ive got with Alice.
__label__surprise Now, wh-what, what is that like?
__label__joy Its so cool man, its so, its just cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah.
__label__non-neutral Why cant I find that?
__label__anger Dont ask me, I had it and I blew it!
__label__non-neutral Well, I want it!
__label__non-neutral You can have it!
__label__non-neutral I dont know, maybe I cant. I mean, maybe theres something wrong with me.
__label__non-neutral Oh, no! No!
__label__joy Its out there man! Ive seen it! I got it!!
__label__non-neutral Then you hold on to it!!
__label__joy All right, man!!
__label__joy All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
__label__neutral Come on, Lydia, you can do it.
__label__joy Push!
__label__joy Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder.
__label__joy Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out!
__label__joy Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho.
__label__joy Let's  I was justyeah, right.
__label__joy Push!
__label__joy Push!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
__label__non-neutral Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
__label__surprise Okay, go left. Left! Left!
__label__anger Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
__label__non-neutral Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!
__label__non-neutral Straight up over your head!
__label__joy You can do it!
__label__joy You can do it!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral You got it?
__label__neutral Oh, okay, I get it.
__label__fear No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even
__label__neutral Howard's the
__label__neutral Yes but too me he's just, man.
__label__non-neutral Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
__label__disgust Ugh, can you believe that guy!
__label__neutral Yeah. I really like his glasses.
__label__surprise Ohh!
__label__neutral What?
__label__surprise It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__neutral Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
__label__fear Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
__label__disgust Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!
__label__non-neutral Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I dont have time!
__label__neutral Theyre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
__label__non-neutral Youre coming on to the entire room!  Im Chandler.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral You mind if I
__label__neutral No, please.
__label__neutral So uh, what are you in for?
__label__neutral I talk in my sleep.
__label__neutral What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
__label__neutral So why dont you give me your number?
__label__neutral Previously on Friends.
__label__neutral I dont know exactly. Its-its sorta like wrestling.
__label__surprise Oh?!
__label__neutral Yeah, but without the costumes.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral And its not fake, its totally brutal.
__label__neutral Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Theyre
__label__surprise So you can like, bite, and pull peoples hair and stuff?
__label__neutral Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
__label__surprise Whats fish hooking?
__label__neutral Huh, whats fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
__label__non-neutral What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
__label__non-neutral Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
__label__joy Well, that makes me feel so good.
__label__neutral It was just so awkward and bumpy.
__label__surprise Bumpy?
__label__neutral Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.
__label__neutral And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
__label__non-neutral Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
__label__non-neutral Coming through!  Oh! Coming through!  Oh! Hello! Hi!  No! Right! Coming through!
__label__neutral Oh well, its not so bad.
__label__sadness Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__surprise My God!
__label__neutral Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
__label__surprise Excuse me?
__label__non-neutral Joey! Hes working!  You would look
__label__non-neutral Oh, how bad is it?
__label__sadness Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that isnt burned is an ass. Which I do
__label__neutral Hows your room Rach?
__label__sadness Everythings ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
__label__neutral Isnt that mine?
__label__non-neutral Fine! Im sorry for your loss!
__label__neutral So uh, youre not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
__label__non-neutral Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am
__label__neutral Yes, they can stay with us.
__label__neutral Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
__label__non-neutral Theres just so much pressure.
__label__neutral I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.
__label__neutral I dont know if youd understand.
__label__neutral Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
__label__non-neutral Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!
__label__neutral Well, yknow.
__label__fear I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time.
__label__neutral So Im gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on.
__label__neutral Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Whats all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
__label__neutral Ross, we can handle this.
__label__sadness Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.
__label__anger I mean, enough of the silliness!
__label__anger Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!
__label__non-neutral Okay-okay!
__label__non-neutral Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together.
__label__non-neutral Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?
__label__non-neutral That is so silly.
__label__neutral Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
__label__neutral Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
__label__joy Love is the best medicine.
__label__non-neutral Thats laughter.
__label__neutral Why do you do it?
__label__neutral I dont know.
__label__neutral Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
__label__neutral Yeah, I do.
__label__neutral And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, dont ya?
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__joy Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
__label__neutral Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
__label__surprise You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
__label__neutral Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.
__label__non-neutral Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!
__label__non-neutral Define me!
__label__non-neutral Love me, I need love!
__label__neutral '.
__label__surprise Have you really done this before?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral You just take a big, big swing.
__label__neutral Now, dont hold back.
__label__neutral and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey-hey-hey!
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__joy Were just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
__label__neutral Oh, all right.
__label__joy Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
__label__joy Okay!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Bye!
__label__neutral Bye!
__label__non-neutral Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
__label__neutral Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey.
__label__neutral Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
__label__neutral Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
__label__surprise Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one!
__label__neutral Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials?
__label__non-neutral Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down?
__label__neutral Because we can remember them.
__label__non-neutral Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
__label__neutral Hey. When you guys were kids and you played
__label__neutral I was always Joanne.
__label__neutral Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! the war cry of your neighbourhood?
__label__disgust Ewww! Oh! Its the Mattress King!
__label__non-neutral Booo!!
__label__disgust Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
__label__joy Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
__label__anger What a wank!
__label__anger Oh, I cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses.
__label__non-neutral I know!
__label__non-neutral And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.
__label__non-neutral And Im appalled for you by the way.
__label__non-neutral You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it alone.
__label__disgust Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my food.
__label__anger Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
__label__disgust Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
__label__neutral Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
__label__fear Im, Im freaking out!
__label__fear Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have!
__label__neutral All right, I havent lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.
__label__neutral Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
__label__neutral Um. yeah.
__label__neutral I am
__label__neutral All right, look, heres the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.
__label__neutral So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
__label__non-neutral Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work.
__label__neutral Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but thats why you have got to be the bigger man here.
__label__non-neutral Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me!
__label__non-neutral Like me tiny doctor!
__label__non-neutral Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
__label__non-neutral Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along.
__label__anger Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.
__label__non-neutral Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna have to have a separate room for you too!
__label__anger !
__label__neutral Okay, okay, okay.  Ill get the bagels.
__label__neutral Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
__label__neutral All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
__label__neutral Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
__label__surprise Really? A purse?
__label__non-neutral It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
__label__neutral It looks like a women's purse.
__label__neutral No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,
__label__neutral See look,
__label__neutral Exactly! Unisex!
__label__neutral Maybe you need sex.
__label__non-neutral No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
__label__neutral Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
__label__neutral So, um, have you told your parents?
__label__neutral No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__neutral You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.
__label__neutral .
__label__neutral .
__label__non-neutral no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.
__label__joy I love you Phoebe.
__label__surprise So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral I just came over to drop offnothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, it did.
__label__sadness So, I guess this is over.
__label__neutral What?
__label__sadness Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
__label__non-neutral Why, exactly?
__label__sadness Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
__label__surprise Chandler that's crazy!
__label__anger If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!
__label__neutral So, this isn't over?
__label__joy You are so cute!
__label__non-neutral No.
__label__neutral No, it was a fight.
__label__non-neutral You deal with it and move on!
__label__neutral It's nothing to freak out about.
__label__joy Really? Okay. Great!
__label__joy Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
__label__surprise We're in a relationship?
__label__neutral I'm afraid so.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral So you like the short hair better.
__label__neutral What? YetiI mean Danny?
__label__neutral Can I tell you a little secret?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral I want to keep one.
__label__joy Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
__label__neutral Oh, please.
__label__neutral What? Honey.
__label__neutral Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
__label__sadness Oh God, Im so sorry.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__non-neutral Ow!!
__label__surprise Oh God!
__label__non-neutral Hey, you guys! Guess what?
__label__neutral Got a job on a river boat?
__label__non-neutral Y'know what I didnt wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? Youre not my girlfriend anymore so...
__label__neutral Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
__label__neutral Right.
__label__non-neutral Now that youre on youre own, youre free to look as stupid as you like.
__label__neutral You like it right?
__label__neutral Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! Im kidding!
__label__neutral Yeah, come here!
__label__neutral What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
__label__neutral Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
__label__anger Okay, good bye!

__label__non-neutral Oh down please.  I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?
__label__neutral Could you press up too please?
__label__sadness Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
__label__neutral Oh yeah? Howd yours happen?
__label__neutral Well, its a long story.
__label__neutral Its kind of embarrassing.
__label__non-neutral Lets just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
__label__neutral How about you?
__label__sadness Car accident.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__non-neutral Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasnt paying attention?
__label__neutral Yeah. Me.  Oh hey, thats me.  Hey uh, I take it youre just visiting someone.
__label__neutral Uh-huh, yeah.
__label__neutral Well umm, if you have sometime yknow and maybe you might want to visit someone else

__label__neutral Im in the middle
__label__anger Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
__label__neutral Uh, you gotta press the button.
__label__neutral Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
__label__surprise Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
__label__neutral Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car.    We're way ahead of the game.
__label__surprise Oh my god.
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise There's something new in the bowl.
__label__non-neutral Look, we have enough, just walk away.
__label__joy No, but I want...I want the pinecones!

__label__neutral It's not the same.
__label__non-neutral Ok, go quick!
__label__joy Thank you for a delightful stay.
__label__joy Oh, my maple candy!
__label__surprise Oh my God, what happened?
__label__non-neutral Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
__label__joy Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
__label__non-neutral Oh,  I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
__label__surprise Ross's what?
__label__disgust You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.
__label__neutral Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
__label__surprise Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! Thats my Dad, thats Frank! Yeah! Im sorry Im getting all flingy.
__label__joy Take it easy--if you want, theres cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria!  I can make sangria!
__label__neutral No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral Well, so, umm, anyway umm, Ive been, Ive been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
__label__sadness Oh no, I-Im sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.
__label__neutral Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
__label__neutral Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.
__label__surprise Oh, what? What was it?

__label__sadness Oh, poor Lily.
__label__sadness Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, no, it was great.
__label__sadness Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her,  burping her, oh try this one!
__label__anger Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
__label__neutral Alright here's something, it says to try holding the baby  close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__surprise It worked!
__label__non-neutral Oh  oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit.
__label__non-neutral Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it  won't stop crying.
__label__neutral Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
__label__neutral Yeah, I'm not so sure.
__label__non-neutral Oh my god, I am losing my mind.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from  having sex with Ross!
__label__neutral Well, youre not.
__label__disgust Oh, its so easy for you I mean, youre not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
__label__joy Yeah I can!  And dont think I dont, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
__label__surprise Monica. Youve, youve done it right?
__label__anger Of course I have! What do you think, Im some 30 year old virgin?
__label__surprise Oh my God! Youre a 30 year old virgin!
__label__disgust Say it louder, I dont think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
__label__anger Its not like, I havent any opportunities.
__label__neutral I mean, yknow, Im just waiting for the perfect guy.
__label__neutral Im seeing this guy Roger, all right?
__label__neutral Hes not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.
__label__neutral Yknow, give him my flower.
__label__surprise Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, youve waited
__label__surprise Yknow what? You are right?!
__label__joy Yes!!
__label__non-neutral I mean sex does not have to be a big deal!
__label__non-neutral There shouldnt be all this rules and restrictions!
__label__neutral Yknow, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever
__label__non-neutral Rachel! Im never gonna think its okay for you to cheat on your husband!
__label__non-neutral Oh what do you know? Virgin!
__label__neutral Push, push!
__label__non-neutral We're here!
__label__neutral Where have you been?
__label__neutral Long story, honey.
__label__neutral All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?
__label__neutral C'mon up.
__label__non-neutral Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
__label__anger So, I hear, you hate me!
__label__neutral I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
__label__non-neutral A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
__label__non-neutral And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
__label__anger All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.
__label__neutral So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.
__label__non-neutral But what does that gonna do...
__label__non-neutral For Chandler!
__label__joy Guess what, I got an audition!
__label__joy Awww, one of my students got an audition. Im so proud.
__label__neutral I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
__label__joy You bet! Whats the part?
__label__joy Oh its great, its a role on
__label__neutral Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
__label__neutral I thought he was with you.
__label__neutral He-he was with me umm, were playing a little game, yknow? Hide and seek.
__label__neutral You cant ask us son, thats cheating.
__label__neutral Youre right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
__label__neutral Well, he better not come by here. He cant see the bride in the wedding dress.
__label__non-neutral As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
__label__neutral But that was after the wedding, its not bad luck then.
__label__neutral Honey, it isnt good luck.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Monica!
__label__neutral I know! Hey, hows Chandler doin?
__label__neutral Great. Hes doing great. Dont you worry about Chandler.
__label__neutral Are you okay?
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__joy Yeah baby!
__label__neutral Im really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.
__label__neutral So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
__label__non-neutral I cant believe it! He still hasnt called.
__label__surprise Who, Josh?
__label__non-neutral Its Joshua.
__label__surprise What, he doesnt like Josh?
__label__disgust No, I dont.
__label__neutral All right, well Im gonna put my sweats back on.
__label__surprise Oh no!
__label__fear Wait!
__label__surprise Wait!
__label__non-neutral Okay, yknow what, you were right, you were right.
__label__non-neutral We really werent great at being guys, but you know why?
__label__neutral Because were girls.

__label__neutral Yeah, like I could
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral I played bad on purpose guys.
__label__surprise Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
__label__neutral Yeahno, just that last song.
__label__neutral Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, whos playing?
__label__neutral The players.
__label__neutral Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
__label__neutral Please, its a relief is what it is, is what it is.
__label__neutral All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral Anything?
__label__non-neutral No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasnt heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandlers parents again!
__label__non-neutral You told them he was missing?
__label__neutral No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think Im interested in them.
__label__neutral Whose is it?
__label__neutral I dont want to say.
__label__non-neutral Oh, come on! I dont care! Come on! Whose is it?
__label__neutral Diane Keaton.
__label__anger Phoebe! Come on! Lets go!  Come on!  Why arent you dressed yet?!
__label__neutral Im sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
__label__neutral No, Phoebe, Ill tell you what, if you get ready now Ill let you play it at the wedding.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__joy Oh thats so exciting!
__label__joy Thank you!
__label__joy Thanks Mon!
__label__anger Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again Ill have to pound on you for a little bit.
__label__neutral Fair enough, now go get ready!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Ill get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my Im sorry, uh apparently Ive opened the door to the past.

__label__joy Down at the heel, holes in the toes.
__label__non-neutral Dont care what people say.
__label__joy My feets best friends, pals to the end.
__label__joy With them Im one hot chicky.
__label__neutral Though late one night, not much light, I....
__label__non-neutral I stepped in something icky.
__label__joy Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time Ill.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
__label__sadness God, its gonna so weird like when I come home and youre not here.
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__sadness No more Joey and Chans.
__label__sadness No more J and Cs.
__label__neutral "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandlers?"
__label__neutral "Cant, its not there."
__label__neutral Look, Im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
__label__sadness Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
__label__neutral Not once did we do that.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
__label__neutral Oh yeah? Well, howd she take it?
__label__neutral Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didnt cry. She wasnt angry or sad.
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__neutral Im not going to do that.
__label__neutral Okay, if you need the vacuum, its in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator
__label__neutral Okay, okay, but Rachels gonna be here too, cant I just ask her this stuff?
__label__neutral Yeah, okay, give that a try!
__label__joy All right! Lets do it!
__label__joy Woo-hoo!!
__label__joy Yeah, cheerie-o!
__label__joy London baby!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Monica? What time is it?
__label__neutral Uhh, 9.
__label__neutral But it's dark out.
__label__neutral Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
__label__neutral I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
__label__neutral I'm
__label__neutral I know, me too.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__non-neutral Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?
__label__joy Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
__label__non-neutral All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
__label__neutral Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
__label__joy Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
__label__neutral Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
__label__neutral Wait! What about Joey?
__label__neutral Oh umm, theres also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?
__label__neutral Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
__label__non-neutral Im so sorry!
__label__non-neutral Sorry!
__label__neutral You didnt bring
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
__label__neutral Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
__label__disgust To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, youre
__label__neutral No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
__label__surprise Oh, youre switching apartments?
__label__neutral Its not for me, its for Rachel.
__label__neutral But Rachel has an apartment.
__label__neutral Yeah, but when the baby comes shes gonna want to move.
__label__surprise She is?
__label__surprise Yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you?
__label__neutral I guess I didnt really think about it.
__label__non-neutral Ezel!  Hey Gunther! Youre an ezel!
__label__anger Damnit!
__label__surprise Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people?
__label__neutral Little village people.
__label__joy Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
__label__joy Oh, that is so sweet!
__label__joy I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
__label__neutral Huh. Except, Phoebes not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
__label__sadness Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies.
__label__sadness Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
__label__surprise Wait a minute!
__label__joy Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after shes done being pregnant.
__label__neutral Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
__label__joy Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants shes always wanted!
__label__joy Oh, shes gonna love that!
__label__neutral Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
__label__neutral Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
__label__neutral So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
__label__anger Fine, Im mentally unstable.
__label__neutral And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Uh yes, heroin and crack.
__label__anger Crack isnt even an intravenous drug!
__label__neutral Well, you would know.
__label__neutral Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
__label__non-neutral Oh, come on!
__label__non-neutral Ross, please, I found the magazines!
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__neutral Phoebe just because I'm alone doesnt mean I wanna walk around naked.
__label__neutral I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
__label__non-neutral Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
__label__sadness I know, I lied! I didnt want her to think I was a terrible mother! I cant even see my own baby!
__label__neutral Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  its-its-its, its right there .
__label__joy Oh. Oh, its beautiful. I see it now.
__label__neutral Do you really?
__label__anger No, I dont see it!
__label__joy Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this?  This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy Sweetie thats it.
__label__joy Thats it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
__label__neutral Youre welcome.
__label__surprise Wow! I cant believe thats our baby.
__label__joy Yeah, thats our baby.
__label__neutral Gin.
__label__joy We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
__label__non-neutral Will you stop!
__label__neutral Okay. All right.
__label__joy Okay, all right, I think youre great, I think youre sweet, and youre smart, and I love you.
__label__disgust But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
__label__joy Hey, check me out, Im a slut!
__label__neutral So you uh, want to do something tonight?
__label__neutral Oh I cant. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__surprise Oh right!
__label__surprise Right!
__label__sadness Because youre still seeing him and uh, hes a good guy.
__label__sadness I mean, I remember a time when
__label__neutral Are you okay?
__label__joy Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
__label__joy Great! Its so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was
__label__neutral I bet he can.
__label__neutral Yknow, I dont have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure youre okay?
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah! Yeah! Dont worry about me, Ill be fine!
__label__neutral You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
__label__neutral Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
__label__non-neutral Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby?
__label__neutral Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
__label__non-neutral oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks.
__label__surprise I can't believe    I didn't even think of that.
__label__non-neutral I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...
__label__non-neutral What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?
__label__non-neutral It was a "Wendy's!!    "
__label__surprise ...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
__label__disgust Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else?
__label__surprise Like you, I dont even know where you work?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__anger So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
__label__neutral Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think Ill show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
__label__non-neutral Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
__label__non-neutral Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
__label__non-neutral Yeah!
__label__neutral Well, Im not going to go now anyway .
__label__neutral Okay .
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__neutral Ah, Gunther, I cant pay for this right now because Im not working, so Ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin for stuff.
__label__neutral Well, if you want, you can work here.
__label__neutral Uh, I dont know.
__label__neutral Ya see, its just, see I was a regular on a soap opera yknow?
__label__sadness And to go from that to this, I just Plus, Id have to wait on all my friends.
__label__neutral Okay, but the moneys good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Flexible hours.
__label__neutral Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
__label__neutral I have no name.
__label__neutral All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
__label__neutral Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
__label__disgust No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
__label__surprise Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
__label__neutral Umm, Gene.
__label__anger Its Clint. Its Clint!

__label__joy Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
__label__neutral Hope you had a nice flight.
__label__joy Ohh, it was the best!
__label__neutral Oh, Larry.
__label__neutral Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
__label__neutral No, bribes.
__label__non-neutral It's okay to laugh right?
__label__non-neutral Come on Joey!!!
__label__non-neutral Rach, I told you everything I knew last night!
__label__neutral Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
__label__non-neutral I can't believe you would say that!
__label__neutral Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
__label__non-neutral No! I mean come on! This is a
__label__neutral I don't know.
__label__non-neutral Is he romantic with her?
__label__neutral I don't know.
__label__non-neutral Are they in love?
__label__neutral I don't know.
__label__anger You don't know anything.
__label__non-neutral Ohh, I know one thing!
__label__non-neutral What?
__label__non-neutral They did it right there on the couch.
__label__non-neutral Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in.
__label__non-neutral I mean, that guy with the toe thing?
__label__neutral Who's he sleeping with?
__label__neutral Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...
__label__neutral I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.
__label__non-neutral Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-!
__label__neutral So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.
__label__neutral So where did you study?
__label__neutral Oh, I didn't go to college.
__label__neutral No, where did you study acting?
__label__neutral Molly ... people don't study acting ...
__label__neutral Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
__label__neutral Sure, I'll go check on Emma.
__label__neutral Thanx.
__label__sadness Will the stable boy never get the princess??
__label__disgust What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here    on my couch?
__label__non-neutral No ... the leather sticks to my ass.
__label__anger You know, this isn't fair.
__label__anger What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?
__label__non-neutral Huh?
__label__anger Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?
__label__non-neutral Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?
__label__sadness I didn't think I could ever love again.
__label__non-neutral Come on! Joe!
__label__neutral Ok
__label__neutral Hi, is Molly here?
__label__neutral Yeah, come on in. Molly?
__label__neutral Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha .  I'll see you tomorrow.
__label__neutral Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess    we have no problem.
__label__joy It's like my favorite fairy tale come true!  The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!
__label__non-neutral And whats cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
__label__neutral Yeah.

__label__neutral I totally understand.
__label__non-neutral You need to yknow make sure I dont have any horrible scars or tattoos.
__label__non-neutral Dont you worry; I have nothing to hide.
__label__neutral So there you go, thats me.
__label__joy One hundred percent natural!
__label__non-neutral I tell ya, that has never happened before.
__label__neutral This rooms available.
__label__joy Okay!
__label__non-neutral Okay wait!
__label__anger You listen to me!
__label__anger You listen to me!
__label__non-neutral Since I have been waiting four women, thats four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies!
__label__anger Im next!
__label__anger Its my turn!
__label__anger Its only fair!
__label__anger And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me Im going to sue you!
__label__anger Not this hospital, Im going to sue you!
__label__non-neutral And my husband  hes a lawyer!
__label__neutral Uh Rach
__label__anger Go get back on that case honey!
__label__neutral I dont think the next patient is very far along.
__label__neutral Okay, well then bring her in.
__label__surprise OH.MY.GAWD!!!
__label__fear Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that oneDude! Theyre all huge!
__label__non-neutral They dont look any bigger than me!
__label__non-neutral Well, maybe thats because youre closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
__label__neutral Im just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__joy Whoa!  I kinda liked it.
__label__non-neutral Okay, I know what I have to do. Ive got to go Red Ross.  Yknow, Red Ross!
__label__non-neutral I totally dont know what youre talking about.
__label__non-neutral Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for
__label__non-neutral Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
__label__neutral No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportive like crazy.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral We just want you to think it through.
__label__neutral Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody whos had a baby. Like your mom?
__label__neutral My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
__label__neutral Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
__label__neutral Thank you. All right.
__label__neutral Come, sit.
__label__neutral Sit.
__label__anger Sit!
__label__neutral Umm, all righty, before we get started I justI need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
__label__neutral Lucky sixes....
__label__neutral Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
__label__neutral Hi!
__label__neutral And Joey....
__label__neutral Hi!
__label__neutral And Ross.
__label__neutral Hi!
__label__neutral He doesn't speak much English.
__label__surprise Look at that!
__label__neutral So, um... where did Paolo come from?
__label__neutral Oh... Italy, I think.
__label__neutral No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
__label__neutral Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
__label__neutral That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
__label__neutral Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
__label__neutral Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
__label__non-neutral Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
__label__neutral Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
__label__non-neutral You betcha!
__label__surprise Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
__label__neutral When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
__label__anger That cup is mine!
__label__anger No its not! You want it, youre gonna have to win it!
__label__non-neutral All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
__label__non-neutral Why?
__label__neutral Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
__label__neutral I know I do.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Guess what?
__label__neutral What?
__label__joy They published my paper.
__label__joy Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
__label__non-neutral Rach, look!  Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.  There he is.
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__anger What?! You got us evicted!!
__label__anger I told you not to go down there!
__label__disgust Well he made Rachel cry!
__label__anger Rachel always cries!
__label__anger Thats not true!
__label__neutral Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like youve never sucked before!
__label__neutral All right! Ill try! But if I cant, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
__label__anger Go!!
__label__neutral All right, all right, all right.
__label__neutral I mean Ill have to check with him first, but Ill think hell be cool with it.
__label__non-neutral So, hes just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesnt want anything in exchange for helping him?
__label__neutral Well, I assume Ill have to take showers with him, but y'know, thats true of any job.
__label__neutral How ya feelin?
__label__neutral Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it.
__label__neutral Whered you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
__label__joy Woooo hoooo!!!
__label__non-neutral Ow, no woo-hooing, no woo-hooing.
__label__surprise Why, what happened?
__label__non-neutral Ah, I fooled around with Joeys sister.  Well, thats not the worst part.
__label__neutral What is the worse part?
__label__non-neutral I cant remember which sister.
__label__anger You see what men do! Dont tell me men are not nice!  This is men!!
__label__non-neutral Whats wrong with you?
__label__anger Nothing!
__label__sadness Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.
__label__neutral But um, I dont think its anything serious.
__label__surprise This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-youGo to the doctor!
__label__anger No way!
__label__non-neutral Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
__label__disgust Why did I have to start working out again?
__label__anger Damn you 15s!
__label__neutral Its a trifle.
__label__neutral Its got all of these layers.
__label__neutral First theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.
__label__non-neutral [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like somethings wrong.]
__label__neutral then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
__label__disgust It tastes like feet!
__label__joy I like it.
__label__surprise Are you kidding?
__label__neutral Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
__label__neutral No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
__label__joy Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
__label__joy Oh, oh! It's on again!
__label__disgust You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
__label__anger Shhhh!
__label__neutral Folks, has this ever happened to you.
__label__neutral You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
__label__non-neutral Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!
__label__neutral And there is Kevin.
__label__non-neutral Can we please turn this off?
__label__non-neutral Noo way, Kevin.
__label__neutral There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
__label__surprise Are you intrigued?
__label__joy You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
__label__non-neutral Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.
__label__neutral Go ahead.
__label__neutral This works with any milk carton.
__label__surprise Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.
__label__neutral Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay.
__label__non-neutral She is not  Shes gay. Oh my God. She is
__label__surprise Good day for married people huh?
__label__sadness Im sorry your husband cheated on you.
__label__non-neutral Im sorry your wife is gay. I guess women arent that great either.
__label__non-neutral Try telling my wife that.
__label__neutral Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
__label__joy I can't wait to be with you!
__label__neutral I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.
__label__neutral I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
__label__non-neutral Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
__label__non-neutral Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
__label__disgust Arghh!!
__label__non-neutral I cant believe Im going to lose this job!
__label__sadness Oh Im so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
__label__neutral Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
__label__neutral Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__anger Well, I dont want to talk to you Wayne!
__label__anger I hate you!
__label__anger You ruined my life!
__label__neutral Oh, Chandler, Wayne.
__label__neutral Wayne, Chandler.
__label__neutral Hi, how are ya?
__label__neutral Joey, Joey, I-I-Ill g-get you your job back if you help me out.
__label__non-neutral Why should I help you?!
__label__neutral The reason he just said.
__label__neutral What do you need?
__label__neutral I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, yknow Sarah?
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral And I too am just a love machine.
__label__neutral Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
__label__surprise Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out its a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
__label__joy See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
__label__surprise You chipped in?!
__label__neutral Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
__label__surprise Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, but they didn't ask me!
__label__non-neutral Y'know?
__label__joy This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger.
__label__joy That's always fun to be.
__label__anger Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
__label__neutral No I'm not.
__label__surprise No!
__label__non-neutral If anything I'm making you look better!
__label__joy They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
__label__joy Oh hey, Pheebs!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Oh hey, Ross.
__label__fear Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people.
__label__neutral Something to think about.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, okay, my bad.
__label__neutral Alright, alright, alright...
__label__neutral Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
__label__neutral For what?
__label__joy Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
__label__disgust Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
__label__joy Thank you!
__label__neutral Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
__label__non-neutral He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
__label__disgust C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!
__label__neutral I warned you...

__label__neutral No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it.
__label__neutral 'Kay?
__label__neutral Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life?
__label__neutral Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
__label__neutral Sure.
__label__neutral Oh, um, Chandler?

__label__neutral Okay, Im gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!"
__label__neutral Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, Ill set you up with a clean one.
__label__sadness Okay, Im sorry.
__label__sadness I didnt mean to scare you.
__label__neutral I just have to clean that up.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral Cause lets face it, were at Monicas.
__label__non-neutral I broke it.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Well, thats just the way that goes.
__label__neutral Okay, good.
__label__non-neutral Why are there only two of you?

__label__neutral Oh, theres banana on it.
__label__non-neutral You said she was bald.
__label__neutral Yeah, she was bald, shes not now.
__label__surprise How could you not tell me that she has hair?
__label__neutral I dont know, I hardly ever say that about people.
__label__anger Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
__label__non-neutral Well Im sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got
__label__non-neutral Well, maybe it wont work out. Maybe Ross wont like her personality.
__label__neutral Why, does she have a bad personality?
__label__non-neutral Oh no, Bonnies the best!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__fear Do you have a minute? Id like to talk to you about something Im, Im really uncomfortable talking about.
__label__non-neutral Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
__label__non-neutral I actually had a topic in mind! Im, Im kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
__label__surprise Whoa, for like months?
__label__joy Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff yknow, sexually?
__label__surprise No!
__label__neutral Oooh, wrong answer.
__label__non-neutral Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay.  Oh, shhh!
__label__non-neutral No! No!! Its me! Its me! I-I didnt want to make any noise!
__label__non-neutral Then don't break in!!
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
__label__neutral I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
__label__disgust Then why are you smoking?
__label__non-neutral Well its very unsettling.
__label__neutral Honey, I was wondering....
__label__neutral Hmm?
__label__non-neutral Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
__label__non-neutral Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
__label__neutral Hmm.
__label__non-neutral I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
__label__non-neutral You remember not having sex in high school, right?
__label__sadness Yeah.
__label__neutral Well honey, what about you?
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
__label__neutral No.
__label__surprise Come on you gotta have one!
__label__disgust Ugh!
__label__non-neutral I dont know Monica.
__label__non-neutral It feels funny just being here.
__label__non-neutral I mean if you buy a bed from Janices ex-husband, thats like betraying Chandler.
__label__non-neutral Not at these prices.
__label__joy Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.  Woo!
__label__joy Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
__label__surprise Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandlers your friend...  Oh!
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
__label__joy You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
__label__non-neutral Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
__label__anger By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
__label__neutral That's OK.
__label__surprise Oh, are you sure?
__label__surprise Really?
__label__anger Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
__label__neutral We can't do that.
__label__surprise What? What can't you do?
__label__surprise She really said that?
__label__neutral Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...
__label__neutral But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
__label__surprise 'Tonight' tonight?
__label__joy Well, I think it's perfect.
__label__neutral Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
__label__non-neutral I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
__label__joy Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
__label__disgust Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
__label__neutral Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
__label__neutral No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
__label__joy Alright, well, be good, I love you.
__label__anger You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
__label__sadness O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
__label__anger Really stupid.
__label__non-neutral Really stupid.
__label__non-neutral And I don't even know how it happened.
__label__sadness I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.
__label__fear Are we okay now?
__label__anger Yeah. No. No...
__label__neutral Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
__label__neutral Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
__label__surprise You're kidding.
__label__neutral No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
__label__neutral Oh there it is.
__label__neutral Thats not your regular dry cleaners.
__label__disgust I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one.
__label__disgust I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral A new grocery store.
__label__non-neutral The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and thats what they gave me?
__label__anger When I get up there Im going to kick some ass.
__label__neutral Dont worry Phoebe, youre gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
__label__neutral Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
__label__neutral Oh, you didnt have to come in with me.
__label__non-neutral Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__surprise Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s Wow!
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise Im sorry, its just that youre so incredibly beautiful.
__label__neutral Oh yeah well, Im sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?
__label__non-neutral I hope you dont think Im crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
__label__neutral A little.   Now youre talking.
__label__neutral Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
__label__joy I-I-Id love to. Let me just tell my friend.
__label__joy Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
__label__neutral She mustve left.
__label__anger Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
__label__surprise Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
__label__joy That's right baby.
__label__neutral All right, let me in.
__label__non-neutral No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral He's a dropper!
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah, that's right!
__label__anger I'm not a dropper!
__label__neutral It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
__label__non-neutral It's throwing and catching!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__surprise Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
__label__non-neutral Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
__label__surprise Oh myOh good God!
__label__non-neutral I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
__label__neutral Baking it didn't help, huh?
__label__neutral All right, well the place was closed. Ill just copy it later.
__label__non-neutral Or not. Uh, Rach, why dont you just move in with me?
__label__surprise Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
__label__neutral No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no Its okay, I mean Ilook Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursdays thing, but we dont have to do that!
__label__neutral Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless youre thinking about Naked Wednesdays.
__label__joy Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
__label__joy So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
__label__neutral Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
__label__non-neutral Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
__label__disgust Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
__label__neutral I was shrieking... like a Marine.
__label__neutral All right here. Watch me execute the three Ps of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.
__label__neutral She's not much of a phone person.
__label__neutral Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
__label__non-neutral Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
__label__neutral Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
__label__non-neutral Maybe you should.
__label__non-neutral Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
__label__neutral You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
__label__neutral Oh, that is so not true.
__label__neutral Oh, it is.
__label__neutral It isn't.
__label__neutral It is.
__label__anger Isn't!
__label__neutral Okay ladies, that ends todays class, and lets remember, lets be safe out there.
__label__joy Its a great class.
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah, I was watching.
__label__neutral Umm, hey, a couple of questions though.
__label__non-neutral Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
__label__neutral Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them
__label__non-neutral No. No-no. No. What would
__label__surprise Who? Me the attacker?
__label__sadness Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you.
__label__sadness Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
__label__surprise No-noReally?!
__label__non-neutral Of course!
__label__sadness Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh
__label__sadness Ohh, Im sorry.
__label__neutral Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
__label__non-neutral What?! Anything! Anything!
__label__neutral Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.
__label__non-neutral This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
__label__surprise Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
__label__neutral Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later.
__label__neutral Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over here. All right, come on
__label__non-neutral Hey, you guys. Listen, Im sorry that I was hogging the game beforeOh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
__label__neutral Theyre all Chandler.
__label__surprise Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good!
__label__neutral I did.  But it came at a price.
__label__fear But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.
__label__surprise Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!
__label__joy Sure!
__label__neutral Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?
__label__joy With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!
__label__joy And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!
__label__neutral Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much.
__label__joy Well, I like that idea.
__label__joy Obviously!
__label__neutral I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow?
__label__neutral I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like
__label__disgust No.
__label__non-neutral Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely."
__label__disgust Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
__label__surprise So, thats it?
__label__neutral I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
__label__neutral Which is why
__label__anger What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
__label__non-neutral I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
__label__non-neutral Are you mocking me?
__label__neutral No, Im not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.
__label__joy Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
__label__joy Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
__label__neutral Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but
__label__neutral Cat.
__label__joy Yes! You are so smart!  I love you.
__label__joy I love you too.
__label__non-neutral I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
__label__surprise Why?
__label__neutral I don't know.
__label__joy This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
__label__neutral That's
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has
__label__neutral But
__label__disgust No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
__label__neutral Okay. Okay, but you cant fire him today.
__label__non-neutral Why not?!
__label__non-neutral Because Im dumping him today.
__label__surprise What?! You said he was sweet!
__label__neutral He
__label__neutral Just dont pick up your phone.
__label__disgust Then he comes over!  "Im so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
__label__surprise What? So now Im not allowed to fire him?
__label__non-neutral You cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill himself.
__label__neutral Okay well then, Ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
__label__disgust Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill
__label__neutral Okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it!
__label__non-neutral Okay. But the question is whos gonna go first. Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
__label__non-neutral Really? Thats the thing Im worse at! Youll see.
__label__neutral This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
__label__sadness Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
__label__sadness Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone?
__label__neutral Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
__label__neutral Oh. Well, Ill right you everyday.  15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
__label__sadness Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
__label__neutral Chandler?
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__non-neutral Chandler!
__label__non-neutral Janice!
__label__surprise There you are!
__label__surprise There you are!
__label__non-neutral I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
__label__neutral No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
__label__joy Well, I then guess Im going to Yemen! Im going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral HeyOoh, hows Hilda? Is she working out?
__label__neutral Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
__label__neutral Was she happy you gave her the job?
__label__neutral Oh, my-my new assistant was very happy that I hired my new assistant.
__label__neutral Hello?
__label__surprise Oh hey!
__label__neutral Can you, can you hang on a second?
__label__neutral Its the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
__label__neutral can you excuse me for a minute?
__label__non-neutral Hey, funny you should call.
__label__neutral I was just looking over next weeks script.
__label__surprise Canceled?!
__label__surprise Like theyre taking it off the air?
__label__neutral Ohh.
__label__neutral All right, see you Monday.
__label__surprise Were not even shootin them anymore?!!
__label__non-neutral All right, bye!
__label__non-neutral They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
__label__sadness Sorry.
__label__sadness Im sorry Joey.
__label__surprise Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
__label__neutral Its so secluded up here.
__label__joy I know. I like it up here.
__label__non-neutral I feel like were the only two people in the world.  Oops. Sorry.
__label__non-neutral Whats the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
__label__fear No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-Iwould youactually, would you go check on that?
__label__neutral Honey, we dont have any bears here.
__label__neutral Well, okay. Would-would you get me a
__label__neutral Okay. Ill be right back.
__label__surprise Okay.  What?! What are you doing here?!
__label__neutral What are
__label__non-neutral I came with Paul!
__label__neutral Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
__label__anger Get up!
__label__joy Here you go honey!
__label__joy Ahh. Thank you!
__label__neutral Diet Coke
__label__non-neutral What the hell was that?!
__label__neutral A lesson in the importance of unagi.
__label__neutral Ohh,
__label__neutral Perhaps. Now Im curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to
__label__neutral All right, so we werent
__label__neutral Im sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but Ilook, I just want you guys to be safe.
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral Im leaning. This is where I lean.
__label__neutral Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
__label__fear Brenda a bee!
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
__label__disgust I think I know whats going on here.
__label__neutral You do?
__label__disgust Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its wrong. Youre married.
__label__neutral I totally understand.  Can I
__label__joy All right, let's do it!
__label__surprise No, no, no. What was that?
__label__neutral I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
__label__non-neutral Well, people!
__label__neutral People, people, people.
__label__neutral Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey.
__label__neutral Show 'em how it's done.
__label__neutral Count it off.
__label__neutral So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
__label__disgust Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and hes so cheap, hed never fly to London in a million years.
__label__neutral Yeah, invite him?
__label__neutral Hey, did I do these neat enough?
__label__neutral Yeah, theyre fine.
__label__non-neutral Yeah?
__label__surprise If anyone asks, well just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
__label__neutral Sure. Why not?
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__non-neutral I dont think Id be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
__label__fear Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldnt invite her?
__label__non-neutral Oh, no-no, yknow I absolutely adore Rachel its just that, well it might be a awkward for you.
__label__neutral But its absolutely your decision.
__label__neutral More tea?
__label__neutral Yeah sure.
__label__neutral Earl Grey?
__label__non-neutral Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hey! So how was the doctor?
__label__joy Oh, everything went great.
__label__neutral Good.
__label__neutral Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
__label__non-neutral Oh.
__label__neutral I dont see the baby. Where is it?
__label__non-neutral Oh no, I know I couldnt see it either at first, but its right umm  Ross, I lost it again.
__label__non-neutral Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
__label__neutral Excuse me?
__label__neutral Could you help me with something?
__label__neutral The patient Im looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.
__label__neutral And umm, hes like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
__label__neutral I think I know who youre talking about.
__label__joy Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
__label__neutral Im sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff
__label__neutral Uh, shes with me.  Dr. Drake Remoray.
__label__neutral Dr. Drake who?
__label__neutral Remoray. Its Portuguese. We need that information; Im a doctor.
__label__surprise A doctor at this hospital?
__label__anger Damnit woman were losing precious time! Now do you want this mans blood on your head?
__label__neutral Hands.
__label__neutral Hands!
__label__neutral It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in.
__label__neutral Hes a patient of mine, Ive been treating him for years!
__label__neutral Hes in room 816.
__label__joy 816, thank you!
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral And what is his name?
__label__surprise No!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
__label__non-neutral Awww.
__label__joy Thanks a million.
__label__joy Oh, youre welcome a million.
__label__neutral Okay, Ill see you in our room.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__neutral Okay, I gotta go.
__label__surprise Whoa! What?! Why?!
__label__sadness Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
__label__surprise Here?! Now?!
__label__neutral Well, yeah.
__label__fear I cant-I cant stay here all night, and if I go in there shes-shes gonna wanna... do stuff.
__label__surprise What happened?
__label__sadness Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago.
__label__joy Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
__label__anger Stupid, useless Canadian money!
__label__neutral Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Will you call him?
__label__joy Yes!
__label__joy I will!
__label__joy Absolutely!
__label__neutral (She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other.
__label__neutral She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in
__label__joy Oh my God! That is so good!
__label__neutral Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral What do you got there?
__label__neutral Oh its umm, its tofu cake. Do you want some?
__label__neutral What are you doing tonight?
__label__neutral Huh? Uh
__label__surprise Dude! Dude!
__label__neutral Oh!  Sorry. Uh, Ive got those plans with Phoebe, why?
__label__surprise Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
__label__surprise What?! Tonight?!
__label__neutral Thats what Monica said.
__label__surprise After she gave me that big speech?!
__label__anger She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?
__label__anger I think shes trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
__label__neutral Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
__label__disgust Who cares? I repel women.
__label__surprise No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Its yours!
__label__non-neutral Yeah well, Im-Im a slut.
__label__neutral Me too.
__label__joy Hi Jill!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hi .
__label__neutral Rachel.
__label__surprise Rachel! Well, you-youre not at home, youre-youre-youre right here.
__label__non-neutral Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But its not!
__label__neutral Okay. So well Ill umm,  Ill have her home by midnight.
__label__non-neutral That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
__label__sadness I'm sorry, man.
__label__neutral Hey, y'know what you should do?
__label__neutral You should make something happen for yourself.
__label__neutral Y'know, like-like write a play.
__label__joy Write a movie!
__label__neutral Huh?
__label__neutral I mean, what about those
__label__sadness Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
__label__joy Wait a second, I could star in it!
__label__neutral Or that.
__label__non-neutral I can't write!
__label__sadness Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?
__label__sadness I can't do it.
__label__neutral I'll help you.
__label__neutral Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.
__label__neutral And plus, it'll give me something to do.
__label__neutral Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
__label__neutral Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope thats cool.
__label__neutral Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.
__label__neutral Although, I should probably tell you, shes a porn star.
__label__neutral Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__non-neutral As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
__label__neutral Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt have to apologize.
__label__neutral I would really love it if I could do both.
__label__non-neutral All right, II have to ask.
__label__neutral What?
__label__fear Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
__label__surprise What?!
__label__anger Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
__label__disgust A hundred and forty-five pounds.
__label__non-neutral Yes, yes it is. Its uh  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
__label__non-neutral Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me?
__label__anger Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didnt bring you here so you can ambush her.
__label__neutral Frannie was the one who found your
__label__anger That bitch!
__label__surprise Monica! What
__label__anger Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
__label__neutral Hi Frannie, congratulations.
__label__anger You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!
__label__surprise Why?!
__label__non-neutral WhatWhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding?
__label__non-neutral What could I have possibly done?!
__label__anger Stuart!
__label__neutral I believe you know my husband.
__label__neutral So its really a question of
__label__non-neutral Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
__label__surprise Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
__label__neutral Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
__label__surprise Yeah?
__label__neutral It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
__label__neutral What's up?
__label__neutral Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk.
__label__neutral Man to uh, me.
__label__neutral Sure. Okay.
__label__surprise Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
__label__neutral Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
__label__neutral You mean scared.
__label__neutral No, I mean happy.
__label__joy Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
__label__sadness Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in.
__label__surprise What do you mean, theyre not moving in? They-theyre still moving in right?
__label__neutral No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
__label__surprise What?! Over a stupid room!
__label__joy Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but Im also really psyched cause I dont have to move in here!
__label__joy Oh no, yeah no, that parts great!
__label__neutral Yes
__label__surprise Shut-out!!
__label__surprise Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
__label__non-neutral Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
__label__anger Yeah, get out!
__label__anger You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!
__label__anger Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?
__label__anger Come on, wussies!
__label__neutral All right, ok, I gotta go.
__label__neutral I'm going,  and I'm gone.
__label__neutral One more game?
__label__joy Oh yeah!
__label__sadness Im sorry.
__label__sadness Ohhh. Dont go.
__label__non-neutral No, I-I-I gotta go.
__label__non-neutral No. No! No! No!
__label__non-neutral Honey, honey, people are looking.
__label__anger I dont care!  I dont care!!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, um, Im, Im leaving now.
__label__non-neutral You cant leave! I have your shoe!
__label__non-neutral Good-bye Chandler Bing.
__label__neutral Rachel has those in burgendy.
__label__disgust Oh, ew!
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you.
__label__neutral Um, can you roll your tongue?
__label__neutral Because I can, and my Mom couldnt, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
__label__neutral What, wait, you mean like this?
__label__surprise Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
__label__neutral Your not doing it.
__label__neutral Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I cant. We dont have that....
__label__neutral Where there is no fear of commitment.
__label__neutral Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
__label__neutral Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.
__label__neutral But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.
__label__fear It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!
__label__neutral If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.
__label__neutral Right.
__label__neutral In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
__label__non-neutral Amazingly, that makes sense.
__label__neutral You think?
__label__joy Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
__label__fear Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
__label__joy Hey!  Hey!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
__label__joy Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
__label__neutral Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
__label__neutral Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
__label__surprise Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!
__label__non-neutral Im missin picture time?!
__label__anger Yknow she has a face Ross!
__label__non-neutral Okay. Okay, heres a good one of us.
__label__joy Wow!
__label__joy That is a good one!
__label__joy Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card yknow, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
__label__neutral Yknow, every year I say Im gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it.
__label__neutral Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?
__label__surprise Together? Like-like to people?
__label__joy Yeah, yknow. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. Itll be cute, okay?
__label__non-neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?
__label__neutral Uh sure, sure.
__label__neutral Bye guys.
__label__non-neutral I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
__label__non-neutral You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve got a girlfriend?
__label__neutral Is this about Mark?
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral Okay, its not, its not.
__label__non-neutral Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
__label__neutral Fine, youre right.
__label__neutral Lets ah, lets take a break,  lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
__label__non-neutral No. A break from us.
__label__non-neutral Bing! Were all set for tonight, 8 oclock.
__label__non-neutral Oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. Monica has to work.
__label__non-neutral Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
__label__neutral Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.
__label__non-neutral Oh? Why not?
__label__neutral Its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament.
__label__non-neutral Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
__label__non-neutral Well now-now youre just talking crazy.
__label__neutral So why cant the three of us go out together?
__label__sadness Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
__label__non-neutral Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.
__label__joy And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
__label__anger Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
__label__neutral Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this.
__label__joy Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club.
__label__anger Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.
__label__neutral Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.
__label__neutral It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.
__label__anger : Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!
__label__neutral It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy.
__label__neutral Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.
__label__neutral There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.
__label__neutral Did he call?
__label__sadness No. Sorry.
__label__non-neutral Why?! Why?! He said hed call. Why hasnt he called?
__label__neutral Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
__label__non-neutral Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasnt he called, Rachel? Why?
__label__neutral Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
__label__surprise Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
__label__neutral Well...
__label__non-neutral The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you?
__label__neutral No. I...
__label__anger Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
__label__non-neutral And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?
__label__non-neutral I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion!
__label__anger Is that too much to ask after six years?!
__label__non-neutral I mean what?
__label__non-neutral Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!
__label__non-neutral I mean do we not have as much fun?!
__label__non-neutral Dont I deserve a few tears?!!
__label__non-neutral I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__anger I did not cry my eyes out!!
__label__non-neutral Come on!
__label__sadness Its like the end of an era!
__label__sadness No more J-man and Channies!
__label__non-neutral !
__label__non-neutral Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
__label__neutral Do I know why were rushing?
__label__neutral Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
__label__neutral Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.
__label__joy Oh, I found it!
__label__surprise !
__label__joy Thats so great for you guys!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Good luck, with your girlfriend.
__label__joy Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!
__label__neutral Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
__label__neutral Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
__label__neutral So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
__label__joy Yes, you can, very much.
__label__surprise Ahhhh!!
__label__non-neutral Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
__label__neutral Do
__label__neutral Ah,
__label__neutral Do
__label__neutral Ah,
__label__non-neutral DO YOU?
__label__non-neutral Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was a beautiful speech.
__label__disgust Oh, come on.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__joy All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!
__label__neutral And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.
__label__neutral And what you said about Nana.
__label__non-neutral Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there.
__label__neutral And you know what?
__label__neutral I think she was.
__label__surprise Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
__label__neutral You forget how many great songs Heart had.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
__label__non-neutral So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
__label__neutral Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but Im not even sure I got it.
__label__neutral What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey.
__label__neutral And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.
__label__non-neutral You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
__label__neutral Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
__label__anger I cant find garbage bags!
__label__neutral Oh, I think I saw some in here.
__label__surprise What is it?!
__label__disgust I dont know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itll die.
__label__non-neutral I cant believe were living here!
__label__surprise You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really  proposing?
__label__non-neutral No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.
__label__surprise Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it  look like?!
__label__non-neutral I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of  it.
__label__non-neutral Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
__label__sadness Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don't want to hurt her.
__label__neutral Okay, look, just do it gently.
__label__neutral You're right.
__label__neutral You're right.
__label__neutral I-I'll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I'll be gentle.
__label__neutral I can do that.
__label__neutral I am a gentle person.
__label__neutral Oh, by the  way.
__label__neutral Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.
__label__neutral Hi, Pheebs?
__label__neutral Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
__label__non-neutral What?!
__label__non-neutral Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England.
__label__neutral Which
__label__neutral How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
__label__neutral Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
__label__neutral Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
__label__joy Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which
__label__joy Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here
__label__anger You completely stole my answer!
__label__non-neutral Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
__label__anger Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
__label__neutral What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
__label__neutral I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
__label__neutral Would ya care to venture one?
__label__neutral Would
__label__anger Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
__label__neutral Are you just repeating what
__label__neutral All right, let's move on.
__label__neutral Okay then.
__label__neutral All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.
__label__neutral And-and when she comes in hopefully, she wont recognise you because, well, why would she?
__label__neutral Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.
__label__neutral You be Mr. Gonzalez, and Ill be uh, Mr. Wong.
__label__neutral Diverse.
__label__neutral Did anybody call for security?
__label__neutral You be cool.
__label__neutral Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk?  Hey, Joey?
__label__fear Wheres my ring? My dead grandmothers wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
__label__neutral Way to be cool, man.
__label__neutral Whats he talking about?
__label__non-neutral There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
__label__surprise Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
__label__anger We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
__label__surprise Okay, who are you?
__label__non-neutral The Hardy boys?
__label__anger Look, I dont need to steal some stupid ring, all right?
__label__anger I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
__label__neutral Marry me.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Joey!
__label__joy Hell yeah! Ill marry you!
__label__anger You cant marry him!
__label__non-neutral Hey lady, your days over! Its my turn!
__label__surprise Phoebe!
__label__surprise Why?! Why cant she marry me?!
__label__non-neutral I can and I will!
__label__neutral Shes not pregnant. Its Rachel. Rachels the one whos pregnant.
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral Phoebe I think he would notice if you didnt have a baby in nine months!
__label__surprise Its Joey!
__label__surprise Now I cant believe it! What? Rachels pregnant?  Whos the father?
__label__neutral We dont know.
__label__neutral Ohh I wonder if that dude.
__label__surprise Theres a dude?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__surprise Who? Who is it?
__label__disgust About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didnt see who it was but
__label__neutral Was that story over?
__label__neutral The guy left this.
__label__surprise Oh my God! I know who the father is
__label__non-neutral People have got to finish their stories!
__label__surprise Oh my God, youre back!
__label__surprise Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
__label__neutral Why do you want to see my hand?
__label__disgust I wanna see whats in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__disgust Eww! Oh, its all dirty. You should throw this out.
__label__anger No!
__label__non-neutral Me too!
__label__neutral Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, yknow?
__label__non-neutral Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we dont wanna look stupid!
__label__joy Alright were back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
__label__neutral Three, Two, One!
__label__neutral Cut!
__label__joy No! Year! Happy No Year!
__label__joy Okay, heres where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone thats a wrap!

__label__neutral I see. Yknow umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
__label__surprise No!
__label__neutral No, she doesnt.
__label__neutral Uh Phoebe, what she makesthats uhtheyre sock rabbits.
__label__anger They are completely differentOkay!
__label__surprise Okay!
__label__surprise Okay!
__label__non-neutral I didnt make it!
__label__sadness Im sorry!
__label__neutral I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that were supposed to
__label__neutral Oh, its okay. I dont
__label__non-neutral No-no, its not okay!
__label__non-neutral Its not!
__label__non-neutral I mean you were just Youre so incredible!
__label__non-neutral You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me!
__label__joy Yknow Im just gonnaI, I am gonna make this up to you!
__label__non-neutral I will!
__label__neutral I-I am going to
__label__neutral Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
__label__neutral No.  And then I called him, and he wasnt there.
__label__neutral Well, then hes, hes probably just, out.
__label__non-neutral Oh, thank you thats very helpful, Im glad you came over.
__label__neutral Hello.
__label__non-neutral Hi! Its me.
__label__joy Hi! Oh, Im so glad you called.

__label__neutral Nobody.

__label__neutral Is that Mark?
__label__neutral Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
__label__non-neutral Yeah! Got it!
__label__non-neutral Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
__label__non-neutral Ah, thats okay, thanks.
__label__neutral Hey, you dont have to smile. You just have to dance.
__label__non-neutral Look, I dont feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
__label__neutral Oh, okay.  Hey, two beers.
__label__neutral You wanna go in the bedroom? Its a little more comfortable.
__label__neutral Sure.
__label__surprise Okay.  Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
__label__surprise If this is your idea of sexy talk?
__label__non-neutral No seriously, yknow the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
__label__neutral What contracts?
__label__non-neutral Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I dont get.
__label__neutral Like what?
__label__disgust Yknow, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?
__label__anger Tag!
__label__anger Im serious!
__label__anger This isnt funny!
__label__anger Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
__label__surprise Rach, Im sorry, but you didnt give me any contracts!
__label__anger Yes I did! And I put a little
__label__neutral Im telling you, you never gave them to me.
__label__anger Yknow what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
__label__non-neutral No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are
__label__disgust Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
__label__neutral You wanna go down to the office right now?
__label__anger No! Come on its late, were not gonna go down to the office.
__label__neutral Okay I understand.  I wouldnt want to be proved wrong either.
__label__joy Okay get your coat!  Oh! When did you unhook this?  Nice work!
__label__neutral Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this    is my good friend Ross.
__label__neutral Nice to meet you.
__label__neutral Oh and I need to talk to you.
__label__neutral About what?
__label__neutral To see if know what these guys are talking about.
__label__neutral Pheebs, hows it going?
__label__neutral Im doing okay. I think its going well. Do you think theyre having fun? Am I talking to fast?
__label__joy Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, its going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
__label__neutral Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before?
__label__neutral Oh right, Coach Ruben.
__label__neutral Do you know what Pheebs?
__label__fear When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
__label__neutral Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
__label__neutral See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
__label__surprise What do you mean?
__label__anger Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
__label__anger Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
__label__surprise Uh, what was that?
__label__neutral Uh,
__label__neutral ...I'm, I'm okay.
__label__neutral That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Bye.
__label__joy Whoo-hoo!
__label__joy Yeah, there you go!
__label__joy Second date!
__label__neutral ...I dunno.
__label__neutral You
__label__non-neutral Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay?
__label__disgust I mean,... how needy is that?
__label__neutral Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
__label__joy You're so pretty.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Hey, Phoebe.
__label__neutral Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
__label__surprise You talked to him. Are you crazy?
__label__joy Thank you, Happy Holidays.
__label__anger Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't  Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
__label__non-neutral Hey!!
__label__fear The charity's on fire!
__label__fear Help!
__label__joy Oh good!
__label__joy Thank you, I need that.
__label__surprise Whoa!
__label__surprise What is that?!
__label__surprise It's nine o'clock in the morning!
__label__neutral Can I help you?
__label__neutral Uh yeah, where-wheres the guy who decides whos pictures go up on the wall?
__label__neutral Hes not here right now.
__label__anger Oh, youre kidding me!
__label__neutral All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral Im an actor; Im kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
__label__neutral Yknow, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
__label__neutral Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  Youre the other one right?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
__label__surprise What?! Youre crazy! Theres nothing sexual about the noises I make!
__label__surprise Really?
__label__non-neutral Theres nothing sexual about this?
__label__non-neutral Oooh.
__label__non-neutral Oo God!
__label__non-neutral Ohh.
__label__non-neutral Ohhhh.
__label__non-neutral Ohh.
__label__non-neutral What are you looking at?!
__label__neutral I mean hi.
__label__non-neutral Oh myThis is so embarrassing. Oh my God, Im never gonna get massaged again!
__label__non-neutral No, you cant let this stop you from getting massages!
__label__neutral No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Well not clients, lovers. But lets just yknow, try it again. Come back and-and well work through it.
__label__surprise Are you sure?
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__neutral I guess.
__label__joy Great! Okay, if youll just excuse me.  So, did you hear something you liked?
__label__non-neutral Noo!!!
__label__non-neutral Yes!
__label__non-neutral Noo!!
__label__non-neutral Yes!!
__label__fear Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk!  That they know of.
__label__neutral Okay, heres the thing. Were gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that youre drunk.
__label__non-neutral Really?! You promise?
__label__neutral Yeah, Ill take care of it.
__label__joy Okay. I love you so much.
__label__neutral Okay we have to do something about your breath.
__label__surprise What about
__label__neutral Thats still yours. Okay, now remember its a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
__label__neutral Okay. I can do that.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__surprise Surprise!!!
__label__neutral Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.
__label__neutral Yeah, were done.
__label__surprise Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
__label__joy Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
__label__joy Sweet!
__label__neutral All right, well finish your coffee; lets go.
__label__disgust Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
__label__neutral Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight.
__label__non-neutral I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
__label__sadness Im sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby
__label__neutral So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
__label__non-neutral Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.
__label__neutral Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
__label__joy She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
__label__joy Oh, what a fun office.
__label__neutral I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.
__label__neutral So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
__label__neutral Rachel? Do you smoke?
__label__neutral Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror storiesabout ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral Peach pit.
__label__neutral Yes, Bunny?
__label__neutral Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
__label__neutral -Peaches?
__label__neutral Actually, nectarines, but basically...
__label__neutral Could've been a peach.
__label__neutral Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.
__label__non-neutral Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!  What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
__label__joy All right!
__label__joy Westminster Abbey!
__label__joy Hands down, best Abbey Ive ever seen.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
__label__neutral I think its great. Its great. Yknow, theyre thinking of changing the name of this place.
__label__surprise Really? To what?
__label__non-neutral To Put the Camera Away!!!
__label__neutral Man,
__label__surprise Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And
__label__neutral Chandler, theres a guy right over there.
__label__surprise Thats a mailman! Thats
__label__neutral Chandler, dont worry! This doesnt make you any less of a guy!
__label__neutral Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
__label__neutral Hmm.
__label__non-neutral Eh..., I dont, I dont know.
__label__neutral What?
__label__non-neutral Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
__label__neutral Rachel?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
__label__non-neutral Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
__label__neutral Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
__label__non-neutral Eh, do you believe that?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__non-neutral Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
__label__neutral No, you said the baby creeps you out.
__label__non-neutral No, the little girl creeps me out.
__label__neutral You said the baby.
__label__non-neutral Why would the baby creep me out?
__label__non-neutral Why would the little girl creep you out?
__label__neutral You guys, Im sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
__label__surprise This is going in your book?
__label__joy Yeah, its about relationships. Yknow? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
__label__surprise What?! Excuse me!
__label__neutral And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.
__label__neutral And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as its a compliment.
__label__joy Yeah!!!!
__label__joy Yes, I made it!
__label__joy Im on time!
__label__neutral Okay, why dont we all uh,  open our books to page 23.
__label__neutral Where  Where you will seea uha bunch of uhred spots.
__label__neutral Okay,  umm, why dont, why dont you all start to read, while I
__label__non-neutral Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
__label__non-neutral Ross! What are you I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
__label__neutral Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
__label__surprise What the? What
__label__non-neutral Hi!
__label__neutral Miss? May I help you?
__label__non-neutral Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay?
__label__neutral But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.
__label__sadness So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
__label__neutral It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
__label__neutral Do you want me to be afraid of you?
__label__neutral Of course not.
__label__joy I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.
__label__non-neutral I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Of course!
__label__non-neutral Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
__label__neutral All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit
__label__anger Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is
__label__disgust A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
__label__non-neutral Ooh, it's not a toy.
__label__sadness Well, I don't know what else to do.
__label__non-neutral I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!
__label__non-neutral So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!
__label__non-neutral 'Cause I-I got nothing!
__label__non-neutral All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.
__label__neutral Okay then.
__label__neutral Here we go.
__label__non-neutral Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?
__label__neutral Ask again later.
__label__anger Later is not good enough.
__label__neutral Ask again later.
__label__anger What the hell!
__label__anger This is broken!
__label__anger It-it is broken!
__label__neutral All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
__label__neutral Excuse me.
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Are you Phoebe Buffay?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy Can-can I get your autograph, Im your biggest fan.
__label__neutral I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
__label__joy Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
__label__non-neutral No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
__label__neutral Come on, two on one.
__label__surprise What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
__label__surprise What, now?
__label__joy Yes, now is when you swoop!
__label__joy You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not!
__label__non-neutral You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
__label__neutral My Catholic friend is right.
__label__neutral She's distraught.
__label__neutral You're there for her.
__label__joy You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
__label__neutral Well, I just called Joshua
__label__non-neutral Oh, how did it go?
__label__neutral Well, I did my best to convince him that Im not some crazy girl who is dying to get marriedIm just going through a hard time.
__label__neutral What did he say?
__label__non-neutral Well uh, his answering machine was
__label__non-neutral Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that hes gonna call you again.
__label__sadness Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care.
__label__sadness I dont think hes the one Im sad about.
__label__sadness Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well.
__label__sadness Yeah, maybe.
__label__sadness And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
__label__non-neutral Any luck?
__label__sadness Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?
__label__sadness I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
__label__non-neutral Again. Yknow what? I think we all did.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__surprise I dont get it!
__label__non-neutral It was in my room all night!
__label__non-neutral And if she didnt take it, and I didnt take it; and you  didnt take it, then who did?
__label__anger Shh!
__label__anger Were trying to think!
__label__neutral This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__joy Oh yeah!
__label__neutral I got in there myself once.
__label__neutral My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldnt, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral It was funny til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
__label__neutral No, you, you cant fit in that thing. Thats not deep enough.
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah?  If I cant, Ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
__label__neutral All right, you have yourself a deal.
__label__surprise Okay.  See?! I told ya!
__label__non-neutral Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
__label__neutral Hey! Whats up?
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__joy Hey-hey, whos your friend?  Hey!!
__label__joy Hey Joey!
__label__joy Erin! Still here!
__label__joy Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
__label__joy Why wouldnt ya? Erin is great! Then-then theres you guys.
__label__joy Ohh, listen. Ive got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
__label__non-neutral I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
__label__neutral Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__surprise Ohh!
__label__neutral Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral I mean you definitely should do that.
__label__joy Y'know what, I should do it.
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
__label__neutral Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__non-neutral Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
__label__anger This woman's living my life.
__label__surprise What?
__label__anger She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!
__label__non-neutral Look at this, look.
__label__non-neutral She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.
__label__non-neutral She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.
__label__non-neutral She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
__label__neutral You're not an artist.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
__label__surprise I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
__label__non-neutral No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
__label__neutral I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
__label__non-neutral Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
__label__surprise I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
__label__disgust Oh, that is so sick.
__label__disgust I feel violated. And not in a good way.
__label__surprise How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
__label__joy Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
__label__non-neutral I know. My arm is killing me.
__label__neutral No, I meant with the dropper over here.
__label__anger Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm
__label__neutral Hey Rach, can you pass me the
__label__neutral Yep!
__label__joy Go!!
__label__surprise What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral Okay! Okay! Okay!  We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
__label__joy Oh, thanks, thanks.
__label__neutral So Monica tells me that uh, you dont want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent.
__label__neutral Is that true?
__label__neutral Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
__label__neutral Pheebs
__label__non-neutral Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
__label__non-neutral What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here.
__label__neutral Whats the matter?
__label__neutral Nothing.
__label__non-neutral What is it? Hey!
__label__sadness Really its nothing. Im just
__label__neutral Rach come on, what?
__label__sadness Ive just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
__label__surprise What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
__label__sadness Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
__label__neutral Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
__label__sadness Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right?
__label__neutral Yeah, I guess so.
__label__sadness I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
__label__surprise Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?!
__label__joy I just found out this is Chandlers office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!
__label__non-neutral Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
__label__anger We said seven!
__label__anger We said six!
__label__neutral The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.
__label__anger Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!"
__label__joy Hi!
__label__disgust Oh my good God.
__label__disgust Ugh!
__label__non-neutral I know what time you said.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
__label__anger You, get out of my shop!
__label__surprise Well, what did he do?
__label__anger He went out with my wife!
__label__surprise Joey!
__label__non-neutral Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-IHey! I did
__label__anger Thats my wife!!! Get out!
__label__neutral Well, we should go.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport.
__label__neutral Oh please.
__label__non-neutral Every moment is precious.
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__non-neutral Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.
__label__neutral Well, were really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
__label__non-neutral On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane.
__label__non-neutral No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.
__label__neutral Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
__label__neutral Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
__label__neutral So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.
__label__neutral We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
__label__joy Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.
__label__surprise Yeah?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Just go for it Chandler.
__label__neutral Yeah, you should.
__label__neutral Yeah, you should, really.
__label__neutral Go on.
__label__neutral All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. But Im just doing it for you guys.
__label__non-neutral : Im sure as hell a dancer, its no use Marge will never go for me.
__label__non-neutral Come on Treeger, dont say that.
__label__neutral You just ahh, you just need more practice.
__label__neutral Here, come on, lets ahh, lets try it again.
__label__neutral Come on.
__label__non-neutral Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.
__label__non-neutral I mean, yknow, Im not really that comfortable dancing with a We-he!!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral : Yeah!
__label__neutral Oh, I
__label__neutral Are you sure? Ill bet theres another flight to Minsk in like
__label__neutral July. Umm,
__label__non-neutral Thats really beautiful. What does it mean?
__label__neutral Please, clean my beakers. I dont get out of the lab much.
__label__non-neutral Thats good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
__label__neutral Yeah, I Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldnt because yknow, Ihave to leave.
__label__non-neutral Youre right! Youre right. Dont say it.
__label__non-neutral I-I do though.
__label__non-neutral I do too.
__label__neutral Bye Phoebe.
__label__non-neutral Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__surprise Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that?
__label__non-neutral Listen, Im gettin something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
__label__neutral No, I do not hear that.
__label__joy Yeah, I-I heard.  I think its great!  Ohh, Im so happy for you!
__label__joy Oh, well, thats great!
__label__joy Yeah! Yeah!
__label__joy I cant believe youre getting married!
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Monica and Rachel made out.
__label__surprise Ohhh!
__label__surprise Why are we in bed together?
__label__neutral I dont know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral No!
__label__fear But we-we didnt havesex-uh, did we?
__label__neutral I mean, I dont remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
__label__joy Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
__label__neutral And we didnt have sex.
__label__neutral Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. Im just glad we didnt do anything stupid.
__label__neutral Tell me about it.
__label__neutral What are we gonna do?
__label__neutral I say we go with
__label__neutral Chandler?
__label__neutral Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
__label__non-neutral Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
__label__disgust Whats that smell?
__label__non-neutral I know!
__label__neutral Hi, remember us?
__label__neutral Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a
__label__neutral I am. I'm
__label__neutral Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
__label__sadness Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
__label__neutral Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
__label__neutral Yknow what? It
__label__neutral Sorry.
__label__joy Im so exited!
__label__joy Ive been waiting for this for months!
__label__joy I got my hair coloured!
__label__joy I got new sheets!
__label__joy Im making him a
__label__neutral Um-hmm.
__label__neutral What am I making him by the way?
__label__neutral Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
__label__surprise I thought I was making him filet mignon?
__label__neutral Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.
__label__non-neutral And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
__label__surprise Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
__label__non-neutral Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!
__label__non-neutral Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated.
__label__neutral Yknow its like uh, Biology!
__label__non-neutral Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
__label__neutral Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.
__label__non-neutral Phoebe!
__label__neutral If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes probably not gay.
__label__neutral You are falling fast asleep.
__label__neutral Deeper.
__label__neutral Deeper.
__label__neutral Deeper.
__label__neutral You are now completely asleep.
__label__neutral You dont need to smoke.
__label__neutral Cigarettes dont control you.
__label__neutral You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
__label__neutral A strong, confident woman.
__label__neutral Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller.
__label__joy Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
__label__neutral Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
__label__non-neutral Of course not.
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
__label__neutral So how are things going with Paul?
__label__joy Good.
__label__non-neutral Although yknow, he-hes a private guy.
__label__sadness Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
__label__neutral Thats easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wont open.
__label__surprise So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
__label__neutral No thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
__label__neutral Hi honey.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__fear Okay, Ben, I wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident.
__label__surprise Monica, number one, I dont think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!
__label__neutral You said number two.
__label__neutral I also said number one.
__label__neutral Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
__label__neutral Cant I just look at the handles on them?
__label__neutral You would think.
__label__neutral Okay, fine.
__label__non-neutral Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why Im a terrible waitress?
__label__neutral Because, I dont care.
__label__neutral I dont care.
__label__non-neutral I dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I dont care where the tray spot is, I just dont care, this is not what I want to do.
__label__non-neutral So I dont think I should do it anymore.
__label__non-neutral Im gonna give you my weeks notice.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral Gunther, I quit.
__label__surprise Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee?
__label__non-neutral Ohh, I mean its just so realistic!
__label__neutral I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.
__label__joy Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
__label__neutral Do you uh, do youready for a refill?
__label__surprise Oh, I probably shouldntso I will!  Oh! Wow! Its like its raining!
__label__joy Pretty cool, huh?
__label__neutral But if youre thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldnt get sucked up into the mechanism, well youd be wrong.
__label__neutral Umm, can I use your bathroom?
__label__neutral Its uh, right through there.
__label__non-neutral Okay.  God yknow, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbianis apartment
__label__joy Yeah, lifes pretty great isnt it?
__label__joy Yeah, it sure is!
__label__neutral You know, I think I was sixteen.
__label__neutral Please, just a little bit off the back.
__label__neutral I'm still on "no."
__label__neutral Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
__label__anger No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.
__label__neutral What's goin' on?
__label__neutral Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
__label__non-neutral What stupid thing did you do?
__label__disgust Ewww!
__label__neutral I know.
__label__neutral See, yes.
__label__neutral Thats Yasmine Bleeth, shes a completely different kind of chick.
__label__neutral I love you both.
__label__neutral But in very different ways.
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__neutral (sees hes watching
__label__non-neutral I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
__label__non-neutral If they cant find a home for her, they kill her! And Im not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
__label__non-neutral Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
__label__disgust Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of other animals!
__label__disgust Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
__label__joy Thanks, Im glad you see it that way.
__label__joy Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
__label__neutral So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
__label__non-neutral Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
__label__neutral So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
__label__neutral Ohh, he's really shy. I-I dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
__label__neutral Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
__label__non-neutral I dont care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
__label__surprise Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?
__label__neutral I might've said that.  Why is that funny?
__label__joy Because I'm very happy for him!  And
__label__non-neutral Hi!
__label__neutral All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral All right, let's go say good-bye.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__anger Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?
__label__disgust Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
__label__surprise Fish!
__label__neutral It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
__label__sadness Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here
__label__joy Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
__label__joy We did have fun, didn't we?
__label__joy We did!
__label__neutral Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
__label__joy Oh, I would love to!
__label__joy Yay, okay!
__label__joy Good, good, good, good, good.
__label__neutral Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
__label__neutral Um...  Done!
__label__surprise Youre, hey, youre not paying for the pizza!
__label__neutral Oh come on, its only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
__label__neutral Ahh, Id throw another thousand on that.
__label__neutral Why, how much is that?
__label__neutral Thats about 60 cents.
__label__neutral Okay, its coffee.
__label__surprise Ice coffee? Tell me its ice coffee!
__label__neutral Its-its hot
__label__surprise Hot coffee!!!
__label__anger You idiot!!
__label__anger You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!
__label__anger What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?!
__label__non-neutral Huh?
__label__anger !
__label__neutral Whats your favourite thing about summertime?
__label__neutral Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
__label__neutral Yeah
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__joy Tommyyyy! Say, whats your favourite thing about summer?
__label__neutral Ooh, I dont know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
__label__non-neutral Ohh, thats a good one.
__label__neutral OK, try this salmon mousse.
__label__joy Mmmm. Good.
__label__neutral Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
__label__non-neutral It's creamier.
__label__neutral Yeah, well, is that
__label__disgust I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
__label__surprise My God! What happened to you?
__label__disgust Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?
__label__non-neutral "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
__label__joy That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
__label__non-neutral Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really
__label__non-neutral Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
__label__joy Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
__label__neutral Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
__label__neutral I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
__label__non-neutral Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
__label__neutral Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
__label__neutral I don't see why not.
__label__neutral Here's my retainer!
__label__neutral Someone in there?
__label__non-neutral No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.
__label__surprise Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
__label__neutral Someone was in the lady's room, I couldnt wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
__label__neutral Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, Im-Im talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name.
__label__neutral Ginger.
__label__neutral Ginger. Im talking to Ginger, so....
__label__neutral Dont you have to use the bathroom?
__label__neutral Nope, nope, Id just ah, Id rather talk to you.
__label__neutral Yes, I do.
__label__neutral Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
__label__neutral Someone in here.
__label__anger Im going to keep dating him Mother, and theres nothing you can do about it!
__label__anger Oh yes there is!
__label__anger What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
__label__anger That was an accident! And so were you.
__label__anger Well, at least Im not a murderer!
__label__non-neutral Oh, my baby!
__label__surprise That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
__label__neutral Oh, just years of experience.
__label__non-neutral Can I get some ice here?!
__label__joy Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
__label__non-neutral Youre not the fan whos dying are you?
__label__surprise Say what?
__label__neutral Im supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying, but thats not supposed to be until  later!
__label__non-neutral No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-Im the guy in the coma!
__label__surprise Oh that was a real person?!
__label__non-neutral An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
__label__surprise I-I-Im leaving the show?
__label__neutral I dont know. Why? Did you hear something?
__label__surprise Who told you that?
__label__non-neutral Oh uh, one of the writers.
__label__surprise Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
__label__neutral Umm
__label__neutral Feel better?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy Much!
__label__non-neutral Listen uh, not that Im yknow insecure about my manhood or anything yknow, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
__label__neutral Yeah, I understand.
__label__joy Yeah! Okay!  Hey! Hi!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__surprise Yknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
__label__neutral I dont think so.
__label__non-neutral Oh! Maybe its because Im on television. Im an actor on
__label__surprise Wow!
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Hm-mmm.
__label__neutral $4.50 please.
__label__neutral Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.
__label__neutral Alright, alright, alright.
__label__non-neutral It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word.
__label__non-neutral Oh God, do something.
__label__non-neutral Just make contact, smile!
__label__joy There you go!
__label__non-neutral You're definitely scaring here.
__label__neutral Would you like to call somebody?
__label__neutral Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.
__label__anger Okay! Feel free to look, but Im telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
__label__neutral Oh
__label__neutral Its my sister.
__label__neutral Okay, very cute braces. Anyway yknow what, the
__label__non-neutral So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
__label__neutral In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a
__label__neutral Phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, she doesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know that youve been living with your Grandmothers for a week now.
__label__neutral Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__sadness Im never gonna find a roommate, ever.
__label__neutral Why, nobody good?
__label__disgust Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural.
__label__disgust The spitter.
__label__non-neutral Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.
__label__neutral Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing
__label__neutral So how many more do you have tomorrow?
__label__neutral Two.
__label__neutral This photographer, who seemed really dull.
__label__neutral And this actor guy, who Im not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone Chandler Bing, he said Whoa-whoa, short message.
__label__neutral Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
__label__non-neutral Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
__label__neutral Umm, hows it going with you guys?
__label__neutral Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
__label__surprise Oh, really?
__label__joy Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesnt really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think its gonna make a difference
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hi!
__label__non-neutral What-what are-what are these?
__label__joy Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought theyd brighten up the place. They do dont you think?
__label__non-neutral No-no-no, no!
__label__neutral Well, how-how come?
__label__neutral Thats just the way it is.
__label__surprise Thats crazy.
__label__neutral Maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.
__label__neutral See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now Peter!
__label__neutral Hey, Peter!
__label__neutral Its me Rhonda!
__label__neutral From PS-129!
__label__non-neutral I shared my puddin which you man!
__label__neutral I gave you my
__label__neutral I-I think everybodys pretending they dont hear you.
__label__neutral Anyway, look, I dont know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, Im telling you, he
__label__neutral Thats okay, Im cool over here. Ill catch up with you later, Joey.
__label__neutral Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.
__label__neutral Hows that coffee comin, dear?
__label__neutral Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
__label__neutral Im not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
__label__non-neutral I know!
__label__surprise Ill bet your thinking, Whats an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee? Eh?
__label__neutral Op.
__label__non-neutral Eh.
__label__neutral Oh, you got me.
__label__neutral Well, dont think I havent noticed your potential.
__label__neutral Well, Ive got a project for you thats a lot more related to fashion.
__label__neutral How does that sound?
__label__joy Oh, that sounds great.
__label__neutral Come on over here, sweetheart.
__label__joy Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
__label__fear Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe youd want to get back together?
__label__neutral No. But thanks.
__label__sadness Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
__label__neutral Okay. No. But thanks.
__label__neutral Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
__label__surprise Wow, that was kinda brutal.
__label__neutral Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.
__label__neutral Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, yknow.
__label__neutral Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,
__label__neutral Yeah, sure.
__label__surprise Wow.
__label__neutral I'm, I'm really sorry.
__label__neutral Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
__label__surprise Relieved?
__label__neutral Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
__label__neutral She wants
__label__anger Oh my God! If you say that one more time,
__label__anger Fine!
__label__anger Fine!
__label__anger But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  If you accept full responsibility...  Full responsibility!
__label__anger ...I can begin to trust you again.
__label__anger Does that seem like something you can do.
__label__anger Does it?!
__label__anger !
__label__surprise No?
__label__neutral Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel.
__label__neutral If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
__label__sadness Yeah, I know.
__label__sadness I mean, no, youre right.
__label__neutral Yeah I guess Ill let it go.
__label__sadness But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
__label__neutral Sure, its hard to forget!
__label__neutral But that doesnt mean you have to talk about it!
__label__neutral A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.
__label__surprise What the hell happened on that beach?!
__label__neutral Its between us and the sea, Ross!
__label__non-neutral I didnt think you were gay. I do now.
__label__neutral See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
__label__sadness Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious.
__label__neutral Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
__label__surprise Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
__label__neutral Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
__label__joy Oh wow! Im free for her!
__label__surprise Oh, wait a second! I didnt say I wasnt free!
__label__neutral Hey, Chandler, why dont we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
__label__neutral Hold on, yknow I
__label__non-neutral Oh well, thats uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
__label__neutral Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
__label__neutral Well, I dont really know what that is, but
__label__neutral Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
__label__neutral Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
__label__disgust Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
__label__surprise What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
__label__neutral What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
__label__anger Joey, get out of the fridge.
__label__non-neutral All right, all right.
__label__surprise What is that?
__label__neutral For the ride.
__label__neutral Yeah, like in a cab...
__label__neutral Save it.
__label__disgust Okay, hating this.
__label__neutral Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
__label__joy I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
__label__disgust That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
__label__non-neutral All right, I'm going. I'm going.
__label__neutral Here we go, here we go.
__label__neutral Rossy, Rossy.
__label__non-neutral WHAT IS IT?!
__label__non-neutral Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
__label__neutral Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
__label__neutral Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
__label__non-neutral Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Calling from Rome!
__label__neutral So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
__label__non-neutral Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome.  I'm talking to Rome.
__label__non-neutral Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
__label__non-neutral So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
__label__non-neutral Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
__label__surprise You know it?
__label__neutral Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
__label__neutral Oh, sure, they love us over there.
__label__joy Ben! Ben! Ben!
__label__anger Gimme em!
__label__anger No! They are mine!
__label__anger You stole them from me!
__label__anger You stole them from me!!
__label__anger Gimme them!
__label__neutral You just wanna each take one?
__label__neutral Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
__label__non-neutral Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
__label__neutral Well
__label__neutral Why dont you phase it out?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think youre, yknow, that youre adjusting to life in America.
__label__neutral Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean theyre probably not even listening!
__label__surprise Theyre not listening too me?
__label__neutral Of course theyre listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
__label__non-neutral Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
__label__neutral I think you look fine.
__label__neutral How about Joey... Pepponi?
__label__neutral No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
__label__neutral Joey... Switzerland?
__label__neutral Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.
__label__non-neutral Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.
__label__neutral Which I'm not.
__label__non-neutral Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
__label__neutral Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
__label__neutral Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
__label__non-neutral Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
__label__neutral Might wanna try Joseph.
__label__non-neutral Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
__label__joy Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
__label__surprise Are you kidding?
__label__neutral Okay, look.
__label__non-neutral I-I studied evolution.
__label__non-neutral Remember, evolution?
__label__non-neutral Monkey into man?
__label__neutral Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey.
__label__non-neutral Im Doctor Monkey!
__label__neutral Im not arguing with that.
__label__non-neutral All right, Ive heard enough. Ive made my decision.
__label__disgust You are both idiots.
__label__disgust The joke is not funny, and its offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys!
__label__anger You shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!
__label__anger Now let it go!
__label__anger The joke sucks!
__label__neutral Its your joke.
__label__anger Is not.
__label__non-neutral Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
__label__joy I didnt!
__label__neutral Even when I found outumm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
__label__non-neutral Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
__label__surprise Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
__label__neutral Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and

__label__joy Yes!
__label__anger Then don't touch one!!
__label__surprise Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy Thanks!
__label__neutral All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
__label__joy Done!
__label__non-neutral And it can't be Joey.
__label__neutral It's not.
__label__neutral Or Joseph.
__label__non-neutral Oh.
__label__neutral Hi!
__label__joy Hi! Hey, Pete youre back! Hey, check this out.
__label__joy Wow! Skates!
__label__surprise Wow! Youre a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was youre trip?
__label__neutral Well...
__label__non-neutral Oh, whatd ya bring me?!
__label__non-neutral Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan.
__label__joy Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection.
__label__neutral You want some coffee?
__label__neutral Yeah, sure, thatd be great.
__label__neutral Regular or decaf?
__label__neutral Ah, which ever is closest.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral So ask me what I did today.
__label__neutral So what did you do today Pete?
__label__joy I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
__label__surprise What?! Oh.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Where've you been?
__label__neutral At the vet.
__label__fear She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
__label__non-neutral She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
__label__joy Hey! He beat ya.
__label__sadness She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
__label__neutral So what does this mean?
__label__sadness I'm gonna have to give him up.
__label__anger Aww man! I cant believe I locked myself out again!
__label__non-neutral Hang on buddy!
__label__surprise Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
__label__neutral I sure did.
__label__surprise But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
__label__non-neutral Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
__label__neutral May I come in?
__label__neutral Uh, yeah, if you want too.
__label__neutral Do
__label__neutral Yeah, sure?
__label__neutral So do I.
__label__neutral Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.
__label__neutral This is just about tonight.
__label__neutral I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us."
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__non-neutral I just want this to be  about what it is!
__label__non-neutral And um, what-what is that Ross?
__label__joy The physical act of love.
__label__surprise What?! Are you crazy?
__label__surprise Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
__label__surprise Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
__label__non-neutral You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
__label__non-neutral Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
__label__non-neutral No! No!  No!  No-no-no-no.
__label__surprise Ohh wow! Im sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
__label__neutral Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
__label__fear It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's gonna kill me.
__label__neutral Yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there.
__label__neutral Ah Joey.
__label__neutral Joey Tribbiani.
__label__neutral Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
__label__non-neutral So, does that mean the audition is off?
__label__neutral Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Aw come on Joey, it's easy.
__label__neutral Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
__label__non-neutral It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
__label__neutral Have fun.
__label__neutral Bye.
__label__surprise Wow! Fortunately she has a
__label__surprise Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
__label__surprise Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!
__label__surprise !
__label__neutral Hi there.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__neutral Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!
__label__neutral So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
__label__anger Oh, DAMN IT!
__label__neutral Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
__label__neutral Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__neutral Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
__label__non-neutral Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
__label__non-neutral We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
__label__joy Yeah! C'mon!
__label__neutral Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
__label__neutral Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
__label__neutral No, she's at a faculty meeting.
__label__neutral Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...
__label__neutral Come in.
__label__neutral Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
__label__neutral What's it look like?
__label__neutral Kinda like a big face without skin.
__label__neutral Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
__label__surprise Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
__label__neutral Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
__label__joy Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
__label__neutral Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
__label__surprise The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
__label__non-neutral What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
__label__surprise You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
__label__neutral I have no idea what you just said.
__label__neutral Put Joey on the phone.
__label__non-neutral What's up man?
__label__fear I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth
__label__non-neutral Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Chandler, listen.
__label__neutral Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
__label__neutral and that was all before 10 oclock.
__label__neutral The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.
__label__neutral And then the florist phoned to say there arent any tulips.
__label__neutral Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.
__label__neutral Were not gonna be
__label__surprise Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?
__label__anger Well, up yours too!
__label__neutral Wheres Chandler?
__label__surprise Ah, he cant make it, he said he had to his...  Whoa-oh!
__label__neutral Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
__label__neutral Joey I can see you okay? Youre hiding behind the coats.
__label__neutral Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
__label__non-neutral Well, if you dont have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
__label__joy Yeah! You wanna come?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Fine.
__label__neutral Fine.
__label__neutral Fine.
__label__neutral Fine.
__label__neutral All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral Whats the matter?
__label__disgust Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
__label__surprise Oh Willies still alive!
__label__neutral What are you guys doing?
__label__non-neutral Oh, my mom called, theyre gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so were looking for a good picture of us.
__label__neutral Oooh, Im afraid that does not exist.
__label__surprise Thats not true, there are great pictures of us!
__label__neutral No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whos going like this
__label__surprise Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the
__label__sadness I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture.
__label__joy Oh, heres a great one.
__label__neutral Yeah, Im not in that.
__label__joy I know, but look at me: all tan.
__label__neutral Hey, why dont you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.
__label__joy Thats a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Yknow
__label__neutral Yeah thats great! Next to that, Chandler wont look so stupid.
__label__neutral Chandler what do you say?
__label__neutral All right, but I should warn you, Im not going. Im going.
surprise	Why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?

neutral	It didnt.
joy	Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what Ive got with Alice.

disgust	Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!
non-neutral	Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I dont have time!
neutral	Theyre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.

neutral	What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
neutral	So why dont you give me your number?

neutral	Oh.
neutral	And its not fake, its totally brutal.
neutral	Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Theyre

non-neutral	What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
non-neutral	Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
joy	Well, that makes me feel so good.
neutral	It was just so awkward and bumpy.
surprise	Bumpy?
neutral	Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.
neutral	And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
non-neutral	Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
non-neutral	Coming through!  Oh! Coming through!  Oh! Hello! Hi!  No! Right! Coming through!
neutral	Oh well, its not so bad.
sadness	Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
surprise	Oh!
surprise	My God!
neutral	Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
surprise	Excuse me?
non-neutral	Joey! Hes working!  You would look
non-neutral	Oh, how bad is it?
sadness	Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that isnt burned is an ass. Which I do
neutral	Hows your room Rach?
sadness	Everythings ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
neutral	Isnt that mine?
non-neutral	Fine! Im sorry for your loss!
neutral	So uh, youre not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
non-neutral	Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am
neutral	Yes, they can stay with us.
neutral	Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
non-neutral	Theres just so much pressure.
neutral	I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.
neutral	I dont know if youd understand.
neutral	Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
non-neutral	Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!
neutral	Well, yknow.
fear	I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time.
neutral	So Im gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on.
neutral	Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	Whats all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
neutral	Ross, we can handle this.
sadness	Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.
anger	I mean, enough of the silliness!
anger	Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!
non-neutral	Okay-okay!
non-neutral	Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together.
non-neutral	Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?
non-neutral	That is so silly.
neutral	Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
neutral	Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
joy	Love is the best medicine.
non-neutral	Thats laughter.
neutral	Why do you do it?
neutral	I dont know.
neutral	Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
neutral	Yeah, I do.
neutral	And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, dont ya?
neutral	Yes.
joy	Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
neutral	Oh.
neutral	But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
neutral	Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
surprise	You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
neutral	Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.
non-neutral	Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!
non-neutral	Define me!
non-neutral	Love me, I need love!
neutral	'.
surprise	Have you really done this before?
joy	Yeah!
joy	Yeah!
joy	Yeah!
neutral	You just take a big, big swing.
neutral	Now, dont hold back.
neutral	and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
joy	Hey!
joy	Hey-hey-hey!
neutral	What are you doing?
joy	Were just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
neutral	Oh, all right.
joy	Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
non-neutral	Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
joy	Okay!
neutral	All right.
neutral	Bye!
neutral	Bye!
non-neutral	Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
neutral	Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey.
neutral	Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
neutral	Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
surprise	Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one!
neutral	Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials?
non-neutral	Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down?
neutral	Because we can remember them.
non-neutral	Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
neutral	Hey. When you guys were kids and you played
neutral	I was always Joanne.
neutral	Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! the war cry of your neighbourhood?
disgust	Ewww! Oh! Its the Mattress King!
non-neutral	Booo!!
disgust	Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
joy	Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
anger	What a wank!
anger	Oh, I cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses.
non-neutral	I know!
non-neutral	And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.
non-neutral	And Im appalled for you by the way.
non-neutral	You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it alone.
disgust	Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my food.
anger	Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
disgust	Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
neutral	Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
fear	Im, Im freaking out!
fear	Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have!
neutral	All right, I havent lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.
neutral	Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
neutral	Um. yeah.
neutral	I am
neutral	All right, look, heres the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.
neutral	So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
non-neutral	Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work.
neutral	Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but thats why you have got to be the bigger man here.
non-neutral	Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me!
non-neutral	Like me tiny doctor!
non-neutral	Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
non-neutral	Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along.
anger	Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.
non-neutral	Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna have to have a separate room for you too!
anger	!
neutral	Okay, okay, okay.  Ill get the bagels.
neutral	Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
neutral	All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
neutral	Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
surprise	Really? A purse?
non-neutral	It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
neutral	It looks like a women's purse.
neutral	No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,
neutral	See look,
neutral	Exactly! Unisex!
neutral	Maybe you need sex.
non-neutral	No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
neutral	Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
neutral	So, um, have you told your parents?
neutral	No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
neutral	Here you go.
neutral	You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.
neutral	.
neutral	.
non-neutral	no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.
joy	I love you Phoebe.
surprise	So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
joy	Hey!

non-neutral	Yeah, it did.
sadness	So, I guess this is over.
neutral	What?
sadness	Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
non-neutral	Why, exactly?
sadness	Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
surprise	Chandler that's crazy!
anger	If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!
neutral	So, this isn't over?
joy	You are so cute!
non-neutral	No.
neutral	No, it was a fight.
non-neutral	You deal with it and move on!
neutral	It's nothing to freak out about.

non-neutral	Y'know what I didnt wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? Youre not my girlfriend anymore so...
neutral	Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
neutral	Right.
non-neutral	Now that youre on youre own, youre free to look as stupid as you like.
neutral	You like it right?
neutral	Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! Im kidding!
neutral	Yeah, come here!
neutral	What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
neutral	Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!

non-neutral	And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
anger	All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.

neutral	You cant ask us son, thats cheating.
neutral	Youre right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
neutral	Well, he better not come by here. He cant see the bride in the wedding dress.
non-neutral	As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
neutral	But that was after the wedding, its not bad luck then.
neutral	Honey, it isnt good luck.
surprise	Oh my God! Monica!

neutral	Great. Hes doing great. Dont you worry about Chandler.
neutral	Are you okay?

neutral	But Rachel has an apartment.
neutral	Yeah, but when the baby comes shes gonna want to move.
surprise	She is?
surprise	Yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you?
neutral	I guess I didnt really think about it.
non-neutral	Ezel!  Hey Gunther! Youre an ezel!
anger	Damnit!
surprise	Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people?
neutral	Little village people.
joy	Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
joy	Oh, that is so sweet!
joy	I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
neutral	Huh. Except, Phoebes not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
sadness	Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies.
sadness	Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
surprise	Wait a minute!
joy	Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after shes done being pregnant.
neutral	Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
joy	Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants shes always wanted!
joy	Oh, shes gonna love that!
neutral	Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
neutral	Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
neutral	So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
anger	Fine, Im mentally unstable.
neutral	And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Uh yes, heroin and crack.
anger	Crack isnt even an intravenous drug!
neutral	Well, you would know.
neutral	Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
non-neutral	Oh, come on!
non-neutral	Ross, please, I found the magazines!
non-neutral	No!
neutral	Phoebe just because I'm alone doesnt mean I wanna walk around naked.
neutral	I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
non-neutral	Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
sadness	I know, I lied! I didnt want her to think I was a terrible mother! I cant even see my own baby!
neutral	Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  its-its-its, its right there .

non-neutral	I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...

neutral	Who's he sleeping with?
neutral	Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...
neutral	I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.
non-neutral	Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-!

anger	You know, this isn't fair.
anger	What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?
non-neutral	Huh?
anger	Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?
non-neutral	Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?

anger	Go!!
neutral	All right, all right, all right.
neutral	I mean Ill have to check with him first, but Ill think hell be cool with it.
non-neutral	So, hes just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesnt want anything in exchange for helping him?
neutral	Well, I assume Ill have to take showers with him, but y'know, thats true of any job.
neutral	How ya feelin?
neutral	Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it.

neutral	That's OK.
surprise	Oh, are you sure?
surprise	Really?
anger	Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
neutral	We can't do that.
surprise	What? What can't you do?
surprise	She really said that?
neutral	Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...

neutral	Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
non-neutral	I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
joy	Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.

neutral	Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?

anger	Yeah. No. No...
neutral	Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
neutral	Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
surprise	You're kidding.
neutral	No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
neutral	Oh there it is.
neutral	Thats not your regular dry cleaners.

non-neutral	I hope you dont think Im crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
neutral	A little.   Now youre talking.
neutral	Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
joy	I-I-Id love to. Let me just tell my friend.
joy	Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
neutral	She mustve left.
anger	Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!

non-neutral	Or not. Uh, Rach, why dont you just move in with me?
surprise	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
neutral	No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no Its okay, I mean Ilook Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursdays thing, but we dont have to do that!
neutral	Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless youre thinking about Naked Wednesdays.
joy	Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
joy	So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
neutral	Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
non-neutral	Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
disgust	Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
neutral	I was shrieking... like a Marine.
neutral	All right here. Watch me execute the three Ps of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.
neutral	She's not much of a phone person.
neutral	Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
non-neutral	Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
neutral	Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
non-neutral	Maybe you should.
non-neutral	Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
neutral	You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
neutral	Oh, that is so not true.
neutral	Oh, it is.
neutral	It isn't.
neutral	It is.
anger	Isn't!
neutral	Okay ladies, that ends todays class, and lets remember, lets be safe out there.
joy	Its a great class.
neutral	Thanks.
neutral	Yeah, yeah, I was watching.
neutral	Umm, hey, a couple of questions though.
non-neutral	Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
neutral	Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them
non-neutral	No. No-no. No. What would
surprise	Who? Me the attacker?
sadness	Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you.
sadness	Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
surprise	No-noReally?!
non-neutral	Of course!
sadness	Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh
sadness	Ohh, Im sorry.

non-neutral	What?! Anything! Anything!
neutral	Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.
non-neutral	This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
surprise	Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
neutral	Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later.
neutral	Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over here. All right, come on
non-neutral	Hey, you guys. Listen, Im sorry that I was hogging the game beforeOh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
neutral	Theyre all Chandler.
surprise	Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good!
neutral	I did.  But it came at a price.
fear	But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.
surprise	Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!
joy	Sure!
neutral	Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?
joy	With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!
joy	And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!
neutral	Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much.
joy	Well, I like that idea.
joy	Obviously!
neutral	I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow?
neutral	I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like
disgust	No.
non-neutral	Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely."
disgust	Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
surprise	So, thats it?
neutral	I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
neutral	Which is why
anger	What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
non-neutral	I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
non-neutral	Are you mocking me?
neutral	No, Im not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.
joy	Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
joy	Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
neutral	Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but
neutral	Cat.
joy	Yes! You are so smart!  I love you.
joy	I love you too.
non-neutral	I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
surprise	Why?
neutral	I don't know.
joy	This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
neutral	That's

neutral	Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has
neutral	But
disgust	No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
neutral	Okay. Okay, but you cant fire him today.
non-neutral	Why not?!
non-neutral	Because Im dumping him today.
surprise	What?! You said he was sweet!
neutral	He
neutral	Just dont pick up your phone.
disgust	Then he comes over!  "Im so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
surprise	What? So now Im not allowed to fire him?
non-neutral	You cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill himself.
neutral	Okay well then, Ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
disgust	Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill
neutral	Okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it!
non-neutral	Okay. But the question is whos gonna go first. Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
non-neutral	Really? Thats the thing Im worse at! Youll see.
neutral	This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
sadness	Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
sadness	Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone?
neutral	Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
neutral	Oh. Well, Ill right you everyday.  15 Yemen Road, Yemen.

joy	Well, I then guess Im going to Yemen! Im going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
joy	Hi!
neutral	Hey.
neutral	HeyOoh, hows Hilda? Is she working out?
neutral	Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
neutral	Was she happy you gave her the job?
neutral	Oh, my-my new assistant was very happy that I hired my new assistant.
neutral	Hello?
surprise	Oh hey!
neutral	Can you, can you hang on a second?
neutral	Its the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
neutral	can you excuse me for a minute?
non-neutral	Hey, funny you should call.
neutral	I was just looking over next weeks script.

surprise	Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
neutral	Its so secluded up here.
joy	I know. I like it up here.
non-neutral	I feel like were the only two people in the world.  Oops. Sorry.
non-neutral	Whats the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
fear	No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-Iwould youactually, would you go check on that?

neutral	A lesson in the importance of unagi.
neutral	Ohh,
neutral	Perhaps. Now Im curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to
neutral	All right, so we werent
neutral	Im sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but Ilook, I just want you guys to be safe.
neutral	What are you doing?
neutral	Im leaning. This is where I lean.
neutral	Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
fear	Brenda a bee!
surprise	What?
non-neutral	Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
disgust	I think I know whats going on here.
neutral	You do?
disgust	Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its wrong. Youre married.
neutral	I totally understand.  Can I
joy	All right, let's do it!
surprise	No, no, no. What was that?
neutral	I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
non-neutral	Well, people!
neutral	People, people, people.
neutral	Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey.
neutral	Show 'em how it's done.
neutral	Count it off.
neutral	So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
disgust	Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and hes so cheap, hed never fly to London in a million years.
neutral	Yeah, invite him?
neutral	Hey, did I do these neat enough?
neutral	Yeah, theyre fine.
non-neutral	Yeah?
surprise	If anyone asks, well just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
neutral	Sure. Why not?
surprise	Really?
neutral	Yeah?
non-neutral	I dont think Id be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
fear	Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldnt invite her?
non-neutral	Oh, no-no, yknow I absolutely adore Rachel its just that, well it might be a awkward for you.
neutral	But its absolutely your decision.
neutral	More tea?
neutral	Yeah sure.
neutral	Earl Grey?
non-neutral	Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
neutral	Hi.
joy	Hey!
neutral	Hey! So how was the doctor?
joy	Oh, everything went great.
neutral	Good.
neutral	Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
non-neutral	Oh.
neutral	I dont see the baby. Where is it?
non-neutral	Oh no, I know I couldnt see it either at first, but its right umm  Ross, I lost it again.
non-neutral	Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
neutral	Excuse me?
neutral	Could you help me with something?
neutral	The patient Im looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.
neutral	And umm, hes like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
neutral	I think I know who youre talking about.
joy	Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
neutral	Im sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff
neutral	Uh, shes with me.  Dr. Drake Remoray.
neutral	Dr. Drake who?
neutral	Remoray. Its Portuguese. We need that information; Im a doctor.
surprise	A doctor at this hospital?
anger	Damnit woman were losing precious time! Now do you want this mans blood on your head?
neutral	Hands.
neutral	Hands!
neutral	It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in.
neutral	Hes a patient of mine, Ive been treating him for years!
neutral	Hes in room 816.
joy	816, thank you!
neutral	Thank you.
neutral	And what is his name?

neutral	Okay, Ill see you in our room.
neutral	Yeah.
surprise	Oh my God.
neutral	I know.
neutral	Okay, I gotta go.
surprise	Whoa! What?! Why?!
sadness	Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
surprise	Here?! Now?!
neutral	Well, yeah.
fear	I cant-I cant stay here all night, and if I go in there shes-shes gonna wanna... do stuff.
surprise	What happened?
sadness	Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago.
joy	Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
anger	Stupid, useless Canadian money!
neutral	Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
surprise	Really?
neutral	Will you call him?
joy	Yes!
joy	I will!
joy	Absolutely!
neutral	(She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other.
neutral	She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in
joy	Oh my God! That is so good!
neutral	Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it.
neutral	Hey!
neutral	Hey!
neutral	What do you got there?
neutral	Oh its umm, its tofu cake. Do you want some?
neutral	What are you doing tonight?

surprise	Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
surprise	What?! Tonight?!
neutral	Thats what Monica said.
surprise	After she gave me that big speech?!
anger	She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?
anger	I think shes trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
neutral	Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
disgust	Who cares? I repel women.
surprise	No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Its yours!
non-neutral	Yeah well, Im-Im a slut.
neutral	Me too.
joy	Hi Jill!
joy	Hey!
neutral	Hi .
neutral	Rachel.
surprise	Rachel! Well, you-youre not at home, youre-youre-youre right here.
non-neutral	Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But its not!
neutral	Okay. So well Ill umm,  Ill have her home by midnight.
non-neutral	That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
sadness	I'm sorry, man.
neutral	Hey, y'know what you should do?
neutral	You should make something happen for yourself.
neutral	Y'know, like-like write a play.
joy	Write a movie!
neutral	Huh?
neutral	I mean, what about those
sadness	Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
joy	Wait a second, I could star in it!
neutral	Or that.
non-neutral	I can't write!
sadness	Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?
sadness	I can't do it.
neutral	I'll help you.
neutral	Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.
neutral	And plus, it'll give me something to do.
neutral	Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
neutral	Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope thats cool.
neutral	Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
neutral	Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.
neutral	Although, I should probably tell you, shes a porn star.
neutral	Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good.
neutral	All right.
non-neutral	As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
neutral	Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt have to apologize.
neutral	I would really love it if I could do both.
non-neutral	All right, II have to ask.
neutral	What?
fear	Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
surprise	What?!
anger	Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
disgust	A hundred and forty-five pounds.
non-neutral	Yes, yes it is. Its uh  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
non-neutral	Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me?
anger	Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didnt bring you here so you can ambush her.
neutral	Frannie was the one who found your
anger	That bitch!
surprise	Monica! What
anger	Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
neutral	Hi Frannie, congratulations.
anger	You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!
surprise	Why?!
non-neutral	WhatWhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding?
non-neutral	What could I have possibly done?!
anger	Stuart!
neutral	I believe you know my husband.
neutral	So its really a question of
non-neutral	Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
surprise	Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
neutral	Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
surprise	Yeah?
neutral	It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
neutral	What's up?
neutral	Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk.
neutral	Man to uh, me.
neutral	Sure. Okay.
surprise	Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
neutral	Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
neutral	You mean scared.
neutral	No, I mean happy.
joy	Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
sadness	Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in.
surprise	What do you mean, theyre not moving in? They-theyre still moving in right?
neutral	No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
surprise	What?! Over a stupid room!
joy	Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but Im also really psyched cause I dont have to move in here!
joy	Oh no, yeah no, that parts great!
neutral	Yes
surprise	Shut-out!!
surprise	Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
non-neutral	Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
anger	Yeah, get out!
anger	You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!
anger	Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?
anger	Come on, wussies!
neutral	All right, ok, I gotta go.
neutral	I'm going,  and I'm gone.
neutral	One more game?
joy	Oh yeah!
sadness	Im sorry.
sadness	Ohhh. Dont go.
non-neutral	No, I-I-I gotta go.
non-neutral	No. No! No! No!
non-neutral	Honey, honey, people are looking.
anger	I dont care!  I dont care!!
non-neutral	Yeah, um, Im, Im leaving now.
non-neutral	You cant leave! I have your shoe!
non-neutral	Good-bye Chandler Bing.
neutral	Rachel has those in burgendy.
disgust	Oh, ew!
neutral	What?
neutral	Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you.
neutral	Um, can you roll your tongue?
neutral	Because I can, and my Mom couldnt, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
neutral	What, wait, you mean like this?
surprise	Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
neutral	Your not doing it.
neutral	Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I cant. We dont have that....
neutral	Where there is no fear of commitment.
neutral	Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
neutral	Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.
neutral	But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.
fear	It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!
neutral	If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.
neutral	Right.
neutral	In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
non-neutral	Amazingly, that makes sense.
neutral	You think?
joy	Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
fear	Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
joy	Hey!  Hey!
joy	Hi!
joy	Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
joy	Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
neutral	Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
neutral	Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
surprise	Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!
non-neutral	Im missin picture time?!
anger	Yknow she has a face Ross!
non-neutral	Okay. Okay, heres a good one of us.
joy	Wow!
joy	That is a good one!
joy	Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card yknow, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
neutral	Yknow, every year I say Im gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it.
neutral	Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?
surprise	Together? Like-like to people?
joy	Yeah, yknow. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. Itll be cute, okay?
non-neutral	Okay.
neutral	Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?
neutral	Uh sure, sure.
neutral	Bye guys.
non-neutral	I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
non-neutral	You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve got a girlfriend?
neutral	Is this about Mark?
surprise	Oh my God.
neutral	Okay, its not, its not.
non-neutral	Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
neutral	Fine, youre right.
neutral	Lets ah, lets take a break,  lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
non-neutral	No. A break from us.
non-neutral	Bing! Were all set for tonight, 8 oclock.
non-neutral	Oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. Monica has to work.
non-neutral	Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
neutral	Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.
non-neutral	Oh? Why not?
neutral	Its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament.
non-neutral	Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
non-neutral	Well now-now youre just talking crazy.
neutral	So why cant the three of us go out together?
sadness	Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
non-neutral	Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.
joy	And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
anger	Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
neutral	Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this.
joy	Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club.
anger	Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.
neutral	Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.
neutral	It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.
anger	: Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!
neutral	It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
neutral	What are you doing?
neutral	Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy.
neutral	Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.
neutral	There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.
neutral	Did he call?
sadness	No. Sorry.
non-neutral	Why?! Why?! He said hed call. Why hasnt he called?
neutral	Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
non-neutral	Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasnt he called, Rachel? Why?
neutral	Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
surprise	Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
neutral	Well...
non-neutral	The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you?
neutral	No. I...
anger	Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
non-neutral	And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?
non-neutral	I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion!
anger	Is that too much to ask after six years?!
non-neutral	I mean what?
non-neutral	Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!
non-neutral	I mean do we not have as much fun?!
non-neutral	Dont I deserve a few tears?!!
non-neutral	I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
non-neutral	Hey!
anger	I did not cry my eyes out!!
non-neutral	Come on!
sadness	Its like the end of an era!
sadness	No more J-man and Channies!
non-neutral	!
non-neutral	Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
neutral	Do I know why were rushing?
neutral	Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
neutral	Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.
joy	Oh, I found it!

neutral	Do
neutral	Ah,
neutral	Do
neutral	Ah,
non-neutral	DO YOU?
non-neutral	Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was a beautiful speech.
disgust	Oh, come on.
non-neutral	Hey!
joy	All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!
neutral	And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.
neutral	And what you said about Nana.
non-neutral	Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there.
neutral	And you know what?
neutral	I think she was.
surprise	Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
neutral	You forget how many great songs Heart had.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
non-neutral	So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
neutral	Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but Im not even sure I got it.
neutral	What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey.
neutral	And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.
non-neutral	You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
neutral	Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
anger	I cant find garbage bags!
neutral	Oh, I think I saw some in here.
surprise	What is it?!
disgust	I dont know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itll die.
non-neutral	I cant believe were living here!
surprise	You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really  proposing?
non-neutral	No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.
surprise	Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it  look like?!
non-neutral	I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of  it.
non-neutral	Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
sadness	Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don't want to hurt her.
neutral	Okay, look, just do it gently.
neutral	You're right.
neutral	You're right.
neutral	I-I'll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I'll be gentle.
neutral	I can do that.
neutral	I am a gentle person.
neutral	Oh, by the  way.
neutral	Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.
neutral	Hi, Pheebs?
neutral	Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
non-neutral	What?!
non-neutral	Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England.
neutral	Which
neutral	How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
neutral	Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
neutral	Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
joy	Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which
joy	Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here
anger	You completely stole my answer!
non-neutral	Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
anger	Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
neutral	What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
neutral	I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
neutral	Would ya care to venture one?
neutral	Would

neutral	Okay then.
neutral	All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.
neutral	And-and when she comes in hopefully, she wont recognise you because, well, why would she?
neutral	Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.
neutral	You be Mr. Gonzalez, and Ill be uh, Mr. Wong.
neutral	Diverse.
neutral	Did anybody call for security?
neutral	You be cool.
neutral	Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk?  Hey, Joey?
fear	Wheres my ring? My dead grandmothers wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
neutral	Way to be cool, man.
neutral	Whats he talking about?
non-neutral	There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
surprise	Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
anger	We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
surprise	Okay, who are you?
non-neutral	The Hardy boys?
anger	Look, I dont need to steal some stupid ring, all right?
anger	I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
neutral	Marry me.
surprise	Oh my God! Joey!
joy	Hell yeah! Ill marry you!
anger	You cant marry him!
non-neutral	Hey lady, your days over! Its my turn!
surprise	Phoebe!
surprise	Why?! Why cant she marry me?!
non-neutral	I can and I will!
neutral	Shes not pregnant. Its Rachel. Rachels the one whos pregnant.
surprise	Oh my God.

non-neutral	People have got to finish their stories!
surprise	Oh my God, youre back!

neutral	Why do you want to see my hand?
disgust	I wanna see whats in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
neutral	Yeah.
disgust	Eww! Oh, its all dirty. You should throw this out.
anger	No!
non-neutral	Me too!
neutral	Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, yknow?

non-neutral	Look, I dont feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
neutral	Oh, okay.  Hey, two beers.
neutral	You wanna go in the bedroom? Its a little more comfortable.
neutral	Sure.
surprise	Okay.  Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?

anger	Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
surprise	Rach, Im sorry, but you didnt give me any contracts!
anger	Yes I did! And I put a little
neutral	Im telling you, you never gave them to me.
anger	Yknow what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
non-neutral	No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are

neutral	Oh right, Coach Ruben.
neutral	Do you know what Pheebs?
fear	When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
neutral	Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
neutral	See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
surprise	What do you mean?
anger	Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
anger	Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
surprise	Uh, what was that?

disgust	Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
neutral	Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight.
non-neutral	I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
sadness	Im sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby
neutral	So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?

joy	Oh, what a fun office.
neutral	I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.
neutral	So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
neutral	Rachel? Do you smoke?
neutral	Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror storiesabout ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
neutral	What?
neutral	Peach pit.
neutral	Yes, Bunny?
neutral	Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
neutral	-Peaches?

sadness	So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
neutral	It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
neutral	Do you want me to be afraid of you?
neutral	Of course not.
joy	I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.
non-neutral	I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
surprise	Really?
neutral	Of course!
non-neutral	Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
neutral	All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit
anger	Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is
disgust	A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
non-neutral	Ooh, it's not a toy.
sadness	Well, I don't know what else to do.
non-neutral	I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!
non-neutral	So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!
non-neutral	'Cause I-I got nothing!
non-neutral	All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.
neutral	Okay then.

neutral	Excuse me.
neutral	Yeah?
neutral	Are you Phoebe Buffay?
neutral	Yeah.
joy	Can-can I get your autograph, Im your biggest fan.
neutral	I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
joy	Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
non-neutral	No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
neutral	Come on, two on one.
surprise	What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
surprise	What, now?
joy	Yes, now is when you swoop!
joy	You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not!
non-neutral	You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
neutral	My Catholic friend is right.
neutral	She's distraught.
neutral	You're there for her.
joy	You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
neutral	Well, I just called Joshua
non-neutral	Oh, how did it go?
neutral	Well, I did my best to convince him that Im not some crazy girl who is dying to get marriedIm just going through a hard time.
neutral	What did he say?
non-neutral	Well uh, his answering machine was
non-neutral	Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that hes gonna call you again.
sadness	Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care.
sadness	I dont think hes the one Im sad about.
sadness	Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well.
sadness	Yeah, maybe.
sadness	And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
non-neutral	Any luck?
sadness	Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?
sadness	I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
non-neutral	Again. Yknow what? I think we all did.
non-neutral	Hey!
surprise	I dont get it!
non-neutral	It was in my room all night!
non-neutral	And if she didnt take it, and I didnt take it; and you  didnt take it, then who did?
anger	Shh!
anger	Were trying to think!
neutral	This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
surprise	What?!
joy	Oh yeah!
neutral	I got in there myself once.
neutral	My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldnt, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.
neutral	Yeah.
non-neutral	It was funny til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
neutral	No, you, you cant fit in that thing. Thats not deep enough.
non-neutral	Oh yeah?  If I cant, Ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
neutral	All right, you have yourself a deal.
surprise	Okay.  See?! I told ya!
non-neutral	Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
neutral	Hey! Whats up?
non-neutral	Hey!

non-neutral	Look at this, look.
non-neutral	She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.
non-neutral	She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.
non-neutral	She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
neutral	You're not an artist.
non-neutral	Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
surprise	I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
non-neutral	No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
neutral	I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
non-neutral	Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!

surprise	How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
joy	Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
non-neutral	Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.

surprise	What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
sadness	Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
neutral	Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
sadness	Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right?
neutral	Yeah, I guess so.
sadness	I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
surprise	Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?!
joy	I just found out this is Chandlers office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!
non-neutral	Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
anger	We said seven!
anger	We said six!
neutral	The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.
anger	Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!"
joy	Hi!
disgust	Oh my good God.
disgust	Ugh!
non-neutral	I know what time you said.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.

non-neutral	Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-IHey! I did
anger	Thats my wife!!! Get out!
neutral	Well, we should go.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport.
neutral	Oh please.
non-neutral	Every moment is precious.
neutral	Yknow?
non-neutral	Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.
neutral	Well, were really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
non-neutral	On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane.
non-neutral	No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.
neutral	Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
neutral	Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
neutral	So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.
neutral	We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
joy	Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.
surprise	Yeah?
joy	Yeah!
neutral	Just go for it Chandler.
neutral	Yeah, you should.
neutral	Yeah, you should, really.
neutral	Go on.
neutral	All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. But Im just doing it for you guys.
non-neutral	: Im sure as hell a dancer, its no use Marge will never go for me.
non-neutral	Come on Treeger, dont say that.
neutral	You just ahh, you just need more practice.
neutral	Here, come on, lets ahh, lets try it again.
neutral	Come on.
non-neutral	Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.
non-neutral	I mean, yknow, Im not really that comfortable dancing with a We-he!!
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	: Yeah!
neutral	Oh, I
neutral	Are you sure? Ill bet theres another flight to Minsk in like
neutral	July. Umm,
non-neutral	Thats really beautiful. What does it mean?
neutral	Please, clean my beakers. I dont get out of the lab much.
non-neutral	Thats good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
neutral	Yeah, I Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldnt because yknow, Ihave to leave.
non-neutral	Youre right! Youre right. Dont say it.
non-neutral	I-I do though.
non-neutral	I do too.
neutral	Bye Phoebe.
non-neutral	Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
neutral	I know.
surprise	Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that?
non-neutral	Listen, Im gettin something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
neutral	No, I do not hear that.
joy	Yeah, I-I heard.  I think its great!  Ohh, Im so happy for you!
joy	Oh, well, thats great!
joy	Yeah! Yeah!
joy	I cant believe youre getting married!
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Monica and Rachel made out.
surprise	Ohhh!
surprise	Why are we in bed together?
neutral	I dont know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
neutral	Yeah.
surprise	Really?!
neutral	No!
fear	But we-we didnt havesex-uh, did we?
neutral	I mean, I dont remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
joy	Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
neutral	And we didnt have sex.
neutral	Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. Im just glad we didnt do anything stupid.
neutral	Tell me about it.
neutral	What are we gonna do?
neutral	I say we go with
neutral	Chandler?
neutral	Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
non-neutral	Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
disgust	Whats that smell?
non-neutral	I know!
neutral	Hi, remember us?
neutral	Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a
neutral	I am. I'm
neutral	Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
sadness	Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
neutral	Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
neutral	Yknow what? It
neutral	Sorry.
joy	Im so exited!
joy	Ive been waiting for this for months!
joy	I got my hair coloured!
joy	I got new sheets!
joy	Im making him a
neutral	Um-hmm.
neutral	What am I making him by the way?
neutral	Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
surprise	I thought I was making him filet mignon?
neutral	Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.
non-neutral	And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
surprise	Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
non-neutral	Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!
non-neutral	Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated.
neutral	Yknow its like uh, Biology!
non-neutral	Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
neutral	Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.
non-neutral	Phoebe!
neutral	If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes probably not gay.
neutral	You are falling fast asleep.
neutral	Deeper.
neutral	Deeper.
neutral	Deeper.
neutral	You are now completely asleep.
neutral	You dont need to smoke.
neutral	Cigarettes dont control you.
neutral	You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
neutral	A strong, confident woman.
neutral	Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller.
joy	Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
neutral	Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
non-neutral	Of course not.
neutral	No.
neutral	Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
neutral	So how are things going with Paul?
joy	Good.
non-neutral	Although yknow, he-hes a private guy.
sadness	Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
neutral	Thats easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wont open.
surprise	So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
neutral	No thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
neutral	Hi honey.
joy	Hi!
fear	Okay, Ben, I wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident.
surprise	Monica, number one, I dont think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!
neutral	You said number two.
neutral	I also said number one.
neutral	Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
neutral	Cant I just look at the handles on them?
neutral	You would think.
neutral	Okay, fine.
non-neutral	Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why Im a terrible waitress?
neutral	Because, I dont care.
neutral	I dont care.
non-neutral	I dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I dont care where the tray spot is, I just dont care, this is not what I want to do.
non-neutral	So I dont think I should do it anymore.
non-neutral	Im gonna give you my weeks notice.
surprise	What?!
non-neutral	Gunther, I quit.
surprise	Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee?
non-neutral	Ohh, I mean its just so realistic!
neutral	I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.
joy	Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
neutral	Do you uh, do youready for a refill?
surprise	Oh, I probably shouldntso I will!  Oh! Wow! Its like its raining!
joy	Pretty cool, huh?
neutral	But if youre thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldnt get sucked up into the mechanism, well youd be wrong.
neutral	Umm, can I use your bathroom?
neutral	Its uh, right through there.
non-neutral	Okay.  God yknow, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbianis apartment
joy	Yeah, lifes pretty great isnt it?
joy	Yeah, it sure is!
neutral	You know, I think I was sixteen.
neutral	Please, just a little bit off the back.
neutral	I'm still on "no."
neutral	Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
anger	No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.
neutral	What's goin' on?
neutral	Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
non-neutral	What stupid thing did you do?
disgust	Ewww!
neutral	I know.
neutral	See, yes.
neutral	Thats Yasmine Bleeth, shes a completely different kind of chick.
neutral	I love you both.
neutral	But in very different ways.
surprise	Hey!
surprise	Hey!
neutral	(sees hes watching
non-neutral	I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
non-neutral	If they cant find a home for her, they kill her! And Im not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
non-neutral	Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
disgust	Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of other animals!
disgust	Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
joy	Thanks, Im glad you see it that way.
joy	Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
neutral	So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
non-neutral	Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
neutral	So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
neutral	Ohh, he's really shy. I-I dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
neutral	Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
non-neutral	I dont care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
surprise	Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?
neutral	I might've said that.  Why is that funny?
joy	Because I'm very happy for him!  And
non-neutral	Hi!
neutral	All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	All right, let's go say good-bye.
neutral	Hey!
anger	Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?
disgust	Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
surprise	Fish!
neutral	It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
sadness	Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here
joy	Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
joy	We did have fun, didn't we?
joy	We did!
neutral	Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
joy	Oh, I would love to!
joy	Yay, okay!
joy	Good, good, good, good, good.
neutral	Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
neutral	Um...  Done!
surprise	Youre, hey, youre not paying for the pizza!
neutral	Oh come on, its only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
neutral	Ahh, Id throw another thousand on that.
neutral	Why, how much is that?
neutral	Thats about 60 cents.
neutral	Okay, its coffee.
surprise	Ice coffee? Tell me its ice coffee!
neutral	Its-its hot
surprise	Hot coffee!!!
anger	You idiot!!
anger	You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!
anger	What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?!
non-neutral	Huh?
anger	!
neutral	Whats your favourite thing about summertime?
neutral	Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
neutral	Yeah
surprise	Hey!
joy	Tommyyyy! Say, whats your favourite thing about summer?
neutral	Ooh, I dont know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
non-neutral	Ohh, thats a good one.
neutral	OK, try this salmon mousse.
joy	Mmmm. Good.
neutral	Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
non-neutral	It's creamier.
neutral	Yeah, well, is that
disgust	I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
surprise	My God! What happened to you?
disgust	Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?
non-neutral	"You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
joy	That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
non-neutral	Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really
non-neutral	Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
joy	Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
neutral	Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
neutral	I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
non-neutral	Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
neutral	Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
neutral	I don't see why not.
neutral	Here's my retainer!
neutral	Someone in there?
non-neutral	No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.
surprise	Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
neutral	Someone was in the lady's room, I couldnt wait. I left the lid up for ya though.

neutral	Nope, nope, Id just ah, Id rather talk to you.
neutral	Yes, I do.
neutral	Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
neutral	Someone in here.
anger	Im going to keep dating him Mother, and theres nothing you can do about it!
anger	Oh yes there is!
anger	What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
anger	That was an accident! And so were you.
anger	Well, at least Im not a murderer!
non-neutral	Oh, my baby!
surprise	That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
neutral	Oh, just years of experience.
non-neutral	Can I get some ice here?!
joy	Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
non-neutral	Youre not the fan whos dying are you?
surprise	Say what?
neutral	Im supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying, but thats not supposed to be until  later!
non-neutral	No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-Im the guy in the coma!
surprise	Oh that was a real person?!
non-neutral	An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
surprise	I-I-Im leaving the show?
neutral	I dont know. Why? Did you hear something?
surprise	Who told you that?
non-neutral	Oh uh, one of the writers.
surprise	Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
neutral	Umm
neutral	Feel better?
joy	Yeah!
joy	Much!
non-neutral	Listen uh, not that Im yknow insecure about my manhood or anything yknow, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
neutral	Yeah, I understand.
joy	Yeah! Okay!  Hey! Hi!
joy	Hi!
surprise	Yknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
neutral	I dont think so.
non-neutral	Oh! Maybe its because Im on television. Im an actor on
surprise	Wow!
neutral	Yeah.
surprise	Really?!

neutral	$4.50 please.
neutral	Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.

non-neutral	Oh God, do something.
non-neutral	Just make contact, smile!
joy	There you go!
non-neutral	You're definitely scaring here.
neutral	Would you like to call somebody?
neutral	Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.

neutral	Oh

neutral	In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a
neutral	Phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, she doesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know that youve been living with your Grandmothers for a week now.
neutral	Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey.
sadness	Im never gonna find a roommate, ever.
neutral	Why, nobody good?
disgust	Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural.
disgust	The spitter.
non-neutral	Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.
neutral	Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing
neutral	So how many more do you have tomorrow?
neutral	Two.
neutral	This photographer, who seemed really dull.
neutral	And this actor guy, who Im not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone Chandler Bing, he said Whoa-whoa, short message.

non-neutral	What-what are-what are these?
joy	Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought theyd brighten up the place. They do dont you think?
non-neutral	No-no-no, no!
neutral	Well, how-how come?
neutral	Thats just the way it is.
surprise	Thats crazy.
neutral	Maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.
neutral	See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now Peter!
neutral	Hey, Peter!

neutral	Op.
non-neutral	Eh.
neutral	Oh, you got me.
neutral	Well, dont think I havent noticed your potential.
neutral	Well, Ive got a project for you thats a lot more related to fashion.
neutral	How does that sound?
joy	Oh, that sounds great.
neutral	Come on over here, sweetheart.
joy	Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
fear	Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe youd want to get back together?
neutral	No. But thanks.
sadness	Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
neutral	Okay. No. But thanks.
neutral	Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
surprise	Wow, that was kinda brutal.
neutral	Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.
neutral	Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, yknow.
neutral	Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,
neutral	Yeah, sure.
surprise	Wow.
neutral	I'm, I'm really sorry.
neutral	Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
surprise	Relieved?
neutral	Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
neutral	She wants
anger	Oh my God! If you say that one more time,
anger	Fine!
anger	Fine!
anger	But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  If you accept full responsibility...  Full responsibility!
anger	...I can begin to trust you again.
anger	Does that seem like something you can do.
anger	Does it?!
anger	!
surprise	No?
neutral	Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel.
neutral	If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
sadness	Yeah, I know.
sadness	I mean, no, youre right.
neutral	Yeah I guess Ill let it go.
sadness	But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
neutral	Sure, its hard to forget!
neutral	But that doesnt mean you have to talk about it!
neutral	A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.
surprise	What the hell happened on that beach?!
neutral	Its between us and the sea, Ross!
non-neutral	I didnt think you were gay. I do now.
neutral	See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
sadness	Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious.
neutral	Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
surprise	Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
neutral	Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
joy	Oh wow! Im free for her!

neutral	Hey, Chandler, why dont we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
neutral	Hold on, yknow I
non-neutral	Oh well, thats uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
neutral	Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
neutral	Well, I dont really know what that is, but
neutral	Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
neutral	Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
disgust	Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
surprise	What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.

non-neutral	Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.

non-neutral	Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
non-neutral	So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
non-neutral	Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
neutral	Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
surprise	You know it?
neutral	Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
neutral	Oh, sure, they love us over there.
joy	Ben! Ben! Ben!
anger	Gimme em!
anger	No! They are mine!
anger	You stole them from me!
anger	You stole them from me!!
anger	Gimme them!
neutral	You just wanna each take one?
neutral	Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
non-neutral	Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
neutral	Well
neutral	Why dont you phase it out?
non-neutral	Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think youre, yknow, that youre adjusting to life in America.
neutral	Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean theyre probably not even listening!
surprise	Theyre not listening too me?
neutral	Of course theyre listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
non-neutral	Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
neutral	I think you look fine.
neutral	How about Joey... Pepponi?
neutral	No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
neutral	Joey... Switzerland?
neutral	Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.
non-neutral	Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.
neutral	Which I'm not.
non-neutral	Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
neutral	Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
neutral	Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
non-neutral	Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
neutral	Might wanna try Joseph.
non-neutral	Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
joy	Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
surprise	Are you kidding?
neutral	Okay, look.
non-neutral	I-I studied evolution.
non-neutral	Remember, evolution?
non-neutral	Monkey into man?
neutral	Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey.
non-neutral	Im Doctor Monkey!
neutral	Im not arguing with that.
non-neutral	All right, Ive heard enough. Ive made my decision.
disgust	You are both idiots.
disgust	The joke is not funny, and its offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys!
anger	You shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!
anger	Now let it go!
anger	The joke sucks!
neutral	Its your joke.
anger	Is not.
non-neutral	Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
joy	I didnt!
neutral	Even when I found outumm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
non-neutral	Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
surprise	Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
neutral	Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and
non-neutral	Did you, did you
neutral	No.
non-neutral	Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
joy	Yes!
anger	Then don't touch one!!
surprise	Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
joy	Yeah!
joy	Thanks!
neutral	All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
joy	Done!
non-neutral	And it can't be Joey.
neutral	It's not.
neutral	Or Joseph.
non-neutral	Oh.
neutral	Hi!
joy	Hi! Hey, Pete youre back! Hey, check this out.
joy	Wow! Skates!
surprise	Wow! Youre a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was youre trip?
neutral	Well...
non-neutral	Oh, whatd ya bring me?!
non-neutral	Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan.
joy	Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection.
neutral	You want some coffee?
neutral	Yeah, sure, thatd be great.
neutral	Regular or decaf?
neutral	Ah, which ever is closest.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	So ask me what I did today.
neutral	So what did you do today Pete?
joy	I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
surprise	What?! Oh.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Where've you been?
neutral	At the vet.
fear	She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
non-neutral	She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
joy	Hey! He beat ya.
sadness	She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
neutral	So what does this mean?
sadness	I'm gonna have to give him up.
anger	Aww man! I cant believe I locked myself out again!
non-neutral	Hang on buddy!
surprise	Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
neutral	I sure did.
surprise	But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
non-neutral	Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
neutral	May I come in?
neutral	Uh, yeah, if you want too.
neutral	Do
neutral	Yeah, sure?
neutral	So do I.
neutral	Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.
neutral	This is just about tonight.
neutral	I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us."
neutral	Okay?
non-neutral	I just want this to be  about what it is!
non-neutral	And um, what-what is that Ross?
joy	The physical act of love.
surprise	What?! Are you crazy?
surprise	Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
surprise	Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
non-neutral	You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
non-neutral	Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
non-neutral	No! No!  No!  No-no-no-no.
surprise	Ohh wow! Im sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
neutral	Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
fear	It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's gonna kill me.
neutral	Yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there.
neutral	Ah Joey.
neutral	Joey Tribbiani.
neutral	Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
non-neutral	So, does that mean the audition is off?
neutral	Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Aw come on Joey, it's easy.
neutral	Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
non-neutral	It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
neutral	Have fun.
neutral	Bye.
surprise	Wow! Fortunately she has a
surprise	Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
surprise	Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!
surprise	!
neutral	Hi there.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
neutral	Ok.
neutral	Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!
neutral	So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
anger	Oh, DAMN IT!
neutral	Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
neutral	Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.
neutral	Ok.
neutral	Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
non-neutral	Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
non-neutral	We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
joy	Yeah! C'mon!
neutral	Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
neutral	Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
neutral	No, she's at a faculty meeting.
neutral	Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...
neutral	Come in.
neutral	Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
neutral	What's it look like?
neutral	Kinda like a big face without skin.
neutral	Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
surprise	Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
neutral	Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
joy	Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
neutral	Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
surprise	The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
non-neutral	What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
surprise	You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
neutral	I have no idea what you just said.
neutral	Put Joey on the phone.
non-neutral	What's up man?
fear	I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth
non-neutral	Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Chandler, listen.
neutral	Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
neutral	and that was all before 10 oclock.
neutral	The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.
neutral	And then the florist phoned to say there arent any tulips.
neutral	Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.
neutral	Were not gonna be
surprise	Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?
anger	Well, up yours too!
neutral	Wheres Chandler?
surprise	Ah, he cant make it, he said he had to his...  Whoa-oh!
neutral	Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
neutral	Joey I can see you okay? Youre hiding behind the coats.
neutral	Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
non-neutral	Well, if you dont have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
non-neutral	Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
joy	Yeah! You wanna come?
joy	Yeah!
neutral	Fine.
neutral	Fine.
neutral	Fine.
neutral	Fine.
neutral	All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
neutral	Hey.
non-neutral	Whats the matter?
disgust	Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
surprise	Oh Willies still alive!
neutral	What are you guys doing?
non-neutral	Oh, my mom called, theyre gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so were looking for a good picture of us.
neutral	Oooh, Im afraid that does not exist.
surprise	Thats not true, there are great pictures of us!
neutral	No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whos going like this
surprise	Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the
sadness	I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture.
joy	Oh, heres a great one.
neutral	Yeah, Im not in that.
joy	I know, but look at me: all tan.
neutral	Hey, why dont you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.
joy	Thats a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Yknow
neutral	Yeah thats great! Next to that, Chandler wont look so stupid.
neutral	Chandler what do you say?
neutral	All right, but I should warn you, Im not going. Im going.
__label__surprise Why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
__label__non-neutral Oh. Thats so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, Wheres number 27?!
__label__neutral Y'know what?
__label__neutral It didnt.
__label__joy Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what Ive got with Alice.
__label__surprise Now, wh-what, what is that like?
__label__joy Its so cool man, its so, its just cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah.
__label__non-neutral Why cant I find that?
__label__anger Dont ask me, I had it and I blew it!
__label__non-neutral Well, I want it!
__label__non-neutral You can have it!
__label__non-neutral I dont know, maybe I cant. I mean, maybe theres something wrong with me.
__label__non-neutral Oh, no! No!
__label__joy Its out there man! Ive seen it! I got it!!
__label__non-neutral Then you hold on to it!!
__label__joy All right, man!!
__label__joy All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
__label__neutral Come on, Lydia, you can do it.
__label__joy Push!
__label__joy Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder.
__label__joy Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out!
__label__joy Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho.
__label__joy Let's  I was justyeah, right.
__label__joy Push!
__label__joy Push!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
__label__non-neutral Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
__label__surprise Okay, go left. Left! Left!
__label__anger Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
__label__non-neutral Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!
__label__non-neutral Straight up over your head!
__label__joy You can do it!
__label__joy You can do it!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral You got it?
__label__neutral Oh, okay, I get it.
__label__fear No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even
__label__neutral Howard's the
__label__neutral Yes but too me he's just, man.
__label__non-neutral Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
__label__disgust Ugh, can you believe that guy!
__label__neutral Yeah. I really like his glasses.
__label__surprise Ohh!
__label__neutral What?
__label__surprise It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__neutral Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
__label__fear Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
__label__disgust Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!
__label__non-neutral Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I dont have time!
__label__neutral Theyre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
__label__non-neutral Youre coming on to the entire room!  Im Chandler.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral You mind if I
__label__neutral No, please.
__label__neutral So uh, what are you in for?
__label__neutral I talk in my sleep.
__label__neutral What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
__label__neutral So why dont you give me your number?
__label__neutral Previously on Friends.
__label__neutral I dont know exactly. Its-its sorta like wrestling.
__label__surprise Oh?!
__label__neutral Yeah, but without the costumes.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral And its not fake, its totally brutal.
__label__neutral Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Theyre
__label__surprise So you can like, bite, and pull peoples hair and stuff?
__label__neutral Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
__label__surprise Whats fish hooking?
__label__neutral Huh, whats fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
__label__non-neutral What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
__label__non-neutral Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
__label__joy Well, that makes me feel so good.
__label__neutral It was just so awkward and bumpy.
__label__surprise Bumpy?
__label__neutral Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.
__label__neutral And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
__label__non-neutral Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
__label__non-neutral Coming through!  Oh! Coming through!  Oh! Hello! Hi!  No! Right! Coming through!
__label__neutral Oh well, its not so bad.
__label__sadness Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__surprise My God!
__label__neutral Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
__label__surprise Excuse me?
__label__non-neutral Joey! Hes working!  You would look
__label__non-neutral Oh, how bad is it?
__label__sadness Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that isnt burned is an ass. Which I do
__label__neutral Hows your room Rach?
__label__sadness Everythings ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
__label__neutral Isnt that mine?
__label__non-neutral Fine! Im sorry for your loss!
__label__neutral So uh, youre not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
__label__non-neutral Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am
__label__neutral Yes, they can stay with us.
__label__neutral Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
__label__non-neutral Theres just so much pressure.
__label__neutral I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.
__label__neutral I dont know if youd understand.
__label__neutral Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
__label__non-neutral Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!
__label__neutral Well, yknow.
__label__fear I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time.
__label__neutral So Im gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on.
__label__neutral Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__non-neutral Whats all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
__label__neutral Ross, we can handle this.
__label__sadness Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.
__label__anger I mean, enough of the silliness!
__label__anger Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!
__label__non-neutral Okay-okay!
__label__non-neutral Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together.
__label__non-neutral Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?
__label__non-neutral That is so silly.
__label__neutral Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
__label__neutral Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
__label__joy Love is the best medicine.
__label__non-neutral Thats laughter.
__label__neutral Why do you do it?
__label__neutral I dont know.
__label__neutral Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
__label__neutral Yeah, I do.
__label__neutral And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, dont ya?
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__joy Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
__label__neutral Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
__label__surprise You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
__label__neutral Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.
__label__non-neutral Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!
__label__non-neutral Define me!
__label__non-neutral Love me, I need love!
__label__neutral '.
__label__surprise Have you really done this before?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral You just take a big, big swing.
__label__neutral Now, dont hold back.
__label__neutral and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey-hey-hey!
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__joy Were just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
__label__neutral Oh, all right.
__label__joy Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
__label__joy Okay!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Bye!
__label__neutral Bye!
__label__non-neutral Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
__label__neutral Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey.
__label__neutral Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
__label__neutral Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
__label__surprise Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one!
__label__neutral Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials?
__label__non-neutral Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down?
__label__neutral Because we can remember them.
__label__non-neutral Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
__label__neutral Hey. When you guys were kids and you played
__label__neutral I was always Joanne.
__label__neutral Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! the war cry of your neighbourhood?
__label__disgust Ewww! Oh! Its the Mattress King!
__label__non-neutral Booo!!
__label__disgust Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
__label__joy Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
__label__anger What a wank!
__label__anger Oh, I cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses.
__label__non-neutral I know!
__label__non-neutral And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.
__label__non-neutral And Im appalled for you by the way.
__label__non-neutral You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it alone.
__label__disgust Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my food.
__label__anger Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
__label__disgust Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
__label__neutral Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
__label__fear Im, Im freaking out!
__label__fear Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have!
__label__neutral All right, I havent lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.
__label__neutral Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
__label__neutral Um. yeah.
__label__neutral I am
__label__neutral All right, look, heres the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.
__label__neutral So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
__label__non-neutral Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work.
__label__neutral Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but thats why you have got to be the bigger man here.
__label__non-neutral Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me!
__label__non-neutral Like me tiny doctor!
__label__non-neutral Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
__label__non-neutral Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along.
__label__anger Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.
__label__non-neutral Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna have to have a separate room for you too!
__label__anger !
__label__neutral Okay, okay, okay.  Ill get the bagels.
__label__neutral Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
__label__neutral All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
__label__neutral Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
__label__surprise Really? A purse?
__label__non-neutral It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
__label__neutral It looks like a women's purse.
__label__neutral No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,
__label__neutral See look,
__label__neutral Exactly! Unisex!
__label__neutral Maybe you need sex.
__label__non-neutral No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
__label__neutral Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
__label__neutral So, um, have you told your parents?
__label__neutral No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__neutral You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.
__label__neutral .
__label__neutral .
__label__non-neutral no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.
__label__joy I love you Phoebe.
__label__surprise So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral I just came over to drop offnothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, it did.
__label__sadness So, I guess this is over.
__label__neutral What?
__label__sadness Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
__label__non-neutral Why, exactly?
__label__sadness Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
__label__surprise Chandler that's crazy!
__label__anger If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!
__label__neutral So, this isn't over?
__label__joy You are so cute!
__label__non-neutral No.
__label__neutral No, it was a fight.
__label__non-neutral You deal with it and move on!
__label__neutral It's nothing to freak out about.
__label__joy Really? Okay. Great!
__label__joy Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
__label__surprise We're in a relationship?
__label__neutral I'm afraid so.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral So you like the short hair better.
__label__neutral What? YetiI mean Danny?
__label__neutral Can I tell you a little secret?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral I want to keep one.
__label__joy Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
__label__neutral Oh, please.
__label__neutral What? Honey.
__label__neutral Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
__label__sadness Oh God, Im so sorry.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__non-neutral Ow!!
__label__surprise Oh God!
__label__non-neutral Hey, you guys! Guess what?
__label__neutral Got a job on a river boat?
__label__non-neutral Y'know what I didnt wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? Youre not my girlfriend anymore so...
__label__neutral Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
__label__neutral Right.
__label__non-neutral Now that youre on youre own, youre free to look as stupid as you like.
__label__neutral You like it right?
__label__neutral Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! Im kidding!
__label__neutral Yeah, come here!
__label__neutral What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
__label__neutral Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
__label__anger Okay, good bye!
__label__joy Hey I got one! I got one!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Oh uh, up or down?
__label__non-neutral Oh down please.  I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?
__label__neutral Could you press up too please?
__label__sadness Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
__label__neutral Oh yeah? Howd yours happen?
__label__neutral Well, its a long story.
__label__neutral Its kind of embarrassing.
__label__non-neutral Lets just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
__label__neutral How about you?
__label__sadness Car accident.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__non-neutral Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasnt paying attention?
__label__neutral Yeah. Me.  Oh hey, thats me.  Hey uh, I take it youre just visiting someone.
__label__neutral Uh-huh, yeah.
__label__neutral Well umm, if you have sometime yknow and maybe you might want to visit someone else
__label__joy Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
__label__neutral Im in the middle
__label__anger Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
__label__neutral Uh, you gotta press the button.
__label__neutral Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
__label__surprise Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
__label__neutral Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car.    We're way ahead of the game.
__label__surprise Oh my god.
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise There's something new in the bowl.

__label__neutral Long story, honey.
__label__neutral All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?
__label__neutral C'mon up.
__label__non-neutral Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
__label__anger So, I hear, you hate me!
__label__neutral I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
__label__non-neutral A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
__label__non-neutral And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
__label__anger All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.
__label__neutral So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.
__label__non-neutral But what does that gonna do...
__label__non-neutral For Chandler!
__label__joy Guess what, I got an audition!
__label__joy Awww, one of my students got an audition. Im so proud.

__label__neutral You cant ask us son, thats cheating.
__label__neutral Youre right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
__label__neutral Well, he better not come by here. He cant see the bride in the wedding dress.
__label__non-neutral As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
__label__neutral But that was after the wedding, its not bad luck then.
__label__neutral Honey, it isnt good luck.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Monica!
__label__neutral I know! Hey, hows Chandler doin?
__label__neutral Great. Hes doing great. Dont you worry about Chandler.
__label__neutral Are you okay?
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__joy Yeah baby!
__label__neutral Im really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.
__label__neutral So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!

__label__neutral Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
__label__neutral Oh yeah, whos playing?
__label__neutral The players.
__label__neutral Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
__label__neutral Please, its a relief is what it is, is what it is.
__label__neutral All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__neutral Anything?
__label__non-neutral No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasnt heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandlers parents again!
__label__non-neutral You told them he was missing?
__label__neutral No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think Im interested in them.

__label__neutral I dont want to say.
__label__non-neutral Oh, come on! I dont care! Come on! Whose is it?
__label__neutral Diane Keaton.

__label__surprise Really?!
__label__joy Oh thats so exciting!
__label__joy Thank you!
__label__joy Thanks Mon!

__label__neutral "Cant, its not there."
__label__neutral Look, Im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
__label__sadness Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
__label__neutral Not once did we do that.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
__label__neutral Oh yeah? Well, howd she take it?
__label__neutral Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didnt cry. She wasnt angry or sad.
__label__neutral Uh-huh.
__label__neutral Im not going to do that.
__label__neutral Okay, if you need the vacuum, its in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator
__label__neutral Okay, okay, but Rachels gonna be here too, cant I just ask her this stuff?

__label__neutral But it's dark out.
__label__neutral Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
__label__neutral I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
__label__neutral I'm
__label__neutral I know, me too.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__non-neutral Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?
__label__joy Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
__label__non-neutral All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
__label__neutral Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
__label__joy Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
__label__neutral Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
__label__neutral Wait! What about Joey?
__label__neutral Oh umm, theres also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?

__label__non-neutral Im so sorry!
__label__non-neutral Sorry!
__label__neutral You didnt bring
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
__label__neutral Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
__label__disgust To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, youre
__label__neutral No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
__label__surprise Oh, youre switching apartments?
__label__neutral Its not for me, its for Rachel.
__label__neutral But Rachel has an apartment.
__label__neutral Yeah, but when the baby comes shes gonna want to move.
__label__surprise She is?
__label__surprise Yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you?
__label__neutral I guess I didnt really think about it.
__label__non-neutral Ezel!  Hey Gunther! Youre an ezel!
__label__anger Damnit!
__label__surprise Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people?
__label__neutral Little village people.
__label__joy Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
__label__joy Oh, that is so sweet!
__label__joy I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
__label__neutral Huh. Except, Phoebes not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
__label__sadness Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies.
__label__sadness Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
__label__surprise Wait a minute!
__label__joy Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after shes done being pregnant.
__label__neutral Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
__label__joy Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants shes always wanted!
__label__joy Oh, shes gonna love that!
__label__neutral Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
__label__neutral Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
__label__neutral So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
__label__anger Fine, Im mentally unstable.
__label__neutral And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Uh yes, heroin and crack.
__label__anger Crack isnt even an intravenous drug!
__label__neutral Well, you would know.
__label__neutral Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
__label__non-neutral Oh, come on!
__label__non-neutral Ross, please, I found the magazines!
__label__non-neutral No!
__label__neutral Phoebe just because I'm alone doesnt mean I wanna walk around naked.
__label__neutral I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
__label__non-neutral Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
__label__sadness I know, I lied! I didnt want her to think I was a terrible mother! I cant even see my own baby!
__label__neutral Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  its-its-its, its right there .
__label__joy Oh. Oh, its beautiful. I see it now.
__label__neutral Do you really?
__label__anger No, I dont see it!
__label__joy Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this?  This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy Sweetie thats it.
__label__joy Thats it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
__label__neutral Youre welcome.
__label__surprise Wow! I cant believe thats our baby.
__label__joy Yeah, thats our baby.
__label__neutral Gin.
__label__joy We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
__label__non-neutral Will you stop!
__label__neutral Okay. All right.
__label__joy Okay, all right, I think youre great, I think youre sweet, and youre smart, and I love you.
__label__disgust But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
__label__joy Hey, check me out, Im a slut!
__label__neutral So you uh, want to do something tonight?
__label__neutral Oh I cant. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__surprise Oh right!
__label__surprise Right!
__label__sadness Because youre still seeing him and uh, hes a good guy.
__label__sadness I mean, I remember a time when
__label__neutral Are you okay?
__label__joy Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
__label__joy Great! Its so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was
__label__neutral I bet he can.
__label__neutral Yknow, I dont have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure youre okay?
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah! Yeah! Dont worry about me, Ill be fine!
__label__neutral You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
__label__neutral Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
__label__non-neutral Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby?
__label__neutral Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
__label__non-neutral oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks.
__label__surprise I can't believe    I didn't even think of that.
__label__non-neutral I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...
__label__non-neutral What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?
__label__non-neutral It was a "Wendy's!!    "
__label__surprise ...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
__label__disgust Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else?
__label__surprise Like you, I dont even know where you work?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__anger So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
__label__neutral Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think Ill show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
__label__non-neutral Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
__label__non-neutral Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
__label__non-neutral Yeah!
__label__neutral Well, Im not going to go now anyway .
__label__neutral Okay .
__label__neutral Here you go.
__label__neutral Ah, Gunther, I cant pay for this right now because Im not working, so Ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin for stuff.
__label__neutral Well, if you want, you can work here.
__label__neutral Uh, I dont know.
__label__neutral Ya see, its just, see I was a regular on a soap opera yknow?
__label__sadness And to go from that to this, I just Plus, Id have to wait on all my friends.
__label__neutral Okay, but the moneys good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Flexible hours.
__label__neutral Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
__label__neutral I have no name.
__label__neutral All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
__label__neutral Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
__label__disgust No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
__label__surprise Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
__label__neutral Umm, Gene.

__label__neutral Oh, Larry.
__label__neutral Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
__label__neutral No, bribes.
__label__non-neutral It's okay to laugh right?
__label__non-neutral Come on Joey!!!
__label__non-neutral Rach, I told you everything I knew last night!
__label__neutral Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
__label__non-neutral I can't believe you would say that!
__label__neutral Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
__label__non-neutral No! I mean come on! This is a

__label__neutral I don't know.
__label__non-neutral Are they in love?
__label__neutral I don't know.
__label__anger You don't know anything.
__label__non-neutral Ohh, I know one thing!
__label__non-neutral What?
__label__non-neutral They did it right there on the couch.
__label__non-neutral Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in.
__label__non-neutral I mean, that guy with the toe thing?
__label__neutral Who's he sleeping with?
__label__neutral Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...
__label__neutral I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.
__label__non-neutral Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-!
__label__neutral So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.
__label__neutral So where did you study?
__label__neutral Oh, I didn't go to college.
__label__neutral No, where did you study acting?
__label__neutral Molly ... people don't study acting ...
__label__neutral Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
__label__neutral Sure, I'll go check on Emma.
__label__neutral Thanx.
__label__sadness Will the stable boy never get the princess??
__label__disgust What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here    on my couch?
__label__non-neutral No ... the leather sticks to my ass.
__label__anger You know, this isn't fair.
__label__anger What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?
__label__non-neutral Huh?
__label__anger Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?
__label__non-neutral Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?
__label__sadness I didn't think I could ever love again.
__label__non-neutral Come on! Joe!
__label__neutral Ok
__label__neutral Hi, is Molly here?
__label__neutral Yeah, come on in. Molly?
__label__neutral Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha .  I'll see you tomorrow.

__label__anger Im next!
__label__anger Its my turn!
__label__anger Its only fair!
__label__anger And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me Im going to sue you!
__label__anger Not this hospital, Im going to sue you!
__label__non-neutral And my husband  hes a lawyer!
__label__neutral Uh Rach

__label__fear Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that oneDude! Theyre all huge!
__label__non-neutral They dont look any bigger than me!

__label__neutral Im just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Hi.

__label__neutral No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportive like crazy.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral We just want you to think it through.
__label__neutral Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody whos had a baby. Like your mom?
__label__neutral My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
__label__neutral Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
__label__neutral Thank you. All right.
__label__neutral Come, sit.

__label__neutral No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
__label__neutral Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
__label__neutral That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
__label__neutral Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
__label__neutral Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
__label__non-neutral Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
__label__neutral Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
__label__non-neutral You betcha!
__label__surprise Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
__label__neutral When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
__label__anger That cup is mine!
__label__anger No its not! You want it, youre gonna have to win it!
__label__non-neutral All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
__label__non-neutral Why?
__label__neutral Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
__label__neutral I know I do.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Guess what?
__label__neutral What?
__label__joy They published my paper.
__label__joy Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
__label__non-neutral Rach, look!  Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.  There he is.
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
__label__neutral Oh.
__label__anger What?! You got us evicted!!
__label__anger I told you not to go down there!
__label__disgust Well he made Rachel cry!
__label__anger Rachel always cries!
__label__anger Thats not true!
__label__neutral Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like youve never sucked before!
__label__neutral All right! Ill try! But if I cant, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
__label__anger Go!!
__label__neutral All right, all right, all right.
__label__neutral I mean Ill have to check with him first, but Ill think hell be cool with it.
__label__non-neutral So, hes just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesnt want anything in exchange for helping him?
__label__neutral Well, I assume Ill have to take showers with him, but y'know, thats true of any job.
__label__neutral How ya feelin?
__label__neutral Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it.
__label__neutral Whered you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
__label__joy Woooo hoooo!!!
__label__non-neutral Ow, no woo-hooing, no woo-hooing.
__label__surprise Why, what happened?
__label__non-neutral Ah, I fooled around with Joeys sister.  Well, thats not the worst part.
__label__neutral What is the worse part?
__label__non-neutral I cant remember which sister.
__label__anger You see what men do! Dont tell me men are not nice!  This is men!!
__label__non-neutral Whats wrong with you?
__label__anger Nothing!
__label__sadness Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.
__label__neutral But um, I dont think its anything serious.
__label__surprise This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-youGo to the doctor!
__label__anger No way!
__label__non-neutral Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
__label__disgust Why did I have to start working out again?
__label__anger Damn you 15s!
__label__neutral Its a trifle.
__label__neutral Its got all of these layers.
__label__neutral First theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.
__label__non-neutral [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like somethings wrong.]
__label__neutral then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
__label__disgust It tastes like feet!
__label__joy I like it.
__label__surprise Are you kidding?
__label__neutral Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
__label__neutral No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
__label__joy Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
__label__joy Oh, oh! It's on again!
__label__disgust You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
__label__anger Shhhh!
__label__neutral Folks, has this ever happened to you.
__label__neutral You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
__label__non-neutral Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!
__label__neutral And there is Kevin.
__label__non-neutral Can we please turn this off?
__label__non-neutral Noo way, Kevin.
__label__neutral There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
__label__surprise Are you intrigued?
__label__joy You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
__label__non-neutral Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.
__label__neutral Go ahead.
__label__neutral This works with any milk carton.
__label__surprise Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.
__label__neutral Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay.
__label__non-neutral She is not  Shes gay. Oh my God. She is
__label__surprise Good day for married people huh?
__label__sadness Im sorry your husband cheated on you.
__label__non-neutral Im sorry your wife is gay. I guess women arent that great either.
__label__non-neutral Try telling my wife that.
__label__neutral Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
__label__joy I can't wait to be with you!
__label__neutral I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.
__label__neutral I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
__label__non-neutral Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
__label__non-neutral Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
__label__disgust Arghh!!
__label__non-neutral I cant believe Im going to lose this job!
__label__sadness Oh Im so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
__label__neutral Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
__label__neutral Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__anger Well, I dont want to talk to you Wayne!
__label__anger I hate you!
__label__anger You ruined my life!
__label__neutral Oh, Chandler, Wayne.
__label__neutral Wayne, Chandler.
__label__neutral Hi, how are ya?
__label__neutral Joey, Joey, I-I-Ill g-get you your job back if you help me out.
__label__non-neutral Why should I help you?!
__label__neutral The reason he just said.
__label__neutral What do you need?
__label__neutral I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, yknow Sarah?
__label__surprise What?
__label__neutral And I too am just a love machine.
__label__neutral Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
__label__surprise Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out its a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
__label__joy See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
__label__surprise You chipped in?!
__label__neutral Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
__label__surprise Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, but they didn't ask me!
__label__non-neutral Y'know?
__label__joy This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger.
__label__joy That's always fun to be.
__label__anger Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
__label__neutral No I'm not.
__label__surprise No!
__label__non-neutral If anything I'm making you look better!
__label__joy They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
__label__joy Oh hey, Pheebs!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Oh hey, Ross.
__label__fear Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people.
__label__neutral Something to think about.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, okay, my bad.
__label__neutral Alright, alright, alright...
__label__neutral Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
__label__neutral For what?
__label__joy Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
__label__disgust Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
__label__joy Thank you!
__label__neutral Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
__label__non-neutral He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
__label__disgust C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!
__label__neutral I warned you...
__label__anger Who is being loud?
__label__neutral Oh, that would be Monica.
__label__neutral Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
__label__surprise Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
__label__neutral Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
__label__surprise Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
__label__neutral No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it.
__label__neutral 'Kay?
__label__neutral Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life?
__label__neutral Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
__label__neutral Sure.
__label__neutral Oh, um, Chandler?
__label__neutral Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
__label__joy Hey Monica, it's Joey!
__label__joy Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
__label__neutral Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
__label__neutral Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?
__label__neutral Do you have a dressing room?
__label__neutral Do you have a chair with your name on it?
__label__neutral Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on.
__label__neutral Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong!
__label__fear Uh-oh!
__label__neutral I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
__label__neutral Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
__label__joy Everybody smile!  Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at
__label__surprise Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
__label__non-neutral Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
__label__surprise Wow, you guys, this is big.
__label__non-neutral Pants and a sweater?
__label__non-neutral Why, mom?
__label__non-neutral Who am I gonna meet in a blackout?
__label__non-neutral Power company guys?
__label__non-neutral Eligible looters?
__label__non-neutral Could we talk about this later?
__label__neutral OK.
__label__neutral Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma.  What's my number?
__label__neutral Well, I never call
__label__neutral What cha doing?
__label__neutral Having a swim.
__label__neutral What about the chick?
__label__neutral Chicks dont swim.
__label__neutral Are you sure?
__label__neutral I dont know. Should we try it?
__label__neutral Sure.
__label__neutral See, I told you they dont swim.
__label__neutral Wait. Give him a minute.
__label__fear Noo!  Oh, its okay, its okay, baby, baby, baby.
__label__neutral Me taking care of you is no problem, huh?
__label__neutral You guys feel safe.
__label__neutral Right?
__label__neutral Okay, Im gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!"
__label__neutral Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, Ill set you up with a clean one.
__label__sadness Okay, Im sorry.
__label__sadness I didnt mean to scare you.
__label__neutral I just have to clean that up.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral Cause lets face it, were at Monicas.
__label__non-neutral I broke it.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__neutral Well, thats just the way that goes.
__label__neutral Okay, good.
__label__non-neutral Why are there only two of you?
__label__non-neutral Where is Leslie?
__label__neutral Well, you cant answer.
__label__neutral Leslie?
__label__fear Where are you Leslie?
__label__non-neutral Leslie, now would be a
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
__label__neutral Oh, theres banana on it.
__label__non-neutral You said she was bald.
__label__neutral Yeah, she was bald, shes not now.
__label__surprise How could you not tell me that she has hair?
__label__neutral I dont know, I hardly ever say that about people.
__label__anger Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
__label__non-neutral Well Im sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got
__label__non-neutral Well, maybe it wont work out. Maybe Ross wont like her personality.
__label__neutral Why, does she have a bad personality?
__label__non-neutral Oh no, Bonnies the best!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__fear Do you have a minute? Id like to talk to you about something Im, Im really uncomfortable talking about.
__label__non-neutral Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
__label__non-neutral I actually had a topic in mind! Im, Im kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
__label__surprise Whoa, for like months?
__label__joy Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff yknow, sexually?
__label__surprise No!
__label__neutral Oooh, wrong answer.
__label__non-neutral Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay.  Oh, shhh!
__label__non-neutral No! No!! Its me! Its me! I-I didnt want to make any noise!
__label__non-neutral Then don't break in!!
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
__label__neutral I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
__label__disgust Then why are you smoking?
__label__non-neutral Well its very unsettling.
__label__neutral Honey, I was wondering....
__label__neutral Hmm?
__label__non-neutral Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
__label__non-neutral Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
__label__neutral Hmm.
__label__non-neutral I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
__label__non-neutral You remember not having sex in high school, right?
__label__sadness Yeah.
__label__neutral Well honey, what about you?
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
__label__neutral No.
__label__surprise Come on you gotta have one!
__label__disgust Ugh!
__label__non-neutral I dont know Monica.
__label__non-neutral It feels funny just being here.
__label__non-neutral I mean if you buy a bed from Janices ex-husband, thats like betraying Chandler.
__label__non-neutral Not at these prices.
__label__joy Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.  Woo!
__label__joy Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
__label__surprise Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandlers your friend...  Oh!
__label__surprise Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
__label__joy You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
__label__non-neutral Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
__label__anger By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
__label__neutral That's OK.
__label__surprise Oh, are you sure?
__label__surprise Really?
__label__anger Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
__label__neutral We can't do that.
__label__surprise What? What can't you do?
__label__surprise She really said that?
__label__neutral Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...
__label__neutral But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
__label__surprise 'Tonight' tonight?
__label__joy Well, I think it's perfect.
__label__neutral Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
__label__non-neutral I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
__label__joy Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
__label__disgust Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
__label__neutral Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
__label__neutral No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
__label__joy Alright, well, be good, I love you.
__label__anger You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
__label__sadness O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
__label__anger Really stupid.
__label__non-neutral Really stupid.
__label__non-neutral And I don't even know how it happened.
__label__sadness I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.
__label__fear Are we okay now?
__label__anger Yeah. No. No...
__label__neutral Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
__label__neutral Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
__label__surprise You're kidding.
__label__neutral No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
__label__neutral Oh there it is.
__label__neutral Thats not your regular dry cleaners.
__label__disgust I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one.
__label__disgust I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral A new grocery store.
__label__non-neutral The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and thats what they gave me?
__label__anger When I get up there Im going to kick some ass.
__label__neutral Dont worry Phoebe, youre gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
__label__neutral Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
__label__neutral Oh, you didnt have to come in with me.
__label__non-neutral Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__surprise Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s Wow!
__label__surprise What?
__label__surprise Im sorry, its just that youre so incredibly beautiful.
__label__neutral Oh yeah well, Im sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?
__label__non-neutral I hope you dont think Im crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
__label__neutral A little.   Now youre talking.
__label__neutral Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
__label__joy I-I-Id love to. Let me just tell my friend.
__label__joy Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
__label__neutral She mustve left.
__label__anger Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
__label__surprise Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
__label__joy That's right baby.
__label__neutral All right, let me in.
__label__non-neutral No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral He's a dropper!
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah, that's right!
__label__anger I'm not a dropper!
__label__neutral It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
__label__non-neutral It's throwing and catching!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__surprise Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
__label__non-neutral Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
__label__surprise Oh myOh good God!
__label__non-neutral I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
__label__neutral Baking it didn't help, huh?
__label__neutral All right, well the place was closed. Ill just copy it later.
__label__non-neutral Or not. Uh, Rach, why dont you just move in with me?
__label__surprise Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
__label__neutral No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no Its okay, I mean Ilook Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursdays thing, but we dont have to do that!
__label__neutral Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless youre thinking about Naked Wednesdays.
__label__joy Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
__label__joy So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
__label__neutral Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
__label__non-neutral Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
__label__disgust Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
__label__neutral I was shrieking... like a Marine.
__label__neutral All right here. Watch me execute the three Ps of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.
__label__neutral She's not much of a phone person.
__label__neutral Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
__label__non-neutral Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
__label__neutral Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
__label__non-neutral Maybe you should.
__label__non-neutral Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
__label__neutral You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
__label__neutral Oh, that is so not true.
__label__neutral Oh, it is.
__label__neutral It isn't.
__label__neutral It is.
__label__anger Isn't!
__label__neutral Okay ladies, that ends todays class, and lets remember, lets be safe out there.
__label__joy Its a great class.
__label__neutral Thanks.
__label__neutral Yeah, yeah, I was watching.
__label__neutral Umm, hey, a couple of questions though.
__label__non-neutral Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
__label__neutral Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them
__label__non-neutral No. No-no. No. What would
__label__surprise Who? Me the attacker?
__label__sadness Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you.
__label__sadness Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
__label__surprise No-noReally?!
__label__non-neutral Of course!
__label__sadness Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh
__label__sadness Ohh, Im sorry.
__label__neutral Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
__label__non-neutral What?! Anything! Anything!
__label__neutral Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.
__label__non-neutral This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
__label__surprise Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
__label__neutral Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later.
__label__neutral Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over here. All right, come on
__label__non-neutral Hey, you guys. Listen, Im sorry that I was hogging the game beforeOh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
__label__neutral Theyre all Chandler.
__label__surprise Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good!
__label__neutral I did.  But it came at a price.
__label__fear But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.
__label__surprise Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!
__label__joy Sure!
__label__neutral Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?
__label__joy With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!
__label__joy And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!
__label__neutral Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much.
__label__joy Well, I like that idea.
__label__joy Obviously!
__label__neutral I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow?
__label__neutral I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like
__label__disgust No.
__label__non-neutral Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely."
__label__disgust Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
__label__surprise So, thats it?
__label__neutral I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
__label__neutral Which is why
__label__anger What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
__label__non-neutral I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
__label__non-neutral Are you mocking me?
__label__neutral No, Im not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.
__label__joy Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
__label__joy Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
__label__neutral Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but
__label__neutral Cat.
__label__joy Yes! You are so smart!  I love you.
__label__joy I love you too.
__label__non-neutral I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
__label__surprise Why?
__label__neutral I don't know.
__label__joy This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
__label__neutral That's
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has
__label__neutral But
__label__disgust No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
__label__neutral Okay. Okay, but you cant fire him today.
__label__non-neutral Why not?!
__label__non-neutral Because Im dumping him today.
__label__surprise What?! You said he was sweet!
__label__neutral He
__label__neutral Just dont pick up your phone.
__label__disgust Then he comes over!  "Im so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
__label__surprise What? So now Im not allowed to fire him?
__label__non-neutral You cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill himself.
__label__neutral Okay well then, Ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
__label__disgust Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill
__label__neutral Okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it!
__label__non-neutral Okay. But the question is whos gonna go first. Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
__label__non-neutral Really? Thats the thing Im worse at! Youll see.
__label__neutral This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
__label__sadness Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
__label__sadness Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone?
__label__neutral Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
__label__neutral Oh. Well, Ill right you everyday.  15 Yemen Road, Yemen.

__label__non-neutral I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
__label__neutral No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
__label__joy Well, I then guess Im going to Yemen! Im going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?

__label__non-neutral All right, bye!
__label__non-neutral They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
__label__sadness Sorry.
__label__sadness Im sorry Joey.
__label__surprise Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
__label__neutral Its so secluded up here.
__label__joy I know. I like it up here.
__label__non-neutral I feel like were the only two people in the world.  Oops. Sorry.
__label__non-neutral Whats the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
__label__fear No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-Iwould youactually, would you go check on that?
__label__neutral Honey, we dont have any bears here.

__label__neutral Diet Coke
__label__non-neutral What the hell was that?!
__label__neutral A lesson in the importance of unagi.
__label__neutral Ohh,
__label__neutral Perhaps. Now Im curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to
__label__neutral All right, so we werent
__label__neutral Im sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but Ilook, I just want you guys to be safe.
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral Im leaning. This is where I lean.
__label__neutral Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
__label__fear Brenda a bee!
__label__surprise What?
__label__non-neutral Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
__label__disgust I think I know whats going on here.
__label__neutral You do?
__label__disgust Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its wrong. Youre married.
__label__neutral I totally understand.  Can I
__label__joy All right, let's do it!
__label__surprise No, no, no. What was that?
__label__neutral I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
__label__non-neutral Well, people!
__label__neutral People, people, people.
__label__neutral Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey.
__label__neutral Show 'em how it's done.
__label__neutral Count it off.
__label__neutral So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
__label__disgust Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and hes so cheap, hed never fly to London in a million years.
__label__neutral Yeah, invite him?
__label__neutral Hey, did I do these neat enough?
__label__neutral Yeah, theyre fine.
__label__non-neutral Yeah?
__label__surprise If anyone asks, well just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
__label__neutral Sure. Why not?
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__non-neutral I dont think Id be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
__label__fear Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldnt invite her?
__label__non-neutral Oh, no-no, yknow I absolutely adore Rachel its just that, well it might be a awkward for you.
__label__neutral But its absolutely your decision.
__label__neutral More tea?
__label__neutral Yeah sure.
__label__neutral Earl Grey?
__label__non-neutral Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hey! So how was the doctor?
__label__joy Oh, everything went great.
__label__neutral Good.
__label__neutral Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
__label__non-neutral Oh.
__label__neutral I dont see the baby. Where is it?
__label__non-neutral Oh no, I know I couldnt see it either at first, but its right umm  Ross, I lost it again.
__label__non-neutral Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
__label__neutral Excuse me?
__label__neutral Could you help me with something?
__label__neutral The patient Im looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.
__label__neutral And umm, hes like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
__label__neutral I think I know who youre talking about.
__label__joy Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
__label__neutral Im sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff
__label__neutral Uh, shes with me.  Dr. Drake Remoray.
__label__neutral Dr. Drake who?
__label__neutral Remoray. Its Portuguese. We need that information; Im a doctor.
__label__surprise A doctor at this hospital?
__label__anger Damnit woman were losing precious time! Now do you want this mans blood on your head?
__label__neutral Hands.
__label__neutral Hands!
__label__neutral It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in.
__label__neutral Hes a patient of mine, Ive been treating him for years!
__label__neutral Hes in room 816.
__label__joy 816, thank you!
__label__neutral Thank you.
__label__neutral And what is his name?
__label__surprise No!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
__label__non-neutral Awww.
__label__joy Thanks a million.
__label__joy Oh, youre welcome a million.
__label__neutral Okay, Ill see you in our room.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__neutral Okay, I gotta go.
__label__surprise Whoa! What?! Why?!
__label__sadness Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
__label__surprise Here?! Now?!
__label__neutral Well, yeah.
__label__fear I cant-I cant stay here all night, and if I go in there shes-shes gonna wanna... do stuff.
__label__surprise What happened?
__label__sadness Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago.
__label__joy Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
__label__anger Stupid, useless Canadian money!
__label__neutral Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Will you call him?
__label__joy Yes!
__label__joy I will!
__label__joy Absolutely!
__label__neutral (She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other.
__label__neutral She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in
__label__joy Oh my God! That is so good!
__label__neutral Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral What do you got there?
__label__neutral Oh its umm, its tofu cake. Do you want some?
__label__neutral What are you doing tonight?
__label__neutral Huh? Uh
__label__surprise Dude! Dude!
__label__neutral Oh!  Sorry. Uh, Ive got those plans with Phoebe, why?
__label__surprise Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
__label__surprise What?! Tonight?!
__label__neutral Thats what Monica said.
__label__surprise After she gave me that big speech?!
__label__anger She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?
__label__anger I think shes trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
__label__neutral Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
__label__disgust Who cares? I repel women.
__label__surprise No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Its yours!
__label__non-neutral Yeah well, Im-Im a slut.
__label__neutral Me too.
__label__joy Hi Jill!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Hi .
__label__neutral Rachel.
__label__surprise Rachel! Well, you-youre not at home, youre-youre-youre right here.
__label__non-neutral Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But its not!
__label__neutral Okay. So well Ill umm,  Ill have her home by midnight.
__label__non-neutral That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
__label__sadness I'm sorry, man.
__label__neutral Hey, y'know what you should do?
__label__neutral You should make something happen for yourself.
__label__neutral Y'know, like-like write a play.
__label__joy Write a movie!
__label__neutral Huh?
__label__neutral I mean, what about those
__label__sadness Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
__label__joy Wait a second, I could star in it!
__label__neutral Or that.
__label__non-neutral I can't write!
__label__sadness Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?
__label__sadness I can't do it.
__label__neutral I'll help you.
__label__neutral Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.
__label__neutral And plus, it'll give me something to do.
__label__neutral Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
__label__neutral Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope thats cool.
__label__neutral Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.
__label__neutral Although, I should probably tell you, shes a porn star.
__label__neutral Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good.
__label__neutral All right.
__label__non-neutral As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
__label__neutral Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt have to apologize.
__label__neutral I would really love it if I could do both.
__label__non-neutral All right, II have to ask.
__label__neutral What?
__label__fear Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
__label__surprise What?!
__label__anger Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
__label__disgust A hundred and forty-five pounds.
__label__non-neutral Yes, yes it is. Its uh  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
__label__non-neutral Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me?
__label__anger Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didnt bring you here so you can ambush her.
__label__neutral Frannie was the one who found your
__label__anger That bitch!
__label__surprise Monica! What
__label__anger Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
__label__neutral Hi Frannie, congratulations.
__label__anger You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!
__label__surprise Why?!
__label__non-neutral WhatWhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding?
__label__non-neutral What could I have possibly done?!
__label__anger Stuart!
__label__neutral I believe you know my husband.
__label__neutral So its really a question of
__label__non-neutral Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
__label__surprise Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
__label__neutral Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
__label__surprise Yeah?
__label__neutral It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
__label__neutral What's up?
__label__neutral Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk.
__label__neutral Man to uh, me.
__label__neutral Sure. Okay.
__label__surprise Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
__label__neutral Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
__label__neutral You mean scared.
__label__neutral No, I mean happy.
__label__joy Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
__label__sadness Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in.
__label__surprise What do you mean, theyre not moving in? They-theyre still moving in right?
__label__neutral No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
__label__surprise What?! Over a stupid room!
__label__joy Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but Im also really psyched cause I dont have to move in here!
__label__joy Oh no, yeah no, that parts great!
__label__neutral Yes
__label__surprise Shut-out!!
__label__surprise Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
__label__non-neutral Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
__label__anger Yeah, get out!
__label__anger You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!
__label__anger Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?
__label__anger Come on, wussies!
__label__neutral All right, ok, I gotta go.
__label__neutral I'm going,  and I'm gone.
__label__neutral One more game?
__label__joy Oh yeah!
__label__sadness Im sorry.
__label__sadness Ohhh. Dont go.
__label__non-neutral No, I-I-I gotta go.
__label__non-neutral No. No! No! No!
__label__non-neutral Honey, honey, people are looking.
__label__anger I dont care!  I dont care!!
__label__non-neutral Yeah, um, Im, Im leaving now.
__label__non-neutral You cant leave! I have your shoe!
__label__non-neutral Good-bye Chandler Bing.
__label__neutral Rachel has those in burgendy.
__label__disgust Oh, ew!
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you.
__label__neutral Um, can you roll your tongue?
__label__neutral Because I can, and my Mom couldnt, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
__label__neutral What, wait, you mean like this?
__label__surprise Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
__label__neutral Your not doing it.
__label__neutral Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I cant. We dont have that....
__label__neutral Where there is no fear of commitment.
__label__neutral Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
__label__neutral Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.
__label__neutral But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.
__label__fear It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!
__label__neutral If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.
__label__neutral Right.
__label__neutral In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
__label__non-neutral Amazingly, that makes sense.
__label__neutral You think?
__label__joy Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
__label__fear Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
__label__joy Hey!  Hey!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__joy Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
__label__joy Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
__label__neutral Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
__label__neutral Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
__label__surprise Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!
__label__non-neutral Im missin picture time?!
__label__anger Yknow she has a face Ross!
__label__non-neutral Okay. Okay, heres a good one of us.
__label__joy Wow!
__label__joy That is a good one!
__label__joy Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card yknow, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
__label__neutral Yknow, every year I say Im gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it.
__label__neutral Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?
__label__surprise Together? Like-like to people?
__label__joy Yeah, yknow. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. Itll be cute, okay?
__label__non-neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?
__label__neutral Uh sure, sure.
__label__neutral Bye guys.
__label__non-neutral I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
__label__non-neutral You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve got a girlfriend?
__label__neutral Is this about Mark?
__label__surprise Oh my God.
__label__neutral Okay, its not, its not.
__label__non-neutral Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
__label__neutral Fine, youre right.
__label__neutral Lets ah, lets take a break,  lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
__label__non-neutral No. A break from us.
__label__non-neutral Bing! Were all set for tonight, 8 oclock.
__label__non-neutral Oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. Monica has to work.
__label__non-neutral Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
__label__neutral Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.
__label__non-neutral Oh? Why not?
__label__neutral Its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament.
__label__non-neutral Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
__label__non-neutral Well now-now youre just talking crazy.
__label__neutral So why cant the three of us go out together?
__label__sadness Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
__label__non-neutral Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.
__label__joy And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
__label__anger Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
__label__neutral Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this.
__label__joy Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club.
__label__anger Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.
__label__neutral Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.
__label__neutral It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.
__label__anger : Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!
__label__neutral It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
__label__neutral What are you doing?
__label__neutral Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy.
__label__neutral Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.
__label__neutral There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.
__label__neutral Did he call?
__label__sadness No. Sorry.
__label__non-neutral Why?! Why?! He said hed call. Why hasnt he called?
__label__neutral Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
__label__non-neutral Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasnt he called, Rachel? Why?
__label__neutral Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
__label__surprise Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
__label__neutral Well...
__label__non-neutral The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you?
__label__neutral No. I...
__label__anger Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
__label__non-neutral And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?
__label__non-neutral I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion!
__label__anger Is that too much to ask after six years?!
__label__non-neutral I mean what?
__label__non-neutral Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!
__label__non-neutral I mean do we not have as much fun?!
__label__non-neutral Dont I deserve a few tears?!!
__label__non-neutral I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__anger I did not cry my eyes out!!
__label__non-neutral Come on!
__label__sadness Its like the end of an era!
__label__sadness No more J-man and Channies!
__label__non-neutral !
__label__non-neutral Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
__label__neutral Do I know why were rushing?
__label__neutral Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
__label__neutral Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.
__label__joy Oh, I found it!
__label__surprise !
__label__joy Thats so great for you guys!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Good luck, with your girlfriend.
__label__joy Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!
__label__neutral Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
__label__neutral Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
__label__neutral So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
__label__joy Yes, you can, very much.
__label__surprise Ahhhh!!
__label__non-neutral Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
__label__neutral Do
__label__neutral Ah,
__label__neutral Do
__label__neutral Ah,
__label__non-neutral DO YOU?
__label__non-neutral Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was a beautiful speech.
__label__disgust Oh, come on.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__joy All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!
__label__neutral And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.
__label__neutral And what you said about Nana.
__label__non-neutral Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there.
__label__neutral And you know what?
__label__neutral I think she was.
__label__surprise Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
__label__neutral You forget how many great songs Heart had.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
__label__non-neutral So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
__label__neutral Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but Im not even sure I got it.
__label__neutral What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey.
__label__neutral And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.
__label__non-neutral You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
__label__neutral Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
__label__anger I cant find garbage bags!
__label__neutral Oh, I think I saw some in here.
__label__surprise What is it?!
__label__disgust I dont know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itll die.
__label__non-neutral I cant believe were living here!
__label__surprise You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really  proposing?
__label__non-neutral No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.
__label__surprise Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it  look like?!
__label__non-neutral I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of  it.
__label__non-neutral Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
__label__sadness Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don't want to hurt her.
__label__neutral Okay, look, just do it gently.
__label__neutral You're right.
__label__neutral You're right.
__label__neutral I-I'll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I'll be gentle.
__label__neutral I can do that.
__label__neutral I am a gentle person.
__label__neutral Oh, by the  way.
__label__neutral Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.
__label__neutral Hi, Pheebs?
__label__neutral Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
__label__non-neutral What?!
__label__non-neutral Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England.
__label__neutral Which
__label__neutral How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
__label__neutral Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
__label__neutral Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
__label__joy Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which
__label__joy Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here
__label__anger You completely stole my answer!
__label__non-neutral Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
__label__anger Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
__label__neutral What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
__label__neutral I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
__label__neutral Would ya care to venture one?
__label__neutral Would
__label__anger Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
__label__neutral Are you just repeating what
__label__neutral All right, let's move on.
__label__neutral Okay then.
__label__neutral All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.
__label__neutral And-and when she comes in hopefully, she wont recognise you because, well, why would she?
__label__neutral Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.
__label__neutral You be Mr. Gonzalez, and Ill be uh, Mr. Wong.
__label__neutral Diverse.

__label__joy Hell yeah! Ill marry you!
__label__anger You cant marry him!

__label__neutral Hello.
__label__non-neutral Hi! Its me.
__label__joy Hi! Oh, Im so glad you called.

__label__neutral Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
__label__non-neutral Yeah! Got it!
__label__non-neutral Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
__label__non-neutral Ah, thats okay, thanks.
__label__neutral Hey, you dont have to smile. You just have to dance.
__label__non-neutral Look, I dont feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
__label__neutral Oh, okay.  Hey, two beers.
__label__neutral You wanna go in the bedroom? Its a little more comfortable.
__label__neutral Sure.
__label__surprise Okay.  Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
__label__surprise If this is your idea of sexy talk?
__label__non-neutral No seriously, yknow the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
__label__neutral What contracts?
__label__non-neutral Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I dont get.
__label__neutral Like what?
__label__disgust Yknow, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?
__label__anger Tag!
__label__anger Im serious!
__label__anger This isnt funny!
__label__anger Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
__label__surprise Rach, Im sorry, but you didnt give me any contracts!
__label__anger Yes I did! And I put a little
__label__neutral Im telling you, you never gave them to me.
__label__anger Yknow what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
__label__non-neutral No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are
__label__disgust Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
__label__neutral You wanna go down to the office right now?
__label__anger No! Come on its late, were not gonna go down to the office.
__label__neutral Okay I understand.  I wouldnt want to be proved wrong either.
__label__joy Okay get your coat!  Oh! When did you unhook this?  Nice work!
__label__neutral Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this    is my good friend Ross.
__label__neutral Nice to meet you.
__label__neutral Oh and I need to talk to you.
__label__neutral About what?
__label__neutral To see if know what these guys are talking about.
__label__neutral Pheebs, hows it going?
__label__neutral Im doing okay. I think its going well. Do you think theyre having fun? Am I talking to fast?
__label__joy Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, its going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
__label__neutral Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before?
__label__neutral Oh right, Coach Ruben.
__label__neutral Do you know what Pheebs?
__label__fear When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
__label__neutral Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
__label__neutral See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
__label__surprise What do you mean?
__label__anger Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
__label__anger Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
__label__surprise Uh, what was that?
__label__neutral Uh,
__label__neutral ...I'm, I'm okay.
__label__neutral That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral Bye.
__label__joy Whoo-hoo!
__label__joy Yeah, there you go!
__label__joy Second date!
__label__neutral ...I dunno.
__label__neutral You
__label__non-neutral Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay?
__label__disgust I mean,... how needy is that?
__label__neutral Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
__label__joy You're so pretty.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__neutral Hey, Phoebe.
__label__neutral Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
__label__surprise You talked to him. Are you crazy?
__label__joy Thank you, Happy Holidays.
__label__anger Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't  Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
__label__non-neutral Hey!!
__label__fear The charity's on fire!
__label__fear Help!
__label__joy Oh good!
__label__joy Thank you, I need that.
__label__surprise Whoa!
__label__surprise What is that?!
__label__surprise It's nine o'clock in the morning!
__label__neutral Can I help you?
__label__neutral Uh yeah, where-wheres the guy who decides whos pictures go up on the wall?
__label__neutral Hes not here right now.
__label__anger Oh, youre kidding me!
__label__neutral All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes.
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__neutral Im an actor; Im kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
__label__neutral Yknow, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
__label__neutral Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  Youre the other one right?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
__label__surprise What?! Youre crazy! Theres nothing sexual about the noises I make!
__label__surprise Really?
__label__non-neutral Theres nothing sexual about this?
__label__non-neutral Oooh.
__label__non-neutral Oo God!
__label__non-neutral Ohh.
__label__non-neutral Ohhhh.
__label__non-neutral Ohh.
__label__non-neutral What are you looking at?!
__label__neutral I mean hi.
__label__non-neutral Oh myThis is so embarrassing. Oh my God, Im never gonna get massaged again!
__label__non-neutral No, you cant let this stop you from getting massages!
__label__neutral No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Well not clients, lovers. But lets just yknow, try it again. Come back and-and well work through it.
__label__surprise Are you sure?
__label__neutral Yes.
__label__neutral I guess.
__label__joy Great! Okay, if youll just excuse me.  So, did you hear something you liked?
__label__non-neutral Noo!!!
__label__non-neutral Yes!
__label__non-neutral Noo!!
__label__non-neutral Yes!!
__label__fear Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk!  That they know of.
__label__neutral Okay, heres the thing. Were gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that youre drunk.
__label__non-neutral Really?! You promise?
__label__neutral Yeah, Ill take care of it.
__label__joy Okay. I love you so much.
__label__neutral Okay we have to do something about your breath.
__label__surprise What about
__label__neutral Thats still yours. Okay, now remember its a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
__label__neutral Okay. I can do that.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__surprise Surprise!!!
__label__neutral Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.
__label__neutral Yeah, were done.
__label__surprise Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
__label__joy Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
__label__joy Sweet!
__label__neutral All right, well finish your coffee; lets go.
__label__disgust Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
__label__neutral Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight.
__label__non-neutral I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
__label__sadness Im sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby
__label__neutral So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
__label__non-neutral Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.
__label__neutral Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
__label__joy She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
__label__joy Oh, what a fun office.
__label__neutral I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.
__label__neutral So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
__label__neutral Rachel? Do you smoke?
__label__neutral Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror storiesabout ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral Peach pit.
__label__neutral Yes, Bunny?
__label__neutral Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
__label__neutral -Peaches?
__label__neutral Actually, nectarines, but basically...
__label__neutral Could've been a peach.
__label__neutral Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.
__label__non-neutral Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!  What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
__label__joy All right!
__label__joy Westminster Abbey!
__label__joy Hands down, best Abbey Ive ever seen.
__label__joy Hey!
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
__label__neutral I think its great. Its great. Yknow, theyre thinking of changing the name of this place.
__label__surprise Really? To what?
__label__non-neutral To Put the Camera Away!!!
__label__neutral Man,
__label__surprise Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And
__label__neutral Chandler, theres a guy right over there.
__label__surprise Thats a mailman! Thats
__label__neutral Chandler, dont worry! This doesnt make you any less of a guy!
__label__neutral Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
__label__neutral Hmm.
__label__non-neutral Eh..., I dont, I dont know.
__label__neutral What?
__label__non-neutral Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
__label__neutral Rachel?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
__label__non-neutral Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
__label__neutral Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
__label__non-neutral Eh, do you believe that?
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__non-neutral Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
__label__neutral No, you said the baby creeps you out.
__label__non-neutral No, the little girl creeps me out.
__label__neutral You said the baby.
__label__non-neutral Why would the baby creep me out?
__label__non-neutral Why would the little girl creep you out?
__label__neutral You guys, Im sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
__label__surprise This is going in your book?
__label__joy Yeah, its about relationships. Yknow? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
__label__surprise What?! Excuse me!
__label__neutral And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.
__label__neutral And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as its a compliment.
__label__joy Yeah!!!!
__label__joy Yes, I made it!
__label__joy Im on time!
__label__neutral Okay, why dont we all uh,  open our books to page 23.
__label__neutral Where  Where you will seea uha bunch of uhred spots.
__label__neutral Okay,  umm, why dont, why dont you all start to read, while I
__label__non-neutral Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
__label__non-neutral Ross! What are you I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
__label__neutral Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
__label__surprise What the? What
__label__non-neutral Hi!
__label__neutral Miss? May I help you?
__label__non-neutral Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay?
__label__neutral But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.
__label__sadness So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
__label__neutral It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
__label__neutral Do you want me to be afraid of you?
__label__neutral Of course not.
__label__joy I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.
__label__non-neutral I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
__label__surprise Really?
__label__neutral Of course!
__label__non-neutral Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
__label__neutral All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit
__label__anger Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is
__label__disgust A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
__label__non-neutral Ooh, it's not a toy.
__label__sadness Well, I don't know what else to do.
__label__non-neutral I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!
__label__non-neutral So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!
__label__non-neutral 'Cause I-I got nothing!
__label__non-neutral All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.
__label__neutral Okay then.
__label__neutral Here we go.
__label__non-neutral Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?
__label__neutral Ask again later.
__label__anger Later is not good enough.
__label__neutral Ask again later.
__label__anger What the hell!
__label__anger This is broken!
__label__anger It-it is broken!
__label__neutral All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
__label__neutral Excuse me.
__label__neutral Yeah?
__label__neutral Are you Phoebe Buffay?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__joy Can-can I get your autograph, Im your biggest fan.
__label__neutral I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
__label__joy Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
__label__non-neutral No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
__label__neutral Come on, two on one.
__label__surprise What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
__label__surprise What, now?
__label__joy Yes, now is when you swoop!
__label__joy You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not!
__label__non-neutral You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
__label__neutral My Catholic friend is right.
__label__neutral She's distraught.
__label__neutral You're there for her.
__label__joy You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
__label__neutral Well, I just called Joshua
__label__non-neutral Oh, how did it go?
__label__neutral Well, I did my best to convince him that Im not some crazy girl who is dying to get marriedIm just going through a hard time.
__label__neutral What did he say?
__label__non-neutral Well uh, his answering machine was
__label__non-neutral Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that hes gonna call you again.
__label__sadness Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care.
__label__sadness I dont think hes the one Im sad about.
__label__sadness Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well.
__label__sadness Yeah, maybe.
__label__sadness And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
__label__non-neutral Any luck?
__label__sadness Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?
__label__sadness I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
__label__non-neutral Again. Yknow what? I think we all did.
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__surprise I dont get it!
__label__non-neutral It was in my room all night!
__label__non-neutral And if she didnt take it, and I didnt take it; and you  didnt take it, then who did?
__label__anger Shh!
__label__anger Were trying to think!
__label__neutral This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__joy Oh yeah!
__label__neutral I got in there myself once.
__label__neutral My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldnt, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__non-neutral It was funny til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
__label__neutral No, you, you cant fit in that thing. Thats not deep enough.
__label__non-neutral Oh yeah?  If I cant, Ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
__label__neutral All right, you have yourself a deal.
__label__surprise Okay.  See?! I told ya!
__label__non-neutral Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
__label__neutral Hey! Whats up?
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__joy Hey-hey, whos your friend?  Hey!!
__label__joy Hey Joey!
__label__joy Erin! Still here!
__label__joy Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
__label__joy Why wouldnt ya? Erin is great! Then-then theres you guys.
__label__joy Ohh, listen. Ive got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
__label__non-neutral I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
__label__neutral Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__surprise Ohh!
__label__neutral Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral I mean you definitely should do that.
__label__joy Y'know what, I should do it.
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
__label__neutral Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
__label__neutral All right.
__label__non-neutral Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
__label__anger This woman's living my life.
__label__surprise What?
__label__anger She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!
__label__non-neutral Look at this, look.
__label__non-neutral She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.
__label__non-neutral She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.
__label__non-neutral She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
__label__neutral You're not an artist.
__label__non-neutral Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
__label__surprise I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
__label__non-neutral No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
__label__neutral I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
__label__non-neutral Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
__label__surprise I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
__label__disgust Oh, that is so sick.
__label__disgust I feel violated. And not in a good way.
__label__surprise How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
__label__joy Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
__label__non-neutral I know. My arm is killing me.
__label__neutral No, I meant with the dropper over here.
__label__anger Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm
__label__neutral Hey Rach, can you pass me the
__label__neutral Yep!
__label__joy Go!!
__label__surprise What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
__label__non-neutral Okay! Okay! Okay!  We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
__label__surprise Oh!
__label__joy Hey!
__label__joy Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
__label__joy Oh, thanks, thanks.
__label__neutral So Monica tells me that uh, you dont want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent.
__label__neutral Is that true?
__label__neutral Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
__label__neutral Pheebs
__label__non-neutral Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
__label__non-neutral What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here.
__label__neutral Whats the matter?
__label__neutral Nothing.
__label__non-neutral What is it? Hey!
__label__sadness Really its nothing. Im just
__label__neutral Rach come on, what?
__label__sadness Ive just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
__label__surprise What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
__label__sadness Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
__label__neutral Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
__label__sadness Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right?
__label__neutral Yeah, I guess so.
__label__sadness I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
__label__surprise Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?!
__label__joy I just found out this is Chandlers office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!
__label__non-neutral Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
__label__anger We said seven!
__label__anger We said six!
__label__neutral The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.
__label__anger Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!"
__label__joy Hi!
__label__disgust Oh my good God.
__label__disgust Ugh!
__label__non-neutral I know what time you said.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
__label__anger You, get out of my shop!
__label__surprise Well, what did he do?
__label__anger He went out with my wife!
__label__surprise Joey!
__label__non-neutral Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-IHey! I did
__label__anger Thats my wife!!! Get out!
__label__neutral Well, we should go.
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport.
__label__neutral Oh please.
__label__non-neutral Every moment is precious.
__label__neutral Yknow?
__label__non-neutral Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.
__label__neutral Well, were really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
__label__non-neutral On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane.
__label__non-neutral No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.
__label__neutral Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
__label__neutral Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
__label__neutral So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.
__label__neutral We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
__label__joy Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.
__label__surprise Yeah?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Just go for it Chandler.
__label__neutral Yeah, you should.
__label__neutral Yeah, you should, really.
__label__neutral Go on.
__label__neutral All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. But Im just doing it for you guys.
__label__non-neutral : Im sure as hell a dancer, its no use Marge will never go for me.
__label__non-neutral Come on Treeger, dont say that.
__label__neutral You just ahh, you just need more practice.
__label__neutral Here, come on, lets ahh, lets try it again.
__label__neutral Come on.
__label__non-neutral Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.
__label__non-neutral I mean, yknow, Im not really that comfortable dancing with a We-he!!
__label__non-neutral Hey!
__label__non-neutral : Yeah!
__label__neutral Oh, I
__label__neutral Are you sure? Ill bet theres another flight to Minsk in like
__label__neutral July. Umm,
__label__non-neutral Thats really beautiful. What does it mean?
__label__neutral Please, clean my beakers. I dont get out of the lab much.
__label__non-neutral Thats good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
__label__neutral Yeah, I Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldnt because yknow, Ihave to leave.
__label__non-neutral Youre right! Youre right. Dont say it.
__label__non-neutral I-I do though.
__label__non-neutral I do too.
__label__neutral Bye Phoebe.
__label__non-neutral Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
__label__neutral I know.
__label__surprise Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that?
__label__non-neutral Listen, Im gettin something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
__label__neutral No, I do not hear that.
__label__joy Yeah, I-I heard.  I think its great!  Ohh, Im so happy for you!
__label__joy Oh, well, thats great!
__label__joy Yeah! Yeah!
__label__joy I cant believe youre getting married!
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__neutral Monica and Rachel made out.
__label__surprise Ohhh!
__label__surprise Why are we in bed together?
__label__neutral I dont know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral No!
__label__fear But we-we didnt havesex-uh, did we?
__label__neutral I mean, I dont remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
__label__joy Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
__label__neutral And we didnt have sex.
__label__neutral Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. Im just glad we didnt do anything stupid.
__label__neutral Tell me about it.
__label__neutral What are we gonna do?
__label__neutral I say we go with
__label__neutral Chandler?
__label__neutral Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
__label__non-neutral Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
__label__disgust Whats that smell?
__label__non-neutral I know!
__label__neutral Hi, remember us?
__label__neutral Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a
__label__neutral I am. I'm
__label__neutral Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
__label__sadness Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
__label__neutral Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
__label__neutral Yknow what? It
__label__neutral Sorry.
__label__joy Im so exited!
__label__joy Ive been waiting for this for months!
__label__joy I got my hair coloured!
__label__joy I got new sheets!
__label__joy Im making him a
__label__neutral Um-hmm.
__label__neutral What am I making him by the way?
__label__neutral Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
__label__surprise I thought I was making him filet mignon?
__label__neutral Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.
__label__non-neutral And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
__label__surprise Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
__label__non-neutral Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!
__label__non-neutral Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated.
__label__neutral Yknow its like uh, Biology!
__label__non-neutral Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
__label__neutral Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.
__label__non-neutral Phoebe!
__label__neutral If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes probably not gay.
__label__neutral You are falling fast asleep.
__label__neutral Deeper.
__label__neutral Deeper.
__label__neutral Deeper.
__label__neutral You are now completely asleep.
__label__neutral You dont need to smoke.
__label__neutral Cigarettes dont control you.
__label__neutral You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
__label__neutral A strong, confident woman.
__label__neutral Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller.
__label__joy Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
__label__neutral Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
__label__non-neutral Of course not.
__label__neutral No.
__label__neutral Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
__label__neutral So how are things going with Paul?
__label__joy Good.
__label__non-neutral Although yknow, he-hes a private guy.
__label__sadness Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
__label__neutral Thats easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wont open.
__label__surprise So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
__label__neutral No thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
__label__neutral Hi honey.
__label__joy Hi!
__label__fear Okay, Ben, I wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident.
__label__surprise Monica, number one, I dont think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!
__label__neutral You said number two.
__label__neutral I also said number one.
__label__neutral Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
__label__neutral Cant I just look at the handles on them?
__label__neutral You would think.
__label__neutral Okay, fine.
__label__non-neutral Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why Im a terrible waitress?
__label__neutral Because, I dont care.
__label__neutral I dont care.
__label__non-neutral I dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I dont care where the tray spot is, I just dont care, this is not what I want to do.
__label__non-neutral So I dont think I should do it anymore.
__label__non-neutral Im gonna give you my weeks notice.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__non-neutral Gunther, I quit.
__label__surprise Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee?
__label__non-neutral Ohh, I mean its just so realistic!
__label__neutral I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.
__label__joy Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
__label__neutral Do you uh, do youready for a refill?
__label__surprise Oh, I probably shouldntso I will!  Oh! Wow! Its like its raining!
__label__joy Pretty cool, huh?
__label__neutral But if youre thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldnt get sucked up into the mechanism, well youd be wrong.
__label__neutral Umm, can I use your bathroom?
__label__neutral Its uh, right through there.
__label__non-neutral Okay.  God yknow, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbianis apartment
__label__joy Yeah, lifes pretty great isnt it?
__label__joy Yeah, it sure is!
__label__neutral You know, I think I was sixteen.
__label__neutral Please, just a little bit off the back.
__label__neutral I'm still on "no."
__label__neutral Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
__label__anger No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.
__label__neutral What's goin' on?
__label__neutral Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
__label__non-neutral What stupid thing did you do?
__label__disgust Ewww!
__label__neutral I know.
__label__neutral See, yes.
__label__neutral Thats Yasmine Bleeth, shes a completely different kind of chick.
__label__neutral I love you both.
__label__neutral But in very different ways.
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__neutral (sees hes watching
__label__non-neutral I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
__label__non-neutral If they cant find a home for her, they kill her! And Im not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
__label__non-neutral Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
__label__disgust Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of other animals!
__label__disgust Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
__label__joy Thanks, Im glad you see it that way.
__label__joy Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
__label__neutral So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
__label__non-neutral Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
__label__neutral So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
__label__neutral Ohh, he's really shy. I-I dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
__label__neutral Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
__label__non-neutral I dont care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
__label__surprise Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?
__label__neutral I might've said that.  Why is that funny?
__label__joy Because I'm very happy for him!  And
__label__non-neutral Hi!
__label__neutral All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral All right, let's go say good-bye.
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__anger Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?
__label__disgust Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
__label__surprise Fish!
__label__neutral It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
__label__sadness Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here
__label__joy Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
__label__joy We did have fun, didn't we?
__label__joy We did!
__label__neutral Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
__label__joy Oh, I would love to!
__label__joy Yay, okay!
__label__joy Good, good, good, good, good.
__label__neutral Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
__label__neutral Um...  Done!
__label__surprise Youre, hey, youre not paying for the pizza!
__label__neutral Oh come on, its only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
__label__neutral Ahh, Id throw another thousand on that.
__label__neutral Why, how much is that?
__label__neutral Thats about 60 cents.
__label__neutral Okay, its coffee.
__label__surprise Ice coffee? Tell me its ice coffee!
__label__neutral Its-its hot
__label__surprise Hot coffee!!!
__label__anger You idiot!!
__label__anger You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!
__label__anger What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?!
__label__non-neutral Huh?
__label__anger !
__label__neutral Whats your favourite thing about summertime?
__label__neutral Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
__label__neutral Yeah
__label__surprise Hey!
__label__joy Tommyyyy! Say, whats your favourite thing about summer?
__label__neutral Ooh, I dont know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
__label__non-neutral Ohh, thats a good one.
__label__neutral OK, try this salmon mousse.
__label__joy Mmmm. Good.
__label__neutral Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
__label__non-neutral It's creamier.
__label__neutral Yeah, well, is that
__label__disgust I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
__label__surprise My God! What happened to you?
__label__disgust Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?
__label__non-neutral "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
__label__joy That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
__label__non-neutral Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really
__label__non-neutral Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
__label__joy Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
__label__neutral Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
__label__neutral I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
__label__non-neutral Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
__label__neutral Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
__label__neutral I don't see why not.
__label__neutral Here's my retainer!
__label__neutral Someone in there?
__label__non-neutral No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.
__label__surprise Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
__label__neutral Someone was in the lady's room, I couldnt wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
__label__neutral Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, Im-Im talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name.
__label__neutral Ginger.
__label__neutral Ginger. Im talking to Ginger, so....
__label__neutral Dont you have to use the bathroom?
__label__neutral Nope, nope, Id just ah, Id rather talk to you.
__label__neutral Yes, I do.
__label__neutral Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
__label__neutral Someone in here.
__label__anger Im going to keep dating him Mother, and theres nothing you can do about it!
__label__anger Oh yes there is!
__label__anger What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
__label__anger That was an accident! And so were you.
__label__anger Well, at least Im not a murderer!
__label__non-neutral Oh, my baby!
__label__surprise That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
__label__neutral Oh, just years of experience.
__label__non-neutral Can I get some ice here?!
__label__joy Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
__label__non-neutral Youre not the fan whos dying are you?
__label__surprise Say what?
__label__neutral Im supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying, but thats not supposed to be until  later!
__label__non-neutral No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-Im the guy in the coma!
__label__surprise Oh that was a real person?!
__label__non-neutral An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
__label__surprise I-I-Im leaving the show?
__label__neutral I dont know. Why? Did you hear something?
__label__surprise Who told you that?
__label__non-neutral Oh uh, one of the writers.
__label__surprise Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
__label__neutral Umm
__label__neutral Feel better?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy Much!
__label__non-neutral Listen uh, not that Im yknow insecure about my manhood or anything yknow, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
__label__neutral Yeah, I understand.
__label__joy Yeah! Okay!  Hey! Hi!
__label__joy Hi!
__label__surprise Yknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
__label__neutral I dont think so.
__label__non-neutral Oh! Maybe its because Im on television. Im an actor on
__label__surprise Wow!
__label__neutral Yeah.
__label__surprise Really?!
__label__neutral Hm-mmm.
__label__neutral $4.50 please.
__label__neutral Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.
__label__neutral Alright, alright, alright.
__label__non-neutral It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word.
__label__non-neutral Oh God, do something.
__label__non-neutral Just make contact, smile!
__label__joy There you go!
__label__non-neutral You're definitely scaring here.
__label__neutral Would you like to call somebody?
__label__neutral Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.
__label__anger Okay! Feel free to look, but Im telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
__label__neutral Oh
__label__neutral Its my sister.
__label__neutral Okay, very cute braces. Anyway yknow what, the
__label__non-neutral So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
__label__neutral In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a
__label__neutral Phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, she doesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know that youve been living with your Grandmothers for a week now.
__label__neutral Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__sadness Im never gonna find a roommate, ever.
__label__neutral Why, nobody good?
__label__disgust Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural.
__label__disgust The spitter.
__label__non-neutral Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.
__label__neutral Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing
__label__neutral So how many more do you have tomorrow?
__label__neutral Two.
__label__neutral This photographer, who seemed really dull.
__label__neutral And this actor guy, who Im not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone Chandler Bing, he said Whoa-whoa, short message.
__label__neutral Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
__label__non-neutral Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
__label__neutral What?
__label__neutral I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
__label__neutral Umm, hows it going with you guys?
__label__neutral Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
__label__surprise Oh, really?
__label__joy Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesnt really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think its gonna make a difference
__label__neutral Hey!
__label__neutral Hi!
__label__non-neutral What-what are-what are these?
__label__joy Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought theyd brighten up the place. They do dont you think?
__label__non-neutral No-no-no, no!
__label__neutral Well, how-how come?
__label__neutral Thats just the way it is.
__label__surprise Thats crazy.
__label__neutral Maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.
__label__neutral See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now Peter!
__label__neutral Hey, Peter!
__label__neutral Its me Rhonda!
__label__neutral From PS-129!
__label__non-neutral I shared my puddin which you man!
__label__neutral I gave you my
__label__neutral I-I think everybodys pretending they dont hear you.
__label__neutral Anyway, look, I dont know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, Im telling you, he
__label__neutral Thats okay, Im cool over here. Ill catch up with you later, Joey.
__label__neutral Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.
__label__neutral Hows that coffee comin, dear?
__label__neutral Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
__label__neutral Im not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
__label__non-neutral I know!
__label__surprise Ill bet your thinking, Whats an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee? Eh?
__label__neutral Op.
__label__non-neutral Eh.
__label__neutral Oh, you got me.
__label__neutral Well, dont think I havent noticed your potential.
__label__neutral Well, Ive got a project for you thats a lot more related to fashion.
__label__neutral How does that sound?
__label__joy Oh, that sounds great.
__label__neutral Come on over here, sweetheart.
__label__joy Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
__label__fear Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe youd want to get back together?
__label__neutral No. But thanks.
__label__sadness Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
__label__neutral Okay. No. But thanks.
__label__neutral Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
__label__surprise Wow, that was kinda brutal.
__label__neutral Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.
__label__neutral Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, yknow.
__label__neutral Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,
__label__neutral Yeah, sure.
__label__surprise Wow.
__label__neutral I'm, I'm really sorry.
__label__neutral Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
__label__surprise Relieved?
__label__neutral Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
__label__neutral She wants
__label__anger Oh my God! If you say that one more time,
__label__anger Fine!
__label__anger Fine!
__label__anger But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  If you accept full responsibility...  Full responsibility!
__label__anger ...I can begin to trust you again.
__label__anger Does that seem like something you can do.
__label__anger Does it?!
__label__anger !
__label__surprise No?
__label__neutral Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel.
__label__neutral If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
__label__sadness Yeah, I know.
__label__sadness I mean, no, youre right.
__label__neutral Yeah I guess Ill let it go.
__label__sadness But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
__label__neutral Sure, its hard to forget!
__label__neutral But that doesnt mean you have to talk about it!
__label__neutral A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.
__label__surprise What the hell happened on that beach?!
__label__neutral Its between us and the sea, Ross!
__label__non-neutral I didnt think you were gay. I do now.
__label__neutral See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
__label__sadness Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious.
__label__neutral Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
__label__surprise Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
__label__neutral Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
__label__joy Oh wow! Im free for her!
__label__surprise Oh, wait a second! I didnt say I wasnt free!
__label__neutral Hey, Chandler, why dont we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
__label__neutral Hold on, yknow I
__label__non-neutral Oh well, thats uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
__label__neutral Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
__label__neutral Well, I dont really know what that is, but
__label__neutral Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
__label__neutral Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
__label__disgust Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
__label__surprise What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
__label__neutral What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
__label__anger Joey, get out of the fridge.
__label__non-neutral All right, all right.
__label__surprise What is that?
__label__neutral For the ride.
__label__neutral Yeah, like in a cab...
__label__neutral Save it.
__label__disgust Okay, hating this.
__label__neutral Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
__label__joy I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
__label__disgust That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
__label__non-neutral All right, I'm going. I'm going.
__label__neutral Here we go, here we go.
__label__neutral Rossy, Rossy.
__label__non-neutral WHAT IS IT?!
__label__non-neutral Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
__label__neutral Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
__label__neutral Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
__label__non-neutral Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
__label__surprise Oh my God! Calling from Rome!
__label__neutral So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
__label__non-neutral Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome.  I'm talking to Rome.
__label__non-neutral Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
__label__non-neutral So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
__label__non-neutral Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
__label__neutral Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
__label__surprise You know it?
__label__neutral Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
__label__neutral Oh, sure, they love us over there.
__label__joy Ben! Ben! Ben!
__label__anger Gimme em!
__label__anger No! They are mine!
__label__anger You stole them from me!
__label__anger You stole them from me!!
__label__anger Gimme them!
__label__neutral You just wanna each take one?
__label__neutral Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
__label__non-neutral Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
__label__neutral Well
__label__neutral Why dont you phase it out?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think youre, yknow, that youre adjusting to life in America.
__label__neutral Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean theyre probably not even listening!
__label__surprise Theyre not listening too me?
__label__neutral Of course theyre listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
__label__non-neutral Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
__label__neutral I think you look fine.
__label__neutral How about Joey... Pepponi?
__label__neutral No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
__label__neutral Joey... Switzerland?
__label__neutral Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.
__label__non-neutral Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.
__label__neutral Which I'm not.
__label__non-neutral Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
__label__neutral Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
__label__neutral Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
__label__non-neutral Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
__label__neutral Might wanna try Joseph.
__label__non-neutral Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
__label__joy Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
__label__surprise Are you kidding?
__label__neutral Okay, look.
__label__non-neutral I-I studied evolution.
__label__non-neutral Remember, evolution?
__label__non-neutral Monkey into man?
__label__neutral Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey.
__label__non-neutral Im Doctor Monkey!
__label__neutral Im not arguing with that.
__label__non-neutral All right, Ive heard enough. Ive made my decision.
__label__disgust You are both idiots.
__label__disgust The joke is not funny, and its offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys!
__label__anger You shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!
__label__anger Now let it go!
__label__anger The joke sucks!
__label__neutral Its your joke.
__label__anger Is not.
__label__non-neutral Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
__label__joy I didnt!
__label__neutral Even when I found outumm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
__label__non-neutral Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
__label__surprise Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
__label__neutral Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and
__label__non-neutral Did you, did you
__label__neutral No.
__label__non-neutral Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
__label__joy Yes!
__label__anger Then don't touch one!!
__label__surprise Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__joy Thanks!
__label__neutral All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
__label__joy Done!
__label__non-neutral And it can't be Joey.
__label__neutral It's not.
__label__neutral Or Joseph.
__label__non-neutral Oh.
__label__neutral Hi!
__label__joy Hi! Hey, Pete youre back! Hey, check this out.
__label__joy Wow! Skates!
__label__surprise Wow! Youre a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was youre trip?
__label__neutral Well...
__label__non-neutral Oh, whatd ya bring me?!
__label__non-neutral Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan.
__label__joy Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection.
__label__neutral You want some coffee?
__label__neutral Yeah, sure, thatd be great.
__label__neutral Regular or decaf?
__label__neutral Ah, which ever is closest.
__label__neutral Okay.
__label__neutral So ask me what I did today.
__label__neutral So what did you do today Pete?
__label__joy I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
__label__surprise What?! Oh.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__neutral Where've you been?
__label__neutral At the vet.
__label__fear She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
__label__non-neutral She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
__label__joy Hey! He beat ya.
__label__sadness She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
__label__neutral So what does this mean?
__label__sadness I'm gonna have to give him up.
__label__anger Aww man! I cant believe I locked myself out again!
__label__non-neutral Hang on buddy!
__label__surprise Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
__label__neutral I sure did.
__label__surprise But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
__label__non-neutral Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
__label__neutral May I come in?
__label__neutral Uh, yeah, if you want too.
__label__neutral Do
__label__neutral Yeah, sure?
__label__neutral So do I.
__label__neutral Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.
__label__neutral This is just about tonight.
__label__neutral I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us."
__label__neutral Okay?
__label__non-neutral I just want this to be  about what it is!
__label__non-neutral And um, what-what is that Ross?
__label__joy The physical act of love.
__label__surprise What?! Are you crazy?
__label__surprise Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
__label__surprise Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
__label__non-neutral You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
__label__non-neutral Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
__label__non-neutral No! No!  No!  No-no-no-no.
__label__surprise Ohh wow! Im sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
__label__neutral Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
__label__fear It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's gonna kill me.
__label__neutral Yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there.
__label__neutral Ah Joey.
__label__neutral Joey Tribbiani.
__label__neutral Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
__label__non-neutral So, does that mean the audition is off?
__label__neutral Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
__label__surprise What?!
__label__neutral Aw come on Joey, it's easy.
__label__neutral Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
__label__non-neutral It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
__label__neutral Have fun.
__label__neutral Bye.
__label__surprise Wow! Fortunately she has a
__label__surprise Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
__label__surprise Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!
__label__surprise !
__label__neutral Hi there.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral Hi.
__label__neutral I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__neutral Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!
__label__neutral So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
__label__anger Oh, DAMN IT!
__label__neutral Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
__label__neutral Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.
__label__neutral Ok.
__label__neutral Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
__label__non-neutral Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
__label__non-neutral We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
__label__joy Yeah! C'mon!
__label__neutral Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
__label__neutral Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
__label__neutral No, she's at a faculty meeting.
__label__neutral Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...
__label__neutral Come in.
__label__neutral Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
__label__neutral What's it look like?
__label__neutral Kinda like a big face without skin.
__label__neutral Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
__label__surprise Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
__label__neutral Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
__label__joy Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
__label__neutral Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
__label__surprise The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
__label__non-neutral What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
__label__surprise You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
__label__neutral I have no idea what you just said.
__label__neutral Put Joey on the phone.
__label__non-neutral What's up man?
__label__fear I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth
__label__non-neutral Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Chandler, listen.
__label__neutral Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
__label__neutral and that was all before 10 oclock.
__label__neutral The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.
__label__neutral And then the florist phoned to say there arent any tulips.
__label__neutral Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.
__label__neutral Were not gonna be
__label__surprise Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?
__label__anger Well, up yours too!
__label__neutral Wheres Chandler?
__label__surprise Ah, he cant make it, he said he had to his...  Whoa-oh!
__label__neutral Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
__label__neutral Joey I can see you okay? Youre hiding behind the coats.
__label__neutral Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
__label__non-neutral Well, if you dont have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
__label__non-neutral Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
__label__joy Yeah! You wanna come?
__label__joy Yeah!
__label__neutral Fine.
__label__neutral Fine.
__label__neutral Fine.
__label__neutral Fine.
__label__neutral All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
__label__neutral Hey.
__label__non-neutral Whats the matter?
__label__disgust Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
__label__surprise Oh Willies still alive!
__label__neutral What are you guys doing?
__label__non-neutral Oh, my mom called, theyre gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so were looking for a good picture of us.
__label__neutral Oooh, Im afraid that does not exist.
__label__surprise Thats not true, there are great pictures of us!
__label__neutral No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whos going like this
__label__surprise Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the
__label__sadness I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture.
__label__joy Oh, heres a great one.
__label__neutral Yeah, Im not in that.
__label__joy I know, but look at me: all tan.
__label__neutral Hey, why dont you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.
__label__joy Thats a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Yknow
__label__neutral Yeah thats great! Next to that, Chandler wont look so stupid.
__label__neutral Chandler what do you say?
__label__neutral All right, but I should warn you, Im not going. Im going.
