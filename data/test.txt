Yeah, but this is
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
I don?t want him to tell this story for years.
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
I wasn?t escaping.
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
You were trying to eat it!
If
Come on.  Hello?  I?m sorry you have the wrong number.   Okay, I?ll call you later dad. I love you.

Oh yeah!? Oh, I can do that.
Really?
I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
My god, what happened?
These new kids, they never last.
Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'.
Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
Sure.
Oh my God Phoebe, you?re on fire!

Oh hi Ben?No!! Don?t look at the machine!
Feeling a little better sweetie?
Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Me too.
Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Kidney stones!
Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now.
Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra
Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option?what's a urethra?  Are you crazy?!
So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
Yeah.
Good-good-good.
Oh-oh!
Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
What?
Beth is really, really sick.
Awwww.
Jo?s there, but I don?t think there?s anything she could do.
Joey?
Yeah.
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
Okay.
Okay.
You okay?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah!
Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice.
And now I know.
Aww...
Big day.
Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they?re hungry.
All right so, so what do I do?
This is Rachel.
I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again?
I mean I know it?s weird, it?s awkward, but you gotta at least try.
Yeah. Okay.  Whoa!  I almost forgot this was on your
We didn?t play it!!
Oh God Monica hi!
I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.
This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Hi, sure!
Hi.

But it is our apartment!
No it?s not!
You guys! You guys! You?re gonna have a baby! They?re gonna have a baby!
MY SISTER?S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!
Okay, but this can?t be good for the baby.
Oh!
Hey, Rachel.

You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin? ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday
Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.
Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
Yeah?
Yeah. I?ll let you play with my duck.
Rachel?
Yeah.
I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_
No!
Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.
Okay.
So umm, are we cool?
Okay.
I knew you'd understand.
Hi everyone.
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
The exclamation point in the title scares me.  Y'know, it's not just
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
No I don?t have a ring!

What took you so long?
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Oh, good.
So, thanks for having me over! Rach.  Pheebs.
See ya!!  What the hell was that?!
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
That's not European!
Well, it felt French.
Morning?s here! The morning?s here!
Hey! You?re back!
Hey!  Get into gear!
Breakfast is near!
I?ll see you tomorrow morning!
Okay!
Okay, Andre should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye.  Just easier that way.
Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
No, forget it.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
Me either...
Every night!!
You do not need to smoke.
Cigarettes don?t control you.
You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh,  he will have a white wine spritzer.
Woo!
Hey, look at that, the airport?s moving.
Hey, are we moving?!
Are we moving?
Why are we moving?
Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we?re moving?
Oh my God.
Oh, my gosh.
They?ve been quiet for a long time.
Maybe she killed him?
Let?s go.
Is that your new walk?
No, I really have to pee.
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Uh-huh
Why is everything different?
Bye!
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Why?
Why? Because of the government.
Hi!
Where did you get those jeans?!
You gave them to me!
Oh sure?And hey, don?t get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just?I miss?hanging out?just-just us, y?know?
Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we?ll make time to hang out with each other.
You got it. Come here.
Oh God! Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys.
She?s a hooker! She?s a hooker! She?s a?  Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone.
The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
Mmm-mm.
I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash.
So-so what I am saying is - is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge!
I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
So you uh, nervous about getting married?
What are you doing?
Forget it.
I-I?Y?know what?
I?ll just have the conversation.
I?ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best.
What do you think Rach?
I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.
What else? What else?
Uh, well he?s 33.
Oh. Ah-uh.
A widower.
Oh.
He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he?s not into anything weird sexually.
Enter Pheebs.
So that?s why I feed my dog
That?s where you pick up the bag.
Exactly.
No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah,
No.
Yeah, okay.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
How is Monica, I love your sweet ass, inappropriate?
How?s Monica coming along with her vows?
Well let?s just say its.. she?s lucky she has a sweet ass, ?cause she?s not so good at the writing.
Did not.
I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
How was that possible?
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing?
Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
Hey Toby, you got a sec?
Sure, what?s up?
I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but I just found out its not gonna happen.
Apparently somebody thinks I?m not eleventh floor material.
Say uh, who the
I?ll be a fool for you. I?m sure, you know I don?t mind
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
I know
I know
I?ve found
I?ve found....
...in you, my endless
You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry.
Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
This?
Uh-huh.
Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker...
She wasn?t a hooker.
Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be.
Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh?
Oh that?s all right sir, and that?s just one girl.
Bing?What?s this?!
It?s a hand. It?s a thing you use as a
No, it?s a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We?re gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!
Oh no-no-no!
Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y?know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.
Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
Arghhhhhh!!
It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
I'm over here big guy.
Yeah, you are!  I scared you!
Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding?  Guys?
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
Alright, what?s going on?
I?m sorry. I?m sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we?re gonna have younger looking skin!
Yeah!  Y?know, she could use a little?  Oh nice shot!!!
Hey, Monica!
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
You had sex, didn't you?
How do you do that?
Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex!
You know Paul?
Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
Ok if everyones on board, its settled, Chandler,   Chandler?
Yep.
Are you on board?
Yes.
Then, problem solved. Chandler will be running our office  in Tulsa. Youre gonna love Oklahoma.
Rachel!! Monica!!
Come on!
I can?t believe this!!
All right well, y?know?I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Yeah, I guess we don?t have a choice.  Help us! Please help us! We?re stuck up on the roof and we can?t get down!!!
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
I know, I wasn?t finished.   But don?t worry! We?re gonna go down the fire escape!!
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
Oh, how well you know me...
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
How'd you pay for them?
Uh, credit card.
And who pays for that?
Um... my... father.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Hi Steve!
Hello, Monica.  Hello, greeter girl.
This is Rachel.
Yeah, OK.
Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of  of, OK, smells.
It's a lovely apartment.
Yes! My baby?s finally free!
All-all right!  Start it up! Let?s go!
Woohoo!
How hot are we?
You wanna buy a car?
No.
I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great.
So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.
Oh.
I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do.
It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?
Hey.
Hey.
Oh.  Sorry!
No-no-no, y?know what?
I really shouldn?t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn?t cool.
And if it makes you feel any better, I?ve had a really lousy day.
Me too.
Yeah?
Noo!! I?ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
Umm, well, what else could it be?
It's kidney stones.
Or?
Kidney stones!
Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
You think?!
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
I can't believe that didn't work!
I know, me neither! I mean, you
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
Well, I bet you are all thinkin' Now would be a really    great time for an intermission, huh?
oh yes, God yes!!
Well, you're not gonna get one!
Because in    life there are no intermissions, people.
Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word.
I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
Grab a spoon.
Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon?
Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
Great story!? But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...? Oh man,
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Right.? Thanks.? It's June.? I'm outta here.
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
Okay, and oh I?m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.
Hey Ross, what?s going on? You changing the lock?
No. That guy is.
I don?t understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then you change the lock.
Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you?re-you?re sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?
I?m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
What?
I love you!
Ohh!  And I love spending time with you.
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
He's right, enough, already.
What is the big deal about today?
So you slept with her for the first time, so what?
You slept with her for seven years after that.
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
How can you say that?! The
What about Benitez?
What about Game 1 of the Series?
What about shut up?
That was you?
Oh I, I don?t-I don?t think that would be the best idea.
What time?
Gotcha.
Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
Hey Pheebs.
Hey!
Any sign of your brother?
No, but he?s always late.
I thought you only met him once?
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, ?Frank?s always late.?
Well relax, he?ll be here.
No, I know, I?m just nervous.
Y'know it?s just y'know Mom?s dead, don?t talk to my sister, Grandma?s been sleeping a lot lately.
It?s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing.
You?re so sweet to wait with me.
Well, actually Gunther sent me. You?re not allowed to have cups out here, it?s a thing.
And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all    that stuff is because he thought it was important to you.
You know, that's the    kind of guy Joey is.
He is very sweet. Plus he's
That was going to be my next argument.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
You're ready?
Yeah, let's go.   Thanks    Ross.
Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me    up.
Glad I could help man.
Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna    be, but...  I made it work.
Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
I know.
What, so what are you gonna tell him?
Well, I told him I would think about it, but I?m gonna tell him no.
Huh.
I mean I think I?d say no to anybody right now.
Oh, but it was so strange.
I mean I?m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who?s asking me to go out with him, which I?m allowed to do, and I felt guilty.
Y'know, like I?d be cheating on Ross or something.
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you?re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
I don?t have any issues with my Father.
Okay, so it?s probably just the Ross thing then.
I don?t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.  Draw!!
I wasn?t doing anything.  Uh-oh, what did she do now?
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she?s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
God, I just, I hate her!
I hate her!!
With her, ?Oh, I?m so talented.? and ?Oh, I?m so pretty,? and ?Ooh, I smell so good.?
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
I?m talking about you. You big, big freak.
Oh.  Ohh. Ohh, you?re out of your mind.
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours!
If you were in a school yard you?d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know.
Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we-  Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm a waitress.
Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
Yeah. Gotcha.
I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
Ok. That's fine.
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
I?m here to see Mary-Angela.
You are so the man!
Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, ?cause my Grandma doesn?t know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off.
She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.
Yeah.
Where?s Mary-Angela?
She?s right in there.
Morning.
Actually he?s the smallest person in the world.
Heard about the leg burnin? huh?
It came up.
Listen, I ah, I know it?s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
Airplane
Oh, time's up.
Bye... bye...
What's a 'niffle'?
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'?
Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
Nooo!
Ok, I dont wanna be negative so Ill say that most of the  signs you bought are good.
No they ran out of Its a girl but I can fix this one,  See?
So  sexy.  Honey.
Yea yea.
Honey why dont you go lie down.
No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta  go to the office  Am I producing  them?
Whyre you so tired?
Couldnt sleep last night you know, then I started worrying  about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried  about it the more I couldnt sleep.
Yknow?
I was like, if I fall asleep  now Ill get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now Ill get five hours  sleep.
Not matter what I did I couldnt fall asleep.
You know what you shouldve done, you should have told yourself  that little story.
Hi!
Hi, welcome home!
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
Helen Geller? I don't think so.
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
Thank you!
Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
There's nothing to wonder about, Monica.
You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Not necessarily...
Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Really? Then why are you like that?
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed!
Y'know that old guy that lives next to me?
Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop.
But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies.
Then I felt wonderful.
That old jackass!
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
But the minute we start to lie to each other?  And by 'we' I mean society.
There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
Sure.
Yep?
Sure, I?ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
Sure, okay.
Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
What?
I don?t want you to see me naked!
Rachel, I?ve seen you naked a million times.
I ate hot fudge off you naked.
Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
Nah-ha!
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
Oh, I wish I?d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Oh that?s okay.
Hey, actually in a way it?s kinda nice.
Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night.
What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
What, are you crazy?
You haven?t beaten me once since my injury plagued ?97 season.
It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Okay, you?re on.
Okay, let?s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
It?s not a big deal. It?s, just it?s right here,  and it?s all the time.
Well, thanks again for lunch.
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
No honey, I?m sorry, but the weekend?s not over yet.
Oh.  Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
I guess they?re back from their date.
Music. Very nice.
Oh my God!
So, how are you?
I am good. I finished my book.
Oh yeah, what?s it about?
I don?t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Yeah, I do.
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Isn?t the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
Shhh!
This is a museum, no talking.
Right down here,  we have a large foot.
Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller.
Everyone wave ?Hi? to Ross.
Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work.
Okay, moving right along.
Come on.
I can't believe it! We're here!
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Oh, you should live with Joey,
Come here.  Okay, be right back.
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
We're switching rooms.
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them!
I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.
Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Okay! I?m ready.
You sure?
Yes, I?ve done my studying and I really know my stuff.
All right then.  Rachel Green! Let?s play Bamboozled!  How do you test the temperature of the baby?s bath water?
Uh, put your elbow in it.
Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
That?s correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?
Check if it?s wet, check if it?s hungry, burp it!
Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
A card! A card! I pick a card!
Oh, I?m sorry you?ve been Bamboozled! You?re gonna be a terrible mother!  I?ve lost sight of why we?re doing this!
she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I?m not with Rachel.
Yeah.  Why aren?t you with Rachel?
Are you kidding? Look, we?re not gonna be together just because we?re having a baby. Okay?
But y?know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
Okay, stop it! I can?t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
Right. And with who again?
God. He?s crazy! Why doesn?t he want to be with Rachel?
I know!
I mean seriously, she?s like the perfect woman.
I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn?t and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and?  I haven?t bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?
Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it     Thanks for coming.
Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
Hi.
I love you!
Hey, that's why I didn't invite you.
you have to calm down, alright...    go, go get yourself a drink or something...
Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
Hey!
Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all    this? I can barely control myself.
Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where
Oh my God! Chandler!
Oh yeah.
Ahhhh?.
Ahhh??  Eh?
Uh-huh.
Hey guys!
Hey!
Hey!
Do you guys know what happened to Chandler?s barcalounger?
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Are you kidding?! I get a
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Yep.
Which?
What is the big deal?
It's weird! In a doctor's office?
It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do    it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
I cannot believe Ross told you that!     And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think    it's a good idea!
Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than    on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
OH!
Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
I hate this woman!!
I hate her!
She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks.
Okay, and whenever I can?t do it, they?re all like-like laughing at me.
Hello.
Hey!
So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
It?s possible. You are very loveable, I?d miss you if I broke up with you.  I was just trying to be supportive.
Then be supportive like a guy.
If I broke up with you, I?d miss you.
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
Yeah, okay.
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica!  Oooh, I can't leave her!
You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
That's not gonna work.
I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
Hey! I didn't know either.
Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Yeah, I knew.
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held.
Do you want people to think it's a fake conference?
It's a real conference.
Hey.
Hey!
Hey.
Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
No, she's out shopping.
Shhhhhhhhh!!!  I?m sorry, I thought maybe I?d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
With a wok?  I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Here, let me make the milk, I?m up anyway.
Hey, y?know what we can do?
Y?know, now that we are up?
We can just like talk to each other all night long, y?know like we did when we were first going out.
It?d be fun!
Okay that does sound like fun.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
The second sister dies?!
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
The second sister dies in
That?s correct.
Look at it this way:
Hey!
You're a lucky man.
You know what I miss the most about her?
That cute nibbly noise when she eats.
Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
Huh, I never really noticed.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Monica, Monica is great.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
You're shooting with Althea?!
Althea is correct.
Nice shooting!
We?ll take Literature!!
Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey?s apartment. What name appears on the address label?
Chandler gets it! It?s Chandler Bing!
No!!
I?m afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
I knew that! Rachel! Use you?re head!
Actually, it?s Miss Chinandolor Bong.
Phoebe did the signs!
Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
Look at all the stuff people sent!
Oh Ah!
Oh my gosh theres  something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire  apartment!
What are people think  Oh you guys I love it.
Hey so wheres Ross?
Hes downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the  cab.
Is he still mad at us?
Well, you more then me, but he cant stay to mad at me. I  mean, I just had his baby.
Thats not fair! I cant do that.
Yeah, Im not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
See this is what I was afraid of, I didnt think I should be  here either but somebody  said hed be over it by now.
Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
I cannot believe that you didn?t tell me that we are still married!!
Look I was going to tell you!
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn?t get the annulment; we are still married.
What?
You?re kidding!
Oh my God!!
Ross!
Okay, maybe it wasn?t my best decision. But I just couldn?t face another failed marriage.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it?s actually kinda funny.  Okay, maybe it?s best not to think about it.
Okay,
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Another lie. You have a sickness!
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you?re not married to anymore of us are ya?
So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
Um-hmm.  There we go. There it is.
Oh yeah? Fine.
Hey, y?know, y?know what would make me really happy?
Oh yeah, no, what?s that?
If like the four of us could all y?know, hang out together.
Uh, in fact Emily?s coming into town this weekend, why don?t you say we all have dinner?
Say, Sunday night?
That would be great!
Yeah, all right, it?s a date.
Hang in there. You hang in there.
Did you say something?
No, just singing.
Whenever you?re ready.
Okay. Hey, Timmy, I?ve got a surprise for you.
Hold it. I?m sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less?intense?
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Umm, jealous!
Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
Yeah, no problem.
Ross!
Sorry! Sorry! Oh,  there!  Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles
Ooh,
Condoms?
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here!
And condoms are the way to do that?
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily
Oh my God! My dog died!
What?!
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
Le Poo's still alive?!
Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh.  Oh my God.
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
It's Le Poo.
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Yeah.
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Okay, here we go...
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
There. Now there is.
All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
Not her.
Hey!
Hey!
So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
Crematorium Chris? Sure!
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
What?
Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature!
Not nature,
This is fashion?!  Okay, so to you,
I?m sorry you?re here with me instead of Roger.
Yeah, me too.
Well, I could make it seem like he?s here.
Here?s some little known facts about cous-cous.
They didn?t add the second cous until 1979.
Stop it!! That?s not funny!!
Okay.
At a fake game!!
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I?d be glad to play you for it.
But I should warn you, I am
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
No.
Hmm, let?s see if it comes up this time.
Electrifying.  Emphatic time-time-time
Y'know, there?s a
It?s so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
Thank you guys-guys-guys
Hey, aren?t you up next?
Oh no, I?m not playing tonight.
Why not?
I can?t follow Ross! It?d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed
Phoebe, Ross sucks!
Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
Oh my God, he?s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Yeah, Phoebe you?re? awful!
You guys. You suck too.
You look beautiful this evening.
Show me the badge again.
Shiny.
Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies  have been.
You are just nonstop!
We're outta here!
Why?!
Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!
You have the power to do that?
This does.
Shut it down.
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff.
But who cares?!
Because it's all on me!
That is, one big drink!
Macadamia nut?
Umm? Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Hm-mmm!
Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
Nope!
Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
I told you not to move it!
Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move your mom, and you said don?t, and I did it anyway and her
Okay, come on?Joey, I?ll buy you a new one!
All right?
We?ll go down to the store right now and we?ll-we?ll get you a new chair.
She?s not even cold yet!
But don?t you think Rosita would?ve wanted you to move on? I mean y?know, she did always put?your comfort first.
That?s true.
Okay? You ready?
Yeah, I?  I don?t want Stevie to see her like this.
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Oh.  Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Er, yeah, it's mine.
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
Wait a minute. What's his name?
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Bob Buttons?
Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
Oooh! You are a very bad man!
You owe me a cat.
Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent!
{It?s a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names.
Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.}
Congratulations.
Mazel Tov!
Hi!
Oh, great hat.
Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding.
Can you do that?
I don?t know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
Yeah! Yeah. They?re?they?re-they?re my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
Yeah, we are so sorry.
You're kinda stepping on the song.
Look, we were
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Okay,
Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
Yes! Exactly! And that's why
Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
All right.
Y'know what?
We don?t have to go downstairs!
We can bring Vegas up to us!
All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack.
Here we go.
13
Hit me!
Oohh, 23.  Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
I bet 20.
You're right!
So we can be friends who sleep together.
Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
Just your dad.  Although that?s actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister?s neighbour next Tuesday.
Oh.
You want me to cancel it?
No!  No!
Okay.
?Cause if you do that means you?d be cancelling it for me, and we?re just friends.
Exactly.
Okay, here we go.
I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face.
What?
Honey, what is it?
Did I get it wrong?
Did I get the hair wrong?
What?
Did you just picture it differently?
What?
What?
No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
Oooh, what you got there?
Pastrami.
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y?know what goes good with that?
Hm-mm, corn beef.
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that?s much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
Okay.
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
Six months.
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
Not if I get there first.
Hey! There you are!
There I am!
Are you okay?
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
What?!
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Chandler, what were you thinking?
I don?t know, but don?t worry, don?t worry, because I know how to take a picture now.
Okay, see?
Look down , look down, look down
Chandler?
Yeah!
Ooh Monica!
Hi!
Oh my God! I had the
I?I have to fire him.
But why?!
Because he?s terrible! Okay, he?s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
Well maybe he was just nervous, y?know you can be very intimidating.
And besides I?ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.
But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?
All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!
That?s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
I paid to have this done.
Love it!
OH MY GOD!!!
WHAT?!!
Are you all right?!
Yeah...
What happened?!!
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn?t take the chairs!!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn?t think big enough to fit a grown man!
So?You got in
I was tryin? to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I?m gonna do?
BEND OVER?!!!
Well, we?re a little early, the lecture doesn?t end for 15 minutes.
Yeah, but y?know we could sneak in and watch.
Yeah, we could.
Oh hey look!
There?s some Kappa Kappa Deltas!
I was a Kappa.
Hey sisters!
Wow, we really are bitches.
Right!
So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery!
What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary.
Imagine his consternation when? Oh bloody hell.
Did she call?
No, sorry.
All right, maybe I should call her.
No! Forget her, man! You don?t need her, you don?t need that!
He?s right, what she did was unforgivable.
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
How might you be wrong?
Well y'know, what if she didn?t actually sleep with the guy?
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
That?s all you?re basing this on?
That?s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There?s a lot of theories that didn?t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Oh my God!!
Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
What one?
Yeah! Y?know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Oh, isn?t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
Anyway, speaking of drinking too much.
I was uh, tellin? Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
What?
Remember?! We?come on, we both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops
Yeah?
we went back to the house and we got really silly and we?we made out.
Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you?re talking about.
Really?!
Cassie?!
Hey Ross!
Hey!
It?s been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see
Oh. Oh, that?s right. So-so you did see me that day, because it seemed like you didn?t.
I?m ready for more.
Tag
Come on Rach, let?s give it another try.
I?m having a baby.
Oh.
You can go.
Thank you.
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
He took my joke, he took it.
It?s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
You know who else picked Rachel?
Ross, and you know what else Ross did?
He stole my joke.
You know what?
I?m going to get a joke journal.
Y?know?
And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
That?s a good idea.
Yeah!
Do you know what?s a bad idea?
Picking Rachel.
Talk to me.
OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
No no no. Talk... dirty.
Wha... what, here?
Yes...
Ah....
Say something.....
Er.... um.....
What?
Um... uh.... vulva.
Hey!
How ya doin??
Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
Pretty much, yeah.
I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Well, when it?s not right, you know it.
You okay?
Yeah! Yeah. I?ll be all right.
Y?know what would cheer you up?
What?
I?m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
You?re right! That did cheer me up!
You can not do this.
Do what, do what?
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Okay, okay, I checked.
We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um..
Lemon Soother.
You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you?
Okay.
Damn
Hey, you're back!
Hey.
How was your conference?
It was terrible. I fought with  my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Hi!
Hey, you're back too!
Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Hey, how was your chef thing?
Oh, it was awful.  I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Well hello!
Where have you been?
The doctor.
Is everything okay?
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
Wow! It?s like Rachel in High School.
What?!!
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
That was an obvious joke, and I didn?t think of it.
Why didn?t I think of it?
The source of all my powers.
Oh dear God, what have I done!
Oh, I thought you weren?t coming. What? Where were you?
Come here, come here.  Okay, don?t get mad, okay.
Okay, don?t give me a reason to get mad, okay
I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
No, look, I told you that I didn?t want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway.
God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would?ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself.
And if I can?t trust you then just forget it.
No, no, I don?t want to forget it.
Okay y'know what you have to choose.
All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won?t be partners.
So what?s it gonna be?
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
Thank you.  Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
What is it?

Barry who you almost...?
Barry who I almost.
And Mindy, your maid of...?
Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty.  Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
Well, that?s the best kiss I?ve had with anyone I?ve ever met in a men?s room.
Actually, me too.
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
Oh damn, I hate that.
Yeah, we?re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
Oh, don?t worry about it.
No, really you?re gonna freeze.
No, I?m not.
You?re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
Some day, maybe.
OK, listen I?ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright?
It?s a show, but we?re just dancing, OK?
It?s no big deal.
The important thing to remember ? stay cool.
Got it!
Oh my God it?s just like I dreamed it!
OK, everyone gather up.
?Scuse us
Here?s what?s gonna happen. The music?s gonna start, you?re gonna dance, we?re gonna tape, you don?t look at the camera. Any questions?
Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
Uh, yeah.
Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
Ross! So when is it gonna air?
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's 
Smelly cat, smel-ly cat
Better. Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.
Yeah.
You wanna try it again?
Yeah. From the top?
Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?
Ok.
Mmmm hmmm.
That's too much. Sorry.
Oh my God!
I know! Monica?s gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
Oh my God!
Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I?m still holding this.
Okay Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this.
Right.
Okay?
Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
No. Why?
Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
Morning.
Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up.  Good morning Joey.
Good morning.
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
So I told Carl, ?Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.? But of course this went in one ear and out.....
I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he?s Alan Alda.
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
If I was a superhero who could fly
What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
Who?s singing?
I cannot believe I?m gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Okay, I?m totally cool!
Come in.
Hey Jessica.
Hey Jess.
Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
Hi.
?Sup?
Uh listen, here?s your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?!
Well, that-that-that?s it? You?re gonna, you?re gonna put it on your shelf or anything?
Why?
You stole my moves.
just because you?re not in love with the guy you can?t
Wow, you told your dad the truth.
About an hour ago.
Wanna go see a movie?
Yes!  Bye daddy.
there?s gonna be a wedding!
That?s unacceptable Rachel!
What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?!
There are more important things in a marriage other than love!
constantly thinking about things!
You have to think about the consequences of your decision.
Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions!  What gives you the right to?  Go to hell!  Stupid guy on my phone.
Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight.
I just, it was awful.
I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don?t want to take a break.
Wow. I?m sorry. Eggroll?
Okay, so it doesn?t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?
No!
What is it?! What about Pete?
I don?t know!
Okay, I feel like I?m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
I can?t!!
Okay, I gotta go.
I, but you?re so close! No!
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete?s computer company?
Oh, just go. You?re never gonna get it!
Hi.
Hey!
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Ooh, y?know what, I think it?s time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let?s go to the balcony.
What?!
Umm, the street. Come on, let?s go to the street. Ooh, listen, don?t go onto the balcony until after I get back.
So, did you do it?
I-I think we have too.
Okay. Bye.
Bye.  Are you still out there?
No.
I don?t believe this!
Wow, look at this refrigerator!
It?s gigantic!
I mean I could live in this thing!
I?d be cold, but I?m always cold.
Oh my God, look at these spider burners!
I love spider burners.
Yeah, yeah.
He?s got a, he?s got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can?t do anything about it.
Is there something you can do?
Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
Slides are almost ready.
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!

O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she?s really upset we?re just talking.
Ooh, your brother. Score!
What?s up?
Oh, I?m just over here with Ben. I thought we?d say hi.
Oh, put him on!
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.
Oh, I guess he doesn?t feel like talking right now.
He?s smiling though!
Okay, talk to you later.
Oh God, I really had a good time!
Yeah, me too.  So, I guess this is it.
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Yeah!
I will find a selfless good deed!
'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Sure!
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Chandler!  Is he?
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
Why?! I mean if this guy was
You look cute in bubbles.
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
I've had a very long, hard day.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Okay.
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
All right!
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Hey Joe!
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
Hi!

Look, I?m sorry you guys, I-I just don?t think so.
Whatever.
Fine.
Hey, don?t start judging me!
Huh?
You?re the one who?s in love with her assistant!
Huh?

Phoebe!
Secret

Her ass print is still on your grandmother?s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
Y?know what? I?m gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper , and you?re gonna get a stripper.
Monica! Wait!
What?
Carry on.
Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I?ll take them off.
Okay, now would you say that that?s more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
Yeah.
Then that?s not breaking the law! I?m there!
Hey!  Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
Okay, now let?s decide who has the nicest ass.
And there you go!
Oh, yeahhhhh!!!
Chandler!!
At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Okay.  Oh, no!
What, what?s it, what?s going on?
Yeah, this has happened before.
So you know how to fix it?
Yep. Put more gas in.
Hi Rachel!

So you uh, still wondering?
No, we just went out.
You're smart. I like that.
Oh, candles!  What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God!
Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!

What is going on here?
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
Well honey, I?m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I?want to have dinner with you tonight. That?s all.
Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay?
Okay.
That?s good.
Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you?re gonna say.
Good.
Yeah.
Don?t you people ever knock?

Not to shabby, I got this all off myself?using my wife?s tools.  Oh my God!
How did you get in there?!
You?re messy.
Oh no! You weren?t supposed to see this!
I married Fred Sanford!
No Chandler, you don?t understand! (Chandler starts singing the theme for
No, honey you?re not sick! Look, I don?t love you because you?re organized, I love you in spite of that.
Really? You promise you won?t tell anyone?
Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.
Well?it?s just umm?I?m afraid you might mess it up.
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep
Maybe not!
Y'know?
Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them.
Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't
Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
Oh, just ask him!
Me?!
I
No! Forget it! I am
You're right.
Tell him it's for you.
A
Eww!
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
Huh!
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you.
I'm a little younger than I said.
You're not a senior?
Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
Ok...ay.
What the hell happened?!
I am so-so-so sorry.
I was gonna do it!
Really!
But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, Wow!
It?s been a long time since I had?  327 + 238 dollars!
Joey, we had a deal. That-that?s why you?re here! I?ve got to fire you!
And I gotta pay rent!
Look, how-how about this?
You don?t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they?ll start listening to all the nice things I?ve been saying about you.
What kinda things have you been saying?
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
Morning. You wanted to see me?
Please, come in. Have a seat.
Okay look Mr. Zelner
Oh I think it?s best that I speak first.
Yeah.
I?ve asked Lee from human resources to be here as a witness to our conversation.
Oh God.
If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your baby?I am sorry.
Okay?
Last week when I asked you when your due date was uh, I certainly did not mean that I felt that
So ah, whatcha watching?
Baywatch.
What?s it about?
Lifeguards.
Well, it sounds kinda stupid...  Who?s she?
Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
Wow! Look at them run.
They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
Yeah, I?ll go get one.
No, no, no, don?t get up, I got a cooler right here.
Bing!
Oww!!
Game!
Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger.  Are you all right sweethart?
I'm not all right.
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm?Oh! I can't tell you this.
Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
What's going on?
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don?t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee?Oh no, have I said to much?
Well it's just something to think about.
I know I will.
Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here    at 'Javu' ...will kill you..
Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag    of cats against the wall.
You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is    not gonna overuse itself.
Ok, you have to stop playing now.
Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
Get your garlic-peelers    off me!
Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm    Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. ..    Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever!
Ok, quick    question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's    singing outside?
Ok, ok, how many of you
And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
I didn't do that.
Me neither.
So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
Oh we do, but not just yet.
Really?! Well, when?
Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won?t work out.
Wow.
I know. Then, I?m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you?ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Great!
But then we ditch those two and that?s when we get married.
We?ll have Chandler?s money and Rachel?s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel?s drinking problem.
Oh-oh, what about Ross?
I don?t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.
That is so great! Oh, I...  Oh my God!
Whoa!
Oh my God!!!
Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!
No! No!
No, no?
Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic.
Oh my God, here they come!
Well, we gotta get out of here!
W-w-w-wait! Why?!
Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
Yeah, that was real.
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
What?
See, I?ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I?m only planning on doing this once.
So, uh y?know, maybe this is selfish and I?m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
Ohh great.
Can I, can I help you with something?
Well, I don?t know. Are you a masseur?
Yes I am.
Great!  Dad!  Thank you so much, I?ll be back to pick him up in an hour.
Come on! Why are we here?!
Okay, okay take a guess.
The hot chicks?
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y?know-y?know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up?
My doctoral dissertation!
It?s here!
Yeah, it?s right-it?s right down here!
In the biggest library in the university!
Wow that?s actually pretty cool.
We don?t need any toner.
Oh okay, well I?m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.  Yeah you?re right, this is easy.
Okay, what was wrong with that call?
Oh well, all right?um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
They?re always going to tell you they don?t need toner, but that?s okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.
Oh.
So, I think you?re ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
No.  Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
Hello?
Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
Oh! How's it going?
It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
Barbados.
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
What am I supposed to do?
He's out cold!
In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
Well, just wake him up!
I can't! If he realizes that
Uh!
That's a tough one.
Oh!
Wait a minute, this happened to me before!
Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and...  no wait a minute... it was
Okay.
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing.
We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got
Ooh! Ooh! And I brought
Uh, Rach, it's the
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to?
Yes, hold on.
Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
That
They wanna know if I'm okay.
Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see.
Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee!
And it's not even for me!
So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
Alright, c'mon!  Let's play
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
I'm sorry, who's this?
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
No, there's no dog here?
Yes there is!
He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monica?s apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.

Still thinking about it huh?
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?  Especially you!
Oh, who cares?

Y?know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
Okay. Sure.

Oh, somewhere Joey?s head is exploding.
Yeah?but come on?Listen, I?m sorry I don?t want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn?t believe me.
I?m sorry Ray-ray.
I mean if I thought it happened I would say it.
Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
No!!
Rachel, it?s okay.
You don?t have to do this.
I believe you.
All right?
Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.

Nice!
Um-mmm,
That?s great, but isn?t it gonna bother that people still think you?re a porn star?
Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
You do?
Yeah.
You?re trying to figure out where you know me from?
All right, I?ll give you a hint.
From porn!

Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment.
That?s all it was.
Joey, I?m-I?m sorry you feel bad, but haven?t you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
Nooo.

Hi, Lauren.
Hi, Lauren.
Hi, pig!
Hey, big...
Shhhh!
No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty.
Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
Rachel, that's all we do.
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
What about Julie?
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you.
I mean, who is Julie?
I mean, what do you like, what don't you like?
We wanna hear everything.
Well, that could take a while.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
I got the time to get to know Julie.
I got time.
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go?  That's fine.
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
Well, in a nutshell. . .
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Ross!
Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought    the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant?
.
Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious    comma garlicky?
Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention    never hurt anyone?
Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was    fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking?
.
Excuse us!
Alright here's a question: Who was    so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her    friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now?
Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against    her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry too...
ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...
Who's hoping the hand raising thing    is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
Hey! Hey!  Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
Oh, is there a problem?
No.
No.
Every thing's--they're fine.
Great pizza.
But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross.
He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Oh my God! That was flirting?!
Yeah.
Wow!
I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
The guy with the gas?!
Yeah.
I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart.
And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
Really?!
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
I just, I thought Joey was there.
Oh well, lost again.  That's it! You and me, outside!
I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!
Be cool!  Okay lady, your lurking days are over!
What?!
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first!
You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time!
And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home.
When do you leave?
Also Monday.
What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
Come in! Come in!  We?re engaged!!!

Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn?t here!
Oh
Oh hell, he?s done this three times! He knows what its about!
Yeah!
I?m telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
That?s not true! Her, she doesn?t even know what she wants! Rachel?s still mad about the whole thing.
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right?

What?
Umm, you?ve got some on your pants.
I?ll just throw them out.
So? I mean have you thought about it?
Okay. Here?s the thing.
Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What?s the thing?
I can?t do it. I?m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
Wait, wait, wait, wait, that?s-that?s what you?re worried about? If that?s the problem, we?ve got no problem.
Huh?
No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.
Oh?
Her name?s Ann, she?s a journalist.
Ahh, we met on the plane.
She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh.
Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
Oh, that?s great! I mean I?m-I?m sorry, but I?m so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
I guess you can.
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh!  All right, y'know what? I?m just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
All right.
Okay.  Can you give me a little push?
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
Two hundred.
Thank you!
That?s it. I?m done. I don?t care when the baby comes, no more betting.
Okay.
Hello?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  I guess we can bet one more time.
Is Rachel having the baby?
How did you know that?!  Joey! Chandler!! It?s time!
They?re at the coffeehouse.
You know everything!!
Oh wait, double or nothing.
I bet you the baby is over seven pounds.
I bet you it has hair.
I bet you it?s a girl.
We know it?s a girl!
I?ll give you really good odds.
Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
Oh, it's like a skit.
Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
Whoo!
Cool.
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank you.
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Come on.
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish!  The Blowfish!
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
All right Joey, be nice.
Wait, does he eat chalk?
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Sounds like a date to me.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Don't, I like it dirty.
That's your call.
So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Are they, uh, firm?
They'r alright.
You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?
No really, they're OK.
You gonna slice them up real nice?
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
Aaaahhhhhhh.
I'm outa here. [Monica leaves]
Hey!  It?s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant ?You suck!?
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
What, look back?
Well, you?re not gonna get going are you?
Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Well, no. But...
Well I?m not gonna stop until I?m the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Let me tell you a story.
When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight?
No.
There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad?s garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
You didn?t know that already?
Look, I?m gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
Okay, just get a lot better.  Fast.
Hey Ross!
So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you    really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off?
What is that,    come on, a piece of paper?
It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
Go Charlie!
But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also    broke up with them.
Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average    Joe Phd.
Yeah, maybe.
I do have my whole career in front of me.
I mean,    I can still win a Nobel prize.
Although the last two papers I've written were    widely discredited.
You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind,    and funny...
And sexy.
Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
Actually umm
?Crazy underwear, creepin? up my butt.  Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear??
Hey. I was
Better?
Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G?night.
Ah, Kate?
Yeah?
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
I?m probably gonna need those. Huh?
Hey, listen you ah....
Hmm?
...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
Umm.
Kate?
Yep.
You ready to go?
Yeah.
Very nice. Very nice.
So umm, I?ll see you tomorrow, huh?
Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
Oh great!
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Oh, okay.
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
It?s a trip for two!  Excuse me.  Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
Oh, en chante.
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
That?s me.
Ahh, yes.
Oh well, hello.
This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
You-you have to pay that! It?s not just a guess.
Okay. Okay.
I was actually relieved uh I didn?t win the boat. My wife would?ve killed me.
Ohh
Alright, alright, hey y?know fair is fair,  if you?re right, you?re right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
Hey, now you?re the one who wet his pants.
Hey!
I?ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower.
Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone?s names in them and inside is everyone?s individual birth stone.
Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don?t have a guest list.
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that?s coming? Me. Are you?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! What?s up Mon?
Well uh, I?m trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Have at it.
Okay.  All right, turkey. Eh, that won?t work. Cheese?  That won?t work. Olive loaf?  I hope that won?t work.
Are you makin? him a sandwich?
No it?s umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I?m gonna go guys.
Okay.
I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
We have to get her a present?!
Okay but look! Look at what I got! It?s her address book!  We have a guest list!
Oh my God you?re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.
Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
Hey, you wanna see something?
Sure! What?
Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?
Yeah?
Listen uh, I-I?ve been doing some thinking, and I don?t know whether it?s because we?re here or Rachel?s giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.
Okay.
What-what-what?s that now?!
Okay. I?ve been thinking about it too, and I, I think we?re ready.
What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we?re ready to have a baby now?!
Oh, this is fun.
You?re ready to have a baby? My boy?s all grown up!
But you said you were ready too.
Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
Yes, but haven?t you wanted a kid like forever?
Okay, just back off mister! Whoa.  ?Cause I
What?! Are you crazy?!
That?s it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
I?I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
Ah.
But-but this block is like a whole other world.
Y?know actually it does have a very interesting history.
Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system.
Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street.
Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Smooth.
Excuse me?
Umm, say you?re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
Oh I?d like that.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.
After you.
Oh no-no, after you.   Oh my God!
Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things.
Y'know?
Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
That's pretty much it.
Oops!
But you tell it really well, sweetie.
Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
Okay. I'll miss you.
Isn't he great?
He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
Okaaay.  Any of you guys want anything else?
Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Of course it was a line!
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Guess what?
You got a job?
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
No no no!
I don't care, I don't care!
Game's over!
I'm weak!
I've gotta smoke!
I've gotta have the smoke!
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Yeah, alright.
Bing!
Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun.
Ooh.
Barely got ya that time, get over here.
Come on.
Wham!
Good one.
That was a good one.
Keep at it team.
What is with him?
With him? You?re is favourite, you?re his guy!
We never get smacked.
Well, that?s not true, he-he smacked you once.
Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
I?m telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?
No sir.
There you go.
Hey! My first review is out!
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
All right, look at my on the back page.
Everything? Even the TV?
No! I?m putting that in my room.
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don?t you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
That?s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Five years.
You?ve sentenced him?!
Hey! Don?t do the crime if you can?t do the time.
Joey, the guy?s your best friend.
No,
Oh, who? Me?
Yeah!
Wow! I?m honored! And y?know what I?m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
What?
I?m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
All right. But if you weren?t my best friend.
?Okay.  Okay, daddy we?ll see you tomorrow night.  Okay bye-bye.?
We?
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that?s okay.
Oh shoot, tomorrow?s not so good, I?m supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat.
Sorry.
Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
Wow, it?s like a dirty math problem.
I?m sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
Well, that?s really a different question.
I?m sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
What?!!
Excuse me, there was no time!
Okay, but let?s say there was. How might that go?
Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?
Does anybody need more coffee?
Yeah, I?ll take some.
Hey, there?s a dog out there!
That he wouldn?t pay for my lawyer!
Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he?s actually proud off.
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad?s proud of me! My dad?s proud of me.
Rach?
Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
Okay, I bought a boat.
You bought a boat?
Yeah but it wasn?t for me, it was for a friend.
Boy did
Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could?ve ever happened to you.
I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway!
And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now!
I?m the only daughter dad is proud of!
Okay, well this is, this is what you?re gonna do.
You?re gonna get a job, you?re gonna get an apartment, and then I?ll help you and you can stay with us.
Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
Of course, yeah!
Oh, that?s so great! Okay, I?m really gonna do this! I don?t know how to thank you guys.
Ooh, I like cards.
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
That can be arranged.
Let?s reset.
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
Let?s take it from there.
Are you a little off today? It?s going terribly slowly.
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour.
Okay?
And I?m the minister.
Please!
Please!
Can you pull it together?
Of course! I?m-I?m sorry. I-I?d hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
Thank you. Thank you.
Still rolling, annnnd action!
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Now, that can be arranged!  Slippery little bugger!
Professor Geller?
Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
I know I didn?t do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.
And why exactly would I do that?
Because I?m in love with you.
What?!
Yeah, I?m all?in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?
No!
Well why not? You changed Ned?s grade!
Well that?s different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
No he?s not! He?s totally yanking your chain! He?s done this with three other teachers!
What?
He?s got a girlfriend!
I can?t believe someone would do that for a grade.
I know! It?s awful. I love you.
This is Ross?
Ross of.....
Of Ross and Rachel.
Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.
Oh hey, hey Mark.
Hey, hold on a second.
Okay.
Hi honey!
Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
What?
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go.  Mark, I need you!
Okay, bye-bye.
Ow! Ross!!
Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number.
Hello Rachel.
Get off.
Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
Oh, yeah!
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Absolutely.
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know?
I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know?
I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian.
Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
....Are we still talking about sex?
You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
Maureen Rosilla.
?Cause she doesn?t hate Yanni, is not a real reason.
Hello, Mr. Heckles.
You're doing it again.
We're not doing anything.
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
You don't have birds.
Man, I sure miss Julie.
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing.
You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life.
My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
What?
I got a little drunk...and naked.
Bob here.
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
I'm Monica.
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Okay.
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking.
And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Monica
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Will you marry me?
No, go ahead.
Thanks.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh???.
Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
'Kay!
Oh my God!
Hey!
Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Uhh, well, she's?really good in bed.
Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
What?! Why?!
Well because you didn't give me advice!
No!
You gave me a pickup line!
As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first.
I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!
And her roommate!
What about the closeness?
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Oh! Hi!
Hi!
Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
Oh, hello.  Hello.
Soul mate.
What?
Soul mate.
So, what have you guys been doing?
Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?
I know! What is this, 1985?!
That?s exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn?t that strange.
Yes, when I first met you, you were like, Blah, blah, blah. I was like, shhh!
What is it that I do?
Well it?s just like you?re trying too hard. Always making jokes, y?know, you just?You come off a little needy.
Did you like me when we first met?
Chandler, I?m not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you.
Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I?m not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
I can?t! My circuits are fried! They?re fried I tell you!!
Wow!  Well then I?ll just have to carry you.
That?ll be a neat trick, when you?re,  when you?re dead!
Ross, you don?t have to yell.
There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
What else?
Here you go.
Thank you.
Oh wow!
What are you doing?
Oh, sorry.
What you?don?t hold it like that! You?re lettin? all the good stuff fall out.
Oh whoops.
Careful! You?re wasting good pastrami!  Oh my God! I?m
So uh, have a great time down there.
I will.
Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
Yeah.
It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh?
Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it?s revealing which I?m fine with, no I?m concerned about your health, sun exposure.
Oh, don?t worry I have plenty of sun block, it?s SPF-30.
Well, if what?s in the bottle is actually 30.
I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it?s-it?s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it?s just milk.
Ross, it?s going to be okay.
I?m not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys.
I really like you.
I like how things are going between us.
Really?
Yeah! I?m just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
Okay. Cool.
Oh hey! Here they are!
Call me!
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
Come on, let?s have some fun. Huh?  What do you want to do today?
Nothing. I don?t want to do anything.
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
How hot do I look in this, huh?!
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn?t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
That?s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have
Hey, what?s the horsepower on this thing?
I don?t know, but-but look how shiny!
I can?t believe you bought this.
Really! God Ross, what were you thinking?  I know it?s really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
Oh, well get in line missy.  So, can I have a ride stud?
Hop in.  Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Damnit!
Okay, who?s next?
I can?t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger?s gonna be living in
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it?s time the velvet ropes came down.
They kept your room for a while.
Yeah, your roommate is a soap opera star.
Look, y?know I know my life?s going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who?ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they?re thirty.
Yeah, but you shouldn?t compare yourself to me.
Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
There you go!
I did it!
One mile on a hippity-hop!
That?s it!!
That?s everything I wanted to do before I was thirty.
Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister.
But oh well.
Yay!!
And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
So, tonight?s the night of the big bachelor party?
Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl?s number.
No problem. So who?s the party for?
My husband.
You hired your husband a hooker?
She?s a stripper.
No, she?s a hooker.
Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
When they?re hookers.
It was awful.
To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up.
So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn?t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
Y?know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like
I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
Ooh, I don?t know if we?re there yet.
Well, you certainly own that room.
Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Hi.
Hey!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!!
Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!!
In my apartment!!
I am such a huge fan!
I am such a huge fan!
Well, it?s nice to know that you
That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
Oh that explains all the women?s underwear.
Right there! That's my car!  Hey!!
Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
I can't believe this!
Wait, we still have time to talk and they?re-they're not even in the car yet!  Oh look, there they go, okay.
Yes that was a nice place!
Yeah!
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Yeah!
What are we gonna do?
I don't know. Maybe pizza?
About Ross!
Oh! Oh!
Hello!
Oh yeah!
It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references.
Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet!
Yeah, he's very reliable.
Of course he has this big huge dog!
That uh, barks into the night.
Well, who doesn't love dogs?
Ah, he's a tap dancer!
Yes, some would say that
Ohhhhh!
Hey, will you grab me a cruller?  Sit down! Will you
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it?s getting darker and more painful, that means it?s healing.
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let?s just get that thing?pushed back in.
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don?t want that hanging over my head.
Okay?
Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want!
Yeah, I?m thinking I?ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Hey!
Hey.
Hey!
What?s going on?
Oh Joey?s got a really bad hernia, but that?s nothing a little laser eye surgery won?t fix!
Look, I?m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here (He puts his hand down his pants, like Al Bundy on
Hey! Maybe you?ll die!
Are you thinking about Monica?
Yeah.
Yeah, what's that like?
Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Was I talking to her about gas?
More so than anything else.
I-I-I found it interesting.
I'm sorry.
Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
Ross?
Yeah?
What else do they add smell too?
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Joey's not going.
I didn't finish my five pages.
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored.
Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Come on look guys, don't fight.
And the reason I'm doing this is because
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
How about we settle this right now!  There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
I paid for those tickets!
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
No, I?m leaving to get my hair dyed.
Really?!
I like your natural color.
Come on man, it?s a great part.
Look, check it out.
I?m the lead guy?s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat.
Listen-listen.
?I?m sorry, that seat?s saved.?
That?s the whole part?
Okay, I?ll see you in an hour.
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ?I?m sorry, that seat is taken.?
Oh, excuse me.
No, no, I didn?t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
So, you?d hire me, right?
For what?
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
Yeah, it?s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It?s a very important issue in this month?s
Y?know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and
And in
You have no trouble telling time now right?
No!
Quick! What time is it?!
I don?t know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?!  What are you laughing at
Y?know when I said that because we?re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Yeah?
Yeah that was stupid. Let?s not do that.
Ohh, absolutely.
And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Yeah, definitely!
Okay,  if you?ll excuse me, I-I?m gonna go hang out with some people who don?t know the
Then, I?d steer clear of Phoebe.
Man!
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn?t hang out with?all the guys in my office.
Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?
I wouldn't read too much into it.
Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?
David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going.
I'm not very good at giving advice.
So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...
Seriously, we're gonna do this?
I'm sorry, uh...
I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
Oh, because his penis was too big.  Oh, I'm sorry,
That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!
What?
And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.
Is that a hint?
Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!
Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
Mrs. Geller?
She looks so small.
I know.
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
G'bye, Nana.
Bye, Nana.
Ross!
What is going on?!
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
What?
She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
What's going on?
She may have died.
She
We're looking into it.
I, uh, I'll go see.
This almost never happens!
Now
Hey.
Huh.
Well, you?don?t look good Joe.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes?Hey, what was in that brown jar?
Ohh!
Oh, you don?t have to do that every time.
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy!
I was roommates with him in college.
Uh, funny story?  You?re roommate in college died didn?t he?
A part of him did yes.
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth.  So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Yes, we were just
Hi, I?m sorry I?m late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz?s father get here?
I?m already here.
Oh! Ross is sooo great!
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday.
And I noticed there aren?t any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first?  There
Kinda.
Right. So I guess I shouldn?t put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
Oh-ohh, thank you.
Anyway, I?m guessing you hired somebody.
Well
Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.
But I hired you!
What?
Yeah! You-you got the job! You?re my new assistant!
I am?!
Yeah!
I can?t believe it!
Me either.
Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of
Come on, you know they love you.
As much as they love you?
I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It?s not my fault.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey!
Ugh, I hate this year!
What?s wrong with this year?
Well okay, it?s already February and I?ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
That was me and Ross.
Oh that?s right!
Hey, y?know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Oh that?s a great idea. You?re really good on the phone.
Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had.
Y?know, I probably wouldn?t have to say spank as much.
What?
Oh yeah, like you never called!
Oh, Joey! Sorry!
I can?t believe this Chandler!
Sorry! I-I-I don?t know what to say.
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Oh, well I?m uh
Y?know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Oh wow! Okay man, I?m sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
Well that?s good. Because you didn?t! And I?m incredibly happy for ya!!
That?s mean! You really had me going there!
Oh, we could do this all day.
Yeah, you?re right. Okay look, listen, let?s talk about what a huge star I?m gonna be!
You
You hug me!
All right!
Hey, do we do this too much?
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Yeah.
Where are they?
...spender.
She's still asleep.
So how'd it go?
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great.
So I had to do all this other stuff.
And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
It was amazing!
And not just for her... uh-uh.
For me, too.
It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind.
But all my other senses are heightened, y'know?
It's like...
I was able to appreciate it on another level.
I didn't know you had another level.
I know! Neither did I!
Morning!
Oh right.
Yeah.
Oh God. Oh I can?t believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Noo! Oh God we did?we didn?t, we didn?t uhh
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
God I?m just a horrible person.
Wh-why?
Because I?m married. That?s right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star?s apartment to have an affair! Uck!
That?s ridiculous! I?m not a Star, just a regular famous actor.
Ohh, impressive.
Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.
Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
Okay.  So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
All right, I can't wait!
Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
He
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
That's so sweet.
Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you.
It's fine!
We don't have to move in together.
I just?I want you to be happy
Living with you would make me happy.
Phoebe, you
No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Are you sure?
Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
Oh that's great!
Oh wait, one sec.
One sec.
Hey you!
Behind the glass!
Who are you looking at!
I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms,  which was never!
All right Ross you?re in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I?ll take another question.
Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
It?s okay, I?m ready.
No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you?re ready to answer the question.
This is ridiculous, he?s not gonna hold his breath
Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris?Holy cow, that?s a big word.
Trisc? Seriously look at this thing.
Chandler, how do you say that?
N-no! Okay? We?ve been through this! We?re not gonna get married just because she?s pregnant, okay?
Honestly! Ross, this isn?t just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped. A child should have a family.
Mom, y?know what? I-I can?t deal with this right now. I?m sorry
Just?think about it. If you don?t, I?ll talk more about humping.
Gimmie!
Hi!
Oh hi dear!
Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!
This one?
No.
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
Wait! We need shoes!
Okay. Um, how about these?
That's really a day shoe.
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
No, it really should be burgundy.
Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Oh my God..
Is everything all right, dear?
Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
Joey, you?re such an amazing actor!  How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
So?
I feel really sad that we're not?really there anymore.
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Really?
Yeah!
I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before.
Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible.
And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Did not.
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Okay, I freaked out a little.
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places!
It?s my joke.
It?s my joke.
Bye.
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel? Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody?s stairs!
Ross, it?s not that big a deal! So you?ll been divorced three times, you?ll still have a life, you?ll go on dates
No!
No, I won?t!
I?ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now.
The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
Ross, you?re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is
Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Y?know that?s really fair.
Y?know?
Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60.
Ross, nobody cares about this except you!
This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head!
Here, I?ll show you!
Come here.
What?! Why?
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn?t you date him?
And if you wait right here, I?ll go get Ross.
Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here.
Why did I 'woo-hoo'?
I mean, what was I hoping would happen?
That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
I just wish there was something we could do.
Hello.
Hello, Coma Guy.
GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT!
UP!
UP!
UP!
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Maybe nobody's tried this.
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face.
I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart.
I bet he's a lawyer.
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Oh!
And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
I wish all guys could be like him.
I know.
You don?t understand!
Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her!
Is that taking it slow?!
No, I?m not ready for this!
Okay?
What-what do I tell her?
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you?re not ready.
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Then you distract her with a
Or! You can just, y?know
What the hell are you doing?
What? What the hell am
What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
Oh-ho-ho, you think I don?t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me!  Well what do you know! Broken! That?ll be $400!
Joey, I
You pushed him!
Joey, I did not break this! Okay?
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
Uh-huh.
I still haven?t gotten a check for your half yet.
Do
I?m not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
You broke a little girl?s leg?!!
I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Says here that a muppet got whacked on
Well, I?m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she?ll like?
Maybe a
I?m gonna get back to retraining.
Hi.
Six dollars, please.
Six? I just had it for one night. It?s three.
Eight o?clock is the cut-off and,  aww, it?s 8:02.
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you?re gonna have to help me out here, ?cause I only have three.
I can help with that.
Oh my God. Richard?  Hi!
Hi!
Wow! Your lip went bald.  Hey, thanks.
So, you look great.
Right.
No you do. You... just...
What?
You?ve got panties stuck to your leg.
That?s because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it?s static cling.
Or maybe it?s just that God knew I?d be running into you and saw an opportunity.
It?s good to see you.
It?s good to see you too.
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys.
I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
It's a beautiful thing.
What's this?
Which goes where?
Saltines?
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
What?  Oh my God, there's really money in here.
I know.
Weird Girl, what are you doing?
No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.
Oh, that's fine, no.
Would you like my tin-foil hat?
No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
Please, let me do something.
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Ah Monica, my star student.
Y?know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil.
Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star.
Oh, yum-yum-yum.
Wow! A star!  I know you all hate me and-and I?m sorry, but I don?t care.
Okay Joey, you?re up next.  This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!
I can an A? In-in school?  Hey, I?m a dork.
Joey! I?m so proud of you!
I think you should give him your star.
Excuse me? He doesn?t even know what he?s doing!
We?re all beginners here. Nobody knows what they?re doing.
I do! I?m a professional chef!  Oh relax! It?s not a courtroom drama!
If you?re a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?
Yeah!
I?m-I?m sorry, it?s just that umm? Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro?s, and umm I just got a really bad review
Ha! My point!
Oh, no!
I don't think so!
You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.
He was a lawyer!
You said
Well, she cornered me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Lie!!!
How hard is that?!
The check?s in the mail!
Oh your baby is so cute!
I can?t wait to read your book, Ross!
!
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won?t be so bad.
What do you think, she?s just gonna sit there quietly?
You don?t think she?s gonna want to make a toast?
You don?t think she?s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing
Oh my God, she?s not gonna like the chicken that night either, is she?!
Y?know what? It?s gonna be okay. Y?know what? She?s probably not gonna even want to come.
Really?
No! That was a
So-so you would?ve just lied?
Yes!!
Would it really have been that easy?
Yes!!!
Good, so do it Saturday night because we?re going to dinner with her and Clark.
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in
2 hours, 27 minutes.
Really?!
I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good.
Yes!!
Wow!
Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.
Hey Rach!
Hey.
Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Rach?
Yeah?
You have scratches all over you, what happened?
Well, it's my cat.
What?!
Oh yeah, I got a cat.
I don't want a cat!
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
Yeah.
You guys this cat is
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
All right, y?know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
We don?t know what could make this go away.
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
And no one touches the
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Well at least, I?m going to mute it.
What is it hon?
I-I can?t find anything that I want to eat!
Everything I eat makes me nauseous!
I?m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake?ooh!
Cake!
No.
Aww, honey I?m sorry.
God! Ooh! What is that smell? It?s coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Yeah?
It?s me. It?s Phoebe. Listen there?s something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
Is it the shampoo? It?s guava.
No!
Oh! Wait-wait!  Is it my bologna sandwich?
Yes. Yes. Yes. I can?t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can?t eat meat!
Oh, wait-wait!  Maybe it?s a pickle?!
This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
No! I did!
Well, it?s, it?s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
Of course! It?s her favorite.
So um, Mary-Angela, what?s your second favorite?
More of Grandma?s teramisu.
Would you just please....give me the receipt ?cause this is great. It?s top notch.
That dies with me.
So will I.
Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn?t mean anything.
Just do it.
Will you excuse me I have to um.....
Yeah.
I actually am, yeah.
Y'know life-life?s gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow.
Wanna hear a new song?
Yeah.
We?d love too.
Okay.
?Jingle bitch screwed me over!
Go to hell jingle whore!
Go to hell Go to hell.
Go to hell-hell-hell.? That?s all I have so far.
I think you're my favorite.
Which one do you have?
I don't care.
Hi.  Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know
Yeah, umm, no honey.
Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
So, here you are.
It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish.
Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is.
Oh, I had the most fun with you guys!
I wish I could take you home and see you everyday.
Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt.
I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me.
Okay, so we're cool.
Yeah, we're gonna be great.
Little high fives!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Well, if you're gonna cry.
That?s too hard. Too hard!
All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
Or I?ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
No thank you.
Wait-wait-wait-wait!  Come on! Come on, let?s trade! The timing?s perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do!
Okay, but we can?t leave in the small apartment after we?ve lived here!
Didn?t you ever read
Yes! Didn?t you ever read
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
It?s the Knicks!
Screw the Knicks!
Whoa!
I didn?t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Huh.
No, Frank.
No you can?t quit college! No! You?re in college? Really?
Yeah, refrigerator college.
Yeah.
Yeah, y?know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y?know I figured y?know like I should y?know have like a career?and I love refrigerators!
You can?t give up on your dream.
No, it?s okay. We?re-we?re gonna have three kids! And that?s-that?s a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Soon! I-I just couldn?t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn?t do that to her, she?s my best friend!
Well, Joey?s my best friend.
I?m not your best friend?
You just said? Of course you?re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
All right, all right, at least I?m prepared.
Okay.  Oh yes.
Hey!
Hey-hey!
These aren?t for you! Are you upset?
I am now!
Hey roomie!
Okay, bye!
Rach, there?s something uh, important I have to tell you.
Eight! Easy eight.
Wow! I can?t believe I actually rolled an eight.
That was
Wait a minute. That wasn?t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
That?s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
I wanted it so bad!  Wanna go pack?
Yeah.  We?re doing the right thing, right?
Ohh, of course we are!  We left it up to fate.  If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
Look, maybe I got carried away before.
But there's something you gotta know.
If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
Keep talking.
I mean I was nothing before you.
Call the other girls and ask.
Which wouldn't take long.
But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH?MY?GOD.
Really?
Oh-aw my God!
Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong.
We're too good!
We owe it, to sex!
Well, if we owe it?  Oh my? When is Joey gonna be home?
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him.  Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
Yeah.
All right, let's show them how it's done.
Okay.
Ow!
Y'know that wasn't part of it?
I know!
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
Excuse me?
Oh!  Him.
Oh.  Whew!
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up?s apartment! Y?know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Yeah! You?re saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
Y?know, let?s face it, I?m not a kid anymore!
I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do!
I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that!
Talking about pig sex over lunch, I
I think that?s fair.
Fair?
Please don?t even talk to me about fair!
Fair would?ve been you wanting to marry me back then!
Or fair would?ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now!
Believe me,
It?s okay! Shh! Hey. Hey.  Shhhh.
Nothing.  I don?t kn?Umm. I don?t know. Umm

Y?know, I-I? I have to figure?some st?Y?know, some stuff before I can
Sounds good.
It really was!
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
By me?
Oh, no!
No-no.
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Yeah, big!
Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
Gunther, can I get a coffee  to go?
Monica.
I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
What?!
Well, that's what we do.
Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Really?
I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor.
You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself.
All right?
Y'know what?
If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
Hi!
Hi!
So umm, what's this book about?
You didn't read this one either?!
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
What?
Vogue
No! You should've read it yourself!
Come on Phoebe! Don?t be such a goodie-goodie!
Fine!
Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not.
She's a cyborg.
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
Well, go ahead Rachel.
Uh, thank you Phoebe.
Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
Excuse me, is this your car?
Yeah.
Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
So am I!
Ohh, no.
Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too.
So, all right, keep up the good work.
10-4.
Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
I-I'm with the umm, the 57
Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
Who-who else is in vice up there?
Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
No, I don't know him.
Don?t try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
I-I sure will, take care.
Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from
Oh.
I'm hurt!
I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love.
Hurt!
Hurt!
All right Ross!! I get it!!
Oh, it was so amazing. After the  love making...
Oh my.
Yep.
I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out.
And then I knew she was dreaming ?cause, ?cause her eyes keep going like this.
I?m telling ya, Joanna?s got it all wrong.
Okay?
All I said was, ?This was fun.
Let?s do it again sometime.
I?ll give you a call.?
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you?re going to call her?
That?s what you say at the end of a date.
You can?t just say, ?Nice to meet you, good night??
To her face?
Look it?s the end of the date, I?m standing there, I know all she?s waiting for is for me to say ?I?ll call her? and it?s just y'know, comes out.
I can?t help it, it?s a compulsion.
Come on Rach, when a guy says he?s going to call, it doesn?t mean he?s going to call. Hasn?t it ever happened to you?
Well, they always called.
Hmm, bite me.
so this guy was all  And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide.  It was just so cool!
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
You could get arrested, right now!  All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
Hey.
Hey!  Oh.
Hi, Joe.
Yeah, I didn?t know you guys were going to be here.
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
What?! Why?!
What is going on with you?
Nothing!
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream,  but I don't want to talk about it.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?  I kinda have a dream! I don?t want to talk about it.
Well, it involved Monica.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?!
Oh, that is so cool!
I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.
Anyway we're talking about your dream.
I love you.
Your dream?
Not unless different means the same.
What is that?
I think it?s the dying cat parade.
It sounds like it?s coming from across the street.
Oh my God!
What?
Yeah! Oh yeah, you?ll be fine! It-it?ll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y?know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won?t.
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Well, I?m not gonna lie to you Joey, it?s a possibility.
I don?t know Ross!
I-I tell you what, let?s flip to see who does it, okay?
You-you call it in the air, all right?
Oh, all right.  Tails!  Can you-can you see what it is?
No.
Okay. Well, you be careful.
What?
No!
No Ross!
No-no!
Stop!
I?m not jumping!
Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can?t go if I break my leg.
Well I?m not jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won?t have a father if-if I die!
Well all right so, it looks like we?re even!
So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
No-no-no oh, keep your name, don?t take his name.
He didn?t ask me to marry him.
Ohh.
Well then
He wanted to tell me he?s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
Pete?!
Why?! What is it?
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Well, umm, why don?t you give him a call?
Okay.  Are you sure you wanna hear this?
Oh, I?m sure.
Chip!
Hi, it?s Rachel.
Rachel Green.
Yeah, umm, you left me a message.
Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down.
Monica Geller.
Ohh.
Oh, that?s right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that?s gotta be embarrassing!
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, ?Look how much money we?ve got!? Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations!
You-you could have like little money place settings.
And ah, you could start with a money salad!
I mean it?ll be dry, but people
Would you stop? We?ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don?t even know if he?s gonna propose.
Yes, but this is Pete.
Okay?
He?s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome.
For most guys that?s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
Well if-if that?s what it is, then it?s-it?s crazy.
Monica?s right. We?re talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can?t just rush into this.
Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Oh, so you?re going with the teacher, huh?
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know?
But, it?s just Jason?s so sensitive, y'know?
And in the long run, I think sensitive it?s just better than having just like a really, really, really nice  butt.
Jason!
Definitely Jason!
Okay, wish me luck!
Good luck!
OH MY GOD!!!  Sorry, I was just imagining what it?d be like to catch the money bouquet.
So you talked to your dad, huh.
Yeah.
He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
Wow.
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
So Joey, you okay?
Yeah, I guess.
It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go.
Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or...
I'll end up like my mom.
Hey.
Hey, Pheebs.
How's it going?
Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
Awww.
Yeah, right.
Aaawwwwww!!
What happened?
I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just...
I hate that guy!
so I?ve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
Cheese you say? That?s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
Excuse me?
Cheese, it?s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I?m one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.
Me too! Yeah, Chandler can?t stand it. He won?t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
And you?re still married to him?
You know what I?d love to do?
I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese?Not even bread, just cheese.
No, I want the bread.
Yeah.
Ah, and pastries?  And pate.
Oh, I?m really not high, it?s just I used to be fat.
Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I?ve got a great little villa you can stay at.
Is it made of cheese?
No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn?t that be incredible?!
I?d move in tomorrow!
Oh come on!  Are you listening to this?
I?m so sorry.
What do we do?
I don?t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don?t know how you fight that.
Hey! Terry.
Joey Tribbiani! I?m surprised your big head could fit through our small halls!  I gotta go Joey.
Wait!
Terry!
Wait?Look?Wait I-I? Look, I?m really sorry about before.
I was an idiot thinking I?m too big to audition for you.
You gotta give me another chance.
I can?t help you Joey.
Hi.
Hi.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Listen, you are hearing
Yeah well, maybe she should?ve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
Well, I don?t think
You think he?s emotionally unavailable?
I think he can be.
Well, maybe he wouldn?t be if she didn?t bring the office home every night!
Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year?s Eve 1997.
I
We want the last six years back!!
So do we!! So do we!!  I?m sorry you had to see that.
Hey! Sleeping beauty!
Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
Yeah thats what she said.
So?
So I dont wanna be just anybody.
Wow.
You know what, its, its better this way anyway.
I mean I dont  know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us.
Its just much  easier if were just friends who have a kid.
Really?
Yeah.
And youre Okay with that?
Yes.
I mean, its what we always planned.
And if you have  a plan, you should stick to it.
Thats why they call them plans.
Hello?
Im fine.
Hey, for what its worth, with Rachel I dont think youll ever  be just  anybody.
Hey there you go!
Thanks.
Here's my binoculars.
Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
These are my night vision goggles.
This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park.
And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
Oh, yeah. What's this?
Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?
Um, not even a little bit.
It's about you.
Oh, okay then.
I met Phoebe today.
She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser.
And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.
Good. So what were you thinking?
I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
Really?
No.
Oh.
See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.
Oh, okay.
Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Where?d you get it?
Oh well umm, I make it myself! It?s two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is?y?know what? We
Okay. Uhh, I?m gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now. And, when I come back I?ll clean behind the refrigerator.
I love her.
I?ll be back in a minute.
Okay.
See? I told you.
She stole my jeans!
What?
I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
Don?t you see? It?s the perfect crime!
She must?ve been planning this for years!
I will prove it to you!
Okay?
About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch.
Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
Honey, isn?t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
I guess.
So, shouldn?t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go?snooping around her crotch?
Fine. I?m just glad I didn?t give her my secret ingredient.
Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
Yeah!
