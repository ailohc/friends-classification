surprise	Why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
non-neutral	Oh. Thats so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, Wheres number 27?!
neutral	Y'know what?
neutral	It didnt.
joy	Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what Ive got with Alice.
surprise	Now, wh-what, what is that like?
joy	Its so cool man, its so, its just cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
neutral	Yeah, yeah.
non-neutral	Why cant I find that?
anger	Dont ask me, I had it and I blew it!
non-neutral	Well, I want it!
non-neutral	You can have it!
non-neutral	I dont know, maybe I cant. I mean, maybe theres something wrong with me.
non-neutral	Oh, no! No!
joy	Its out there man! Ive seen it! I got it!!
non-neutral	Then you hold on to it!!
joy	All right, man!!
joy	All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
neutral	Come on, Lydia, you can do it.

joy	Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder.
joy	Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out!
joy	Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho.
joy	Let's  I was justyeah, right.
joy	Push!
joy	Push!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
non-neutral	Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
surprise	Okay, go left. Left! Left!
anger	Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
non-neutral	Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!
non-neutral	Straight up over your head!
joy	You can do it!

non-neutral	Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
disgust	Ugh, can you believe that guy!
neutral	Yeah. I really like his glasses.
surprise	Ohh!
neutral	What?
surprise	It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
surprise	Oh my God!
neutral	Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
fear	Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
disgust	Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!
non-neutral	Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I dont have time!
neutral	Theyre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
non-neutral	Youre coming on to the entire room!  Im Chandler.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	Hi.
neutral	You mind if I
neutral	No, please.
neutral	So uh, what are you in for?
neutral	I talk in my sleep.
neutral	What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
neutral	So why dont you give me your number?
neutral	Previously on Friends.
neutral	I dont know exactly. Its-its sorta like wrestling.
surprise	Oh?!
neutral	Yeah, but without the costumes.
neutral	Oh.
neutral	And its not fake, its totally brutal.
neutral	Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Theyre
surprise	So you can like, bite, and pull peoples hair and stuff?
neutral	Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
surprise	Whats fish hooking?
neutral	Huh, whats fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
non-neutral	What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
non-neutral	Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
joy	Well, that makes me feel so good.
neutral	It was just so awkward and bumpy.
surprise	Bumpy?
neutral	Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.
neutral	And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
non-neutral	Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
non-neutral	Coming through!  Oh! Coming through!  Oh! Hello! Hi!  No! Right! Coming through!
neutral	Oh well, its not so bad.
sadness	Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
surprise	Oh!
surprise	My God!
neutral	Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
surprise	Excuse me?
non-neutral	Joey! Hes working!  You would look
non-neutral	Oh, how bad is it?
sadness	Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that isnt burned is an ass. Which I do
neutral	Hows your room Rach?
sadness	Everythings ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
neutral	Isnt that mine?
non-neutral	Fine! Im sorry for your loss!
neutral	So uh, youre not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
non-neutral	Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am
neutral	Yes, they can stay with us.
neutral	Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
non-neutral	Theres just so much pressure.
neutral	I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.
neutral	I dont know if youd understand.
neutral	Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
non-neutral	Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!
neutral	Well, yknow.
fear	I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time.
neutral	So Im gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on.
neutral	Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Okay.
non-neutral	Whats all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
neutral	Ross, we can handle this.
sadness	Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.
anger	I mean, enough of the silliness!
anger	Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!
non-neutral	Okay-okay!
non-neutral	Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together.
non-neutral	Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?
non-neutral	That is so silly.
neutral	Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
neutral	Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
joy	Love is the best medicine.
non-neutral	Thats laughter.
neutral	Why do you do it?
neutral	I dont know.
neutral	Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
neutral	Yeah, I do.
neutral	And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, dont ya?
neutral	Yes.
joy	Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
neutral	Oh.
neutral	But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
neutral	Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
surprise	You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
neutral	Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.
non-neutral	Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!
non-neutral	Define me!
non-neutral	Love me, I need love!
neutral	'.
surprise	Have you really done this before?
joy	Yeah!
joy	Yeah!
joy	Yeah!
neutral	You just take a big, big swing.
neutral	Now, dont hold back.
neutral	and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
joy	Hey!
joy	Hey-hey-hey!
neutral	What are you doing?
joy	Were just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
neutral	Oh, all right.
joy	Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
non-neutral	Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
joy	Okay!
neutral	All right.
neutral	Bye!
neutral	Bye!
non-neutral	Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
neutral	Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey.
neutral	Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
neutral	Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
surprise	Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one!
neutral	Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials?
non-neutral	Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down?
neutral	Because we can remember them.
non-neutral	Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
neutral	Hey. When you guys were kids and you played
neutral	I was always Joanne.
neutral	Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! the war cry of your neighbourhood?
disgust	Ewww! Oh! Its the Mattress King!
non-neutral	Booo!!
disgust	Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
joy	Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
anger	What a wank!
anger	Oh, I cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses.
non-neutral	I know!
non-neutral	And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.
non-neutral	And Im appalled for you by the way.
non-neutral	You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it alone.
disgust	Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my food.
anger	Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
disgust	Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
neutral	Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
fear	Im, Im freaking out!
fear	Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have!
neutral	All right, I havent lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.
neutral	Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
neutral	Um. yeah.
neutral	I am
neutral	All right, look, heres the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.
neutral	So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
non-neutral	Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work.
neutral	Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but thats why you have got to be the bigger man here.
non-neutral	Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me!
non-neutral	Like me tiny doctor!
non-neutral	Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
non-neutral	Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along.
anger	Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.
non-neutral	Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna have to have a separate room for you too!
anger	!
neutral	Okay, okay, okay.  Ill get the bagels.
neutral	Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
neutral	All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
neutral	Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
surprise	Really? A purse?
non-neutral	It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
neutral	It looks like a women's purse.
neutral	No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,
neutral	See look,
neutral	Exactly! Unisex!
neutral	Maybe you need sex.
non-neutral	No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
neutral	Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
neutral	So, um, have you told your parents?
neutral	No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
neutral	Here you go.
neutral	You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.
neutral	.
neutral	.
non-neutral	no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.
joy	I love you Phoebe.
surprise	So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
joy	Hey!
neutral	Hi.
neutral	I just came over to drop offnothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
non-neutral	Yeah, it did.
sadness	So, I guess this is over.
neutral	What?
sadness	Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
non-neutral	Why, exactly?
sadness	Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
surprise	Chandler that's crazy!
anger	If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!
neutral	So, this isn't over?
joy	You are so cute!
non-neutral	No.
neutral	No, it was a fight.
non-neutral	You deal with it and move on!
neutral	It's nothing to freak out about.
joy	Really? Okay. Great!

neutral	Can I tell you a little secret?
joy	Yeah!
neutral	I want to keep one.
joy	Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
neutral	Oh, please.

sadness	Oh God, Im so sorry.

non-neutral	Ow!!
surprise	Oh God!
non-neutral	Hey, you guys! Guess what?
neutral	Got a job on a river boat?
non-neutral	Y'know what I didnt wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? Youre not my girlfriend anymore so...
neutral	Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
neutral	Right.
non-neutral	Now that youre on youre own, youre free to look as stupid as you like.
neutral	You like it right?
neutral	Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! Im kidding!
neutral	Yeah, come here!
neutral	What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
neutral	Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
anger	Okay, good bye!

neutral	Its kind of embarrassing.
non-neutral	Lets just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
neutral	How about you?
sadness	Car accident.

non-neutral	Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasnt paying attention?

surprise	Oh my god.
surprise	What?
surprise	There's something new in the bowl.
non-neutral	Look, we have enough, just walk away.
joy	No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
neutral	There's a forest right outside.

non-neutral	Oh my god, I am losing my mind.
non-neutral	Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from  having sex with Ross!
neutral	Well, youre not.
disgust	Oh, its so easy for you I mean, youre not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
joy	Yeah I can!  And dont think I dont, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!

disgust	Say it louder, I dont think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
anger	Its not like, I havent any opportunities.
neutral	I mean, yknow, Im just waiting for the perfect guy.

anger	So, I hear, you hate me!
neutral	I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
non-neutral	A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
non-neutral	And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
anger	All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.
neutral	So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.
non-neutral	But what does that gonna do...
non-neutral	For Chandler!
joy	Guess what, I got an audition!
joy	Awww, one of my students got an audition. Im so proud.

neutral	I thought he was with you.
neutral	He-he was with me umm, were playing a little game, yknow? Hide and seek.
neutral	You cant ask us son, thats cheating.
neutral	Youre right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
neutral	Well, he better not come by here. He cant see the bride in the wedding dress.
non-neutral	As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
neutral	But that was after the wedding, its not bad luck then.
neutral	Honey, it isnt good luck.
surprise	Oh my God! Monica!
neutral	I know! Hey, hows Chandler doin?
neutral	Great. Hes doing great. Dont you worry about Chandler.
neutral	Are you okay?
neutral	Uh-huh.

neutral	So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
non-neutral	Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
non-neutral	I cant believe it! He still hasnt called.

non-neutral	Oh, come on! I dont care! Come on! Whose is it?
neutral	Diane Keaton.

neutral	Its not for me, its for Rachel.
neutral	But Rachel has an apartment.
neutral	Yeah, but when the baby comes shes gonna want to move.
surprise	She is?
surprise	Yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you?
neutral	I guess I didnt really think about it.
non-neutral	Ezel!  Hey Gunther! Youre an ezel!
anger	Damnit!
surprise	Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people?

joy	Oh, that is so sweet!
joy	I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
neutral	Huh. Except, Phoebes not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
sadness	Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies.
sadness	Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
surprise	Wait a minute!
joy	Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after shes done being pregnant.
neutral	Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
joy	Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants shes always wanted!
joy	Oh, shes gonna love that!
neutral	Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
neutral	Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
neutral	So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
anger	Fine, Im mentally unstable.
neutral	And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Uh yes, heroin and crack.
anger	Crack isnt even an intravenous drug!
neutral	Well, you would know.
neutral	Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
non-neutral	Oh, come on!
non-neutral	Ross, please, I found the magazines!
non-neutral	No!
neutral	Phoebe just because I'm alone doesnt mean I wanna walk around naked.
neutral	I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
non-neutral	Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
sadness	I know, I lied! I didnt want her to think I was a terrible mother! I cant even see my own baby!
neutral	Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  its-its-its, its right there .

non-neutral	Will you stop!
neutral	Okay. All right.
joy	Okay, all right, I think youre great, I think youre sweet, and youre smart, and I love you.
disgust	But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
joy	Hey!

joy	Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
joy	Hey, check me out, Im a slut!

non-neutral	Oh yeah! Yeah! Dont worry about me, Ill be fine!
neutral	You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
neutral	Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
non-neutral	Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
non-neutral	Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby?
neutral	Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
non-neutral	oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks.
surprise	I can't believe    I didn't even think of that.
non-neutral	I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...
non-neutral	What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?
non-neutral	It was a "Wendy's!!    "
surprise	...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
disgust	Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else?
surprise	Like you, I dont even know where you work?
neutral	Yeah.
non-neutral	Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a

non-neutral	Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
non-neutral	Yeah!
neutral	Well, Im not going to go now anyway .
neutral	Okay .
neutral	Here you go.
neutral	Ah, Gunther, I cant pay for this right now because Im not working, so Ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin for stuff.
neutral	Well, if you want, you can work here.
neutral	Uh, I dont know.
neutral	Ya see, its just, see I was a regular on a soap opera yknow?
sadness	And to go from that to this, I just Plus, Id have to wait on all my friends.
neutral	Okay, but the moneys good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Flexible hours.
neutral	Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
neutral	I have no name.
neutral	All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
neutral	Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
disgust	No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
surprise	Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
neutral	Umm, Gene.
anger	Its Clint. Its Clint!
neutral	See you later, Gene.

non-neutral	Ohh, I know one thing!
non-neutral	What?
non-neutral	They did it right there on the couch.
non-neutral	Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in.
non-neutral	I mean, that guy with the toe thing?
neutral	Who's he sleeping with?
neutral	Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...
neutral	I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.
non-neutral	Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-!
neutral	So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.
neutral	So where did you study?
neutral	Oh, I didn't go to college.
neutral	No, where did you study acting?
neutral	Molly ... people don't study acting ...
neutral	Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?

sadness	Will the stable boy never get the princess??
disgust	What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here    on my couch?
non-neutral	No ... the leather sticks to my ass.
anger	You know, this isn't fair.
anger	What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?
non-neutral	Huh?
anger	Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?
non-neutral	Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?
sadness	I didn't think I could ever love again.
non-neutral	Come on! Joe!
neutral	Ok
neutral	Hi, is Molly here?
neutral	Yeah, come on in. Molly?

neutral	Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
neutral	Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
non-neutral	Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
neutral	Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
non-neutral	You betcha!
surprise	Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
neutral	When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.

neutral	All right! Ill try! But if I cant, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
anger	Go!!
neutral	All right, all right, all right.
neutral	I mean Ill have to check with him first, but Ill think hell be cool with it.
non-neutral	So, hes just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesnt want anything in exchange for helping him?
neutral	Well, I assume Ill have to take showers with him, but y'know, thats true of any job.
neutral	How ya feelin?
neutral	Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it.
neutral	Whered you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.

anger	You see what men do! Dont tell me men are not nice!  This is men!!
non-neutral	Whats wrong with you?
anger	Nothing!
sadness	Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.

anger	No way!
non-neutral	Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
disgust	Why did I have to start working out again?
anger	Damn you 15s!
neutral	Its a trifle.
neutral	Its got all of these layers.
neutral	First theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.
non-neutral	[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like somethings wrong.]
neutral	then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
disgust	It tastes like feet!
joy	I like it.

non-neutral	She is not  Shes gay. Oh my God. She is
surprise	Good day for married people huh?
sadness	Im sorry your husband cheated on you.
non-neutral	Im sorry your wife is gay. I guess women arent that great either.
non-neutral	Try telling my wife that.

non-neutral	Yeah, but they didn't ask me!
non-neutral	Y'know?
joy	This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger.
joy	That's always fun to be.
anger	Yeah, but you're making me look bad!

surprise	She really said that?
neutral	Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...
neutral	But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
surprise	'Tonight' tonight?
joy	Well, I think it's perfect.
neutral	Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
non-neutral	I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
joy	Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
disgust	Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
neutral	Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
neutral	No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
joy	Alright, well, be good, I love you.
anger	You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
sadness	O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
anger	Really stupid.
non-neutral	Really stupid.
non-neutral	And I don't even know how it happened.
sadness	I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.
fear	Are we okay now?
anger	Yeah. No. No...
neutral	Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
neutral	Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
surprise	You're kidding.
neutral	No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
neutral	Oh there it is.
neutral	Thats not your regular dry cleaners.
disgust	I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one.
disgust	I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store
surprise	What?!
neutral	A new grocery store.
non-neutral	The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and thats what they gave me?
anger	When I get up there Im going to kick some ass.
neutral	Dont worry Phoebe, youre gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
neutral	Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
neutral	Oh, you didnt have to come in with me.
non-neutral	Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like
neutral	Okay.
surprise	Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s Wow!
surprise	What?
surprise	Im sorry, its just that youre so incredibly beautiful.
neutral	Oh yeah well, Im sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?
non-neutral	I hope you dont think Im crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
neutral	A little.   Now youre talking.
neutral	Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
joy	I-I-Id love to. Let me just tell my friend.
joy	Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
neutral	She mustve left.
anger	Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
surprise	Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
joy	That's right baby.

non-neutral	No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
surprise	What?
non-neutral	He's a dropper!
non-neutral	Oh yeah, that's right!
anger	I'm not a dropper!

non-neutral	It's throwing and catching!
neutral	All right.
surprise	Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
non-neutral	Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
surprise	Oh myOh good God!
non-neutral	I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
neutral	Baking it didn't help, huh?
neutral	All right, well the place was closed. Ill just copy it later.
non-neutral	Or not. Uh, Rach, why dont you just move in with me?
surprise	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
neutral	No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no Its okay, I mean Ilook Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursdays thing, but we dont have to do that!
neutral	Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless youre thinking about Naked Wednesdays.
joy	Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
joy	So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
neutral	Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
non-neutral	Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
disgust	Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
neutral	I was shrieking... like a Marine.
neutral	All right here. Watch me execute the three Ps of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.
neutral	She's not much of a phone person.
neutral	Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
non-neutral	Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
neutral	Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
non-neutral	Maybe you should.
non-neutral	Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
neutral	You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
neutral	Oh, that is so not true.
neutral	Oh, it is.
neutral	It isn't.
neutral	It is.
anger	Isn't!
neutral	Okay ladies, that ends todays class, and lets remember, lets be safe out there.
joy	Its a great class.
neutral	Thanks.
neutral	Yeah, yeah, I was watching.
neutral	Umm, hey, a couple of questions though.
non-neutral	Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
neutral	Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them
non-neutral	No. No-no. No. What would
surprise	Who? Me the attacker?
sadness	Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you.
sadness	Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
surprise	No-noReally?!
non-neutral	Of course!
sadness	Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh
sadness	Ohh, Im sorry.
neutral	Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
non-neutral	What?! Anything! Anything!
neutral	Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.
non-neutral	This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
surprise	Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
neutral	Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later.
neutral	Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over here. All right, come on
non-neutral	Hey, you guys. Listen, Im sorry that I was hogging the game beforeOh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
neutral	Theyre all Chandler.
surprise	Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good!
neutral	I did.  But it came at a price.
fear	But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.
surprise	Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!
joy	Sure!
neutral	Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?
joy	With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!
joy	And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!
neutral	Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much.
joy	Well, I like that idea.
joy	Obviously!
neutral	I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow?
neutral	I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like
disgust	No.
non-neutral	Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely."
disgust	Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
surprise	So, thats it?
neutral	I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
neutral	Which is why
anger	What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
non-neutral	I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
non-neutral	Are you mocking me?
neutral	No, Im not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.
joy	Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
joy	Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
neutral	Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but
neutral	Cat.
joy	Yes! You are so smart!  I love you.
joy	I love you too.
non-neutral	I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!

neutral	Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has
neutral	But
disgust	No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
neutral	Okay. Okay, but you cant fire him today.
non-neutral	Why not?!
non-neutral	Because Im dumping him today.
surprise	What?! You said he was sweet!
neutral	He
neutral	Just dont pick up your phone.
disgust	Then he comes over!  "Im so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
surprise	What? So now Im not allowed to fire him?
non-neutral	You cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill himself.
neutral	Okay well then, Ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
disgust	Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill
neutral	Okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it!
non-neutral	Okay. But the question is whos gonna go first. Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
non-neutral	Really? Thats the thing Im worse at! Youll see.
neutral	This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
sadness	Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
sadness	Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone?
neutral	Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.

joy	Well, I then guess Im going to Yemen! Im going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
joy	Hi!
neutral	Hey.
neutral	HeyOoh, hows Hilda? Is she working out?
neutral	Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
neutral	Was she happy you gave her the job?
neutral	Oh, my-my new assistant was very happy that I hired my new assistant.
neutral	Hello?
surprise	Oh hey!
neutral	Can you, can you hang on a second?
neutral	Its the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
neutral	can you excuse me for a minute?
non-neutral	Hey, funny you should call.

joy	I know. I like it up here.
non-neutral	I feel like were the only two people in the world.  Oops. Sorry.
non-neutral	Whats the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
fear	No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-Iwould youactually, would you go check on that?

neutral	Ohh,
neutral	Perhaps. Now Im curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to
neutral	All right, so we werent
neutral	Im sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but Ilook, I just want you guys to be safe.
neutral	What are you doing?
neutral	Im leaning. This is where I lean.
neutral	Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
fear	Brenda a bee!
surprise	What?
non-neutral	Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
disgust	I think I know whats going on here.
neutral	You do?
disgust	Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its wrong. Youre married.
neutral	I totally understand.  Can I
joy	All right, let's do it!
surprise	No, no, no. What was that?
neutral	I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
non-neutral	Well, people!
neutral	People, people, people.
neutral	Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey.
neutral	Show 'em how it's done.
neutral	Count it off.
neutral	So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
disgust	Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and hes so cheap, hed never fly to London in a million years.
neutral	Yeah, invite him?
neutral	Hey, did I do these neat enough?
neutral	Yeah, theyre fine.
non-neutral	Yeah?
surprise	If anyone asks, well just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
neutral	Sure. Why not?
surprise	Really?
neutral	Yeah?
non-neutral	I dont think Id be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
fear	Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldnt invite her?
non-neutral	Oh, no-no, yknow I absolutely adore Rachel its just that, well it might be a awkward for you.
neutral	But its absolutely your decision.
neutral	More tea?
neutral	Yeah sure.
neutral	Earl Grey?
non-neutral	Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.

non-neutral	Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
neutral	Excuse me?
neutral	Could you help me with something?
neutral	The patient Im looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.
neutral	And umm, hes like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
neutral	I think I know who youre talking about.

surprise	Oh my God.
neutral	I know.
neutral	Okay, I gotta go.
surprise	Whoa! What?! Why?!
sadness	Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
surprise	Here?! Now?!
neutral	Well, yeah.
fear	I cant-I cant stay here all night, and if I go in there shes-shes gonna wanna... do stuff.
surprise	What happened?
sadness	Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago.
joy	Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!

surprise	Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
surprise	What?! Tonight?!
neutral	Thats what Monica said.
surprise	After she gave me that big speech?!
anger	She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?
anger	I think shes trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
neutral	Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
disgust	Who cares? I repel women.
surprise	No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Its yours!
non-neutral	Yeah well, Im-Im a slut.

non-neutral	That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
sadness	I'm sorry, man.

neutral	You should make something happen for yourself.
neutral	Y'know, like-like write a play.
joy	Write a movie!
neutral	Huh?
neutral	I mean, what about those
sadness	Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
joy	Wait a second, I could star in it!
neutral	Or that.
non-neutral	I can't write!
sadness	Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?
sadness	I can't do it.

neutral	And plus, it'll give me something to do.
neutral	Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
neutral	Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope thats cool.
neutral	Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
neutral	Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.
neutral	Although, I should probably tell you, shes a porn star.
neutral	Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good.
neutral	All right.
non-neutral	As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
neutral	Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt have to apologize.
neutral	I would really love it if I could do both.
non-neutral	All right, II have to ask.
neutral	What?
fear	Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
surprise	What?!
anger	Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
disgust	A hundred and forty-five pounds.
non-neutral	Yes, yes it is. Its uh  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
non-neutral	Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me?
anger	Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didnt bring you here so you can ambush her.
neutral	Frannie was the one who found your
anger	That bitch!
surprise	Monica! What
anger	Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
neutral	Hi Frannie, congratulations.
anger	You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!
surprise	Why?!
non-neutral	WhatWhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding?
non-neutral	What could I have possibly done?!
anger	Stuart!
neutral	I believe you know my husband.
neutral	So its really a question of
non-neutral	Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
surprise	Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
neutral	Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
surprise	Yeah?
neutral	It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
neutral	What's up?
neutral	Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk.
neutral	Man to uh, me.
neutral	Sure. Okay.
surprise	Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
neutral	Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
neutral	You mean scared.
neutral	No, I mean happy.
joy	Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
sadness	Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in.
surprise	What do you mean, theyre not moving in? They-theyre still moving in right?
neutral	No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
surprise	What?! Over a stupid room!
joy	Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but Im also really psyched cause I dont have to move in here!
joy	Oh no, yeah no, that parts great!
neutral	Yes

neutral	What, wait, you mean like this?
surprise	Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
neutral	Your not doing it.
neutral	Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I cant. We dont have that....
neutral	Where there is no fear of commitment.
neutral	Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
neutral	Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.
neutral	But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.
fear	It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!
neutral	If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.
neutral	Right.
neutral	In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
non-neutral	Amazingly, that makes sense.
neutral	You think?
joy	Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
fear	Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.

neutral	Uh sure, sure.
neutral	Bye guys.
non-neutral	I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
non-neutral	You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve got a girlfriend?
neutral	Is this about Mark?
surprise	Oh my God.
neutral	Okay, its not, its not.
non-neutral	Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.

non-neutral	Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
neutral	Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.
non-neutral	Oh? Why not?

non-neutral	Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
non-neutral	Well now-now youre just talking crazy.
neutral	So why cant the three of us go out together?
sadness	Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
non-neutral	Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.
joy	And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
anger	Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
neutral	Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this.
joy	Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club.
anger	Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.
neutral	Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.
neutral	It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.
anger	: Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!
neutral	It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
neutral	What are you doing?
neutral	Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy.
neutral	Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.
neutral	There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.
neutral	Did he call?
sadness	No. Sorry.
non-neutral	Why?! Why?! He said hed call. Why hasnt he called?
neutral	Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
non-neutral	Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasnt he called, Rachel? Why?
neutral	Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
surprise	Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
neutral	Well...
non-neutral	The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you?
neutral	No. I...
anger	Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
non-neutral	And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?
non-neutral	I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion!
anger	Is that too much to ask after six years?!
non-neutral	I mean what?
non-neutral	Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!
non-neutral	I mean do we not have as much fun?!
non-neutral	Dont I deserve a few tears?!!
non-neutral	I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
non-neutral	Hey!
anger	I did not cry my eyes out!!
non-neutral	Come on!
sadness	Its like the end of an era!
sadness	No more J-man and Channies!
non-neutral	!
non-neutral	Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
neutral	Do I know why were rushing?
neutral	Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
neutral	Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.
joy	Oh, I found it!
surprise	!
joy	Thats so great for you guys!
joy	Yeah!
neutral	Good luck, with your girlfriend.
joy	Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!
neutral	Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
neutral	Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
neutral	So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
joy	Yes, you can, very much.
surprise	Ahhhh!!
non-neutral	Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
neutral	Do
neutral	Ah,
neutral	Do
neutral	Ah,
non-neutral	DO YOU?
non-neutral	Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was a beautiful speech.
disgust	Oh, come on.
non-neutral	Hey!
joy	All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!
neutral	And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.
neutral	And what you said about Nana.
non-neutral	Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there.
neutral	And you know what?
neutral	I think she was.
surprise	Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
neutral	You forget how many great songs Heart had.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
non-neutral	So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
neutral	Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but Im not even sure I got it.
neutral	What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey.
neutral	And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.
non-neutral	You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
neutral	Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
anger	I cant find garbage bags!
neutral	Oh, I think I saw some in here.
surprise	What is it?!
disgust	I dont know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itll die.
non-neutral	I cant believe were living here!
surprise	You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really  proposing?
non-neutral	No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.
surprise	Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it  look like?!
non-neutral	I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of  it.
non-neutral	Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
sadness	Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don't want to hurt her.
neutral	Okay, look, just do it gently.
neutral	You're right.
neutral	You're right.
neutral	I-I'll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I'll be gentle.
neutral	I can do that.
neutral	I am a gentle person.
neutral	Oh, by the  way.
neutral	Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.
neutral	Hi, Pheebs?
neutral	Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
non-neutral	What?!
non-neutral	Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England.
neutral	Which
neutral	How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
neutral	Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
neutral	Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
joy	Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which
joy	Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here
anger	You completely stole my answer!
non-neutral	Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
anger	Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
neutral	What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
neutral	I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
neutral	Would ya care to venture one?
neutral	Would
anger	Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
neutral	Are you just repeating what
neutral	All right, let's move on.
neutral	Okay then.
neutral	All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.
neutral	And-and when she comes in hopefully, she wont recognise you because, well, why would she?
neutral	Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.
neutral	You be Mr. Gonzalez, and Ill be uh, Mr. Wong.
neutral	Diverse.
neutral	Did anybody call for security?
neutral	You be cool.
neutral	Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk?  Hey, Joey?
fear	Wheres my ring? My dead grandmothers wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
neutral	Way to be cool, man.
neutral	Whats he talking about?
non-neutral	There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
surprise	Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
anger	We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
surprise	Okay, who are you?
non-neutral	The Hardy boys?
anger	Look, I dont need to steal some stupid ring, all right?
anger	I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
neutral	Marry me.
surprise	Oh my God! Joey!
joy	Hell yeah! Ill marry you!
anger	You cant marry him!
non-neutral	Hey lady, your days over! Its my turn!
surprise	Phoebe!
surprise	Why?! Why cant she marry me?!
non-neutral	I can and I will!
neutral	Shes not pregnant. Its Rachel. Rachels the one whos pregnant.
surprise	Oh my God.
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	Phoebe I think he would notice if you didnt have a baby in nine months!
surprise	Its Joey!
surprise	Now I cant believe it! What? Rachels pregnant?  Whos the father?
neutral	We dont know.
neutral	Ohh I wonder if that dude.
surprise	Theres a dude?
neutral	Yeah.
surprise	Who? Who is it?
disgust	About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didnt see who it was but
neutral	Was that story over?
neutral	The guy left this.
surprise	Oh my God! I know who the father is
non-neutral	People have got to finish their stories!
surprise	Oh my God, youre back!
surprise	Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
neutral	Why do you want to see my hand?
disgust	I wanna see whats in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
neutral	Yeah.
disgust	Eww! Oh, its all dirty. You should throw this out.
anger	No!
non-neutral	Me too!
neutral	Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, yknow?
non-neutral	Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we dont wanna look stupid!
joy	Alright were back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
neutral	Three, Two, One!
neutral	Cut!
joy	No! Year! Happy No Year!
joy	Okay, heres where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone thats a wrap!
neutral	So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
neutral	Oh no-no believe me, Im leaving as soon as possible!
neutral	Good. Good. Not that we dont want you to stay, obviously youre welcomeHow much more homework do you have?
neutral	I see. Yknow umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
surprise	No!
neutral	No, she doesnt.
neutral	Uh Phoebe, what she makesthats uhtheyre sock rabbits.
anger	They are completely differentOkay!
surprise	Okay!

non-neutral	I will!
neutral	I-I am going to
neutral	Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
neutral	No.  And then I called him, and he wasnt there.
neutral	Well, then hes, hes probably just, out.
non-neutral	Oh, thank you thats very helpful, Im glad you came over.
neutral	Hello.
non-neutral	Hi! Its me.
joy	Hi! Oh, Im so glad you called.
non-neutral	Really? Ive been thinking, this is crazy, I mean dont, dont you think we can work on this?

neutral	Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
non-neutral	Yeah! Got it!
non-neutral	Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
non-neutral	Ah, thats okay, thanks.
neutral	Hey, you dont have to smile. You just have to dance.
non-neutral	Look, I dont feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
neutral	Oh, okay.  Hey, two beers.
neutral	You wanna go in the bedroom? Its a little more comfortable.
neutral	Sure.
surprise	Okay.  Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
surprise	If this is your idea of sexy talk?
non-neutral	No seriously, yknow the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
neutral	What contracts?
non-neutral	Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I dont get.
neutral	Like what?
disgust	Yknow, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?
anger	Tag!
anger	Im serious!
anger	This isnt funny!
anger	Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
surprise	Rach, Im sorry, but you didnt give me any contracts!
anger	Yes I did! And I put a little
neutral	Im telling you, you never gave them to me.
anger	Yknow what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
non-neutral	No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are
disgust	Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
neutral	You wanna go down to the office right now?
anger	No! Come on its late, were not gonna go down to the office.

neutral	Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before?
neutral	Oh right, Coach Ruben.
neutral	Do you know what Pheebs?
fear	When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
neutral	Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
neutral	See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
surprise	What do you mean?
anger	Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
anger	Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
surprise	Uh, what was that?

joy	You're so pretty.
joy	Hi!
neutral	Hey, Phoebe.
neutral	Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.

joy	Oh good!
joy	Thank you, I need that.
surprise	Whoa!

neutral	Hes not here right now.
anger	Oh, youre kidding me!
neutral	All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes.
neutral	Okay?
neutral	Im an actor; Im kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
neutral	Yknow, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
neutral	Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  Youre the other one right?
non-neutral	Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
surprise	What?! Youre crazy! Theres nothing sexual about the noises I make!
surprise	Really?
non-neutral	Theres nothing sexual about this?
non-neutral	Oooh.

non-neutral	Oh myThis is so embarrassing. Oh my God, Im never gonna get massaged again!
non-neutral	No, you cant let this stop you from getting massages!
neutral	No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
surprise	Really?!
neutral	Well not clients, lovers. But lets just yknow, try it again. Come back and-and well work through it.
surprise	Are you sure?
neutral	Yes.
neutral	I guess.
joy	Great! Okay, if youll just excuse me.  So, did you hear something you liked?
non-neutral	Noo!!!
non-neutral	Yes!
non-neutral	Noo!!
non-neutral	Yes!!
fear	Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk!  That they know of.
neutral	Okay, heres the thing. Were gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that youre drunk.
non-neutral	Really?! You promise?

neutral	All right, well finish your coffee; lets go.
disgust	Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
neutral	Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight.
non-neutral	I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
sadness	Im sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby
neutral	So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
non-neutral	Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.
neutral	Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
joy	She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
joy	Oh, what a fun office.
neutral	I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.
neutral	So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
neutral	Rachel? Do you smoke?
neutral	Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror storiesabout ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
neutral	What?
neutral	Peach pit.
neutral	Yes, Bunny?
neutral	Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
neutral	-Peaches?
neutral	Actually, nectarines, but basically...
neutral	Could've been a peach.
neutral	Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.
non-neutral	Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!  What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
joy	All right!
joy	Westminster Abbey!
joy	Hands down, best Abbey Ive ever seen.
joy	Hey!
neutral	Okay.
neutral	What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
neutral	I think its great. Its great. Yknow, theyre thinking of changing the name of this place.
surprise	Really? To what?
non-neutral	To Put the Camera Away!!!
neutral	Man,
surprise	Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And
neutral	Chandler, theres a guy right over there.
surprise	Thats a mailman! Thats
neutral	Chandler, dont worry! This doesnt make you any less of a guy!
neutral	Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
neutral	Hmm.
non-neutral	Eh..., I dont, I dont know.
neutral	What?
non-neutral	Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
neutral	Rachel?
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
non-neutral	Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
neutral	Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
non-neutral	Eh, do you believe that?
neutral	Yeah?
non-neutral	Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
neutral	No, you said the baby creeps you out.
non-neutral	No, the little girl creeps me out.
neutral	You said the baby.
non-neutral	Why would the baby creep me out?
non-neutral	Why would the little girl creep you out?
neutral	You guys, Im sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
surprise	This is going in your book?
joy	Yeah, its about relationships. Yknow? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
surprise	What?! Excuse me!
neutral	And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.
neutral	And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as its a compliment.
joy	Yeah!!!!
joy	Yes, I made it!
joy	Im on time!
neutral	Okay, why dont we all uh,  open our books to page 23.
neutral	Where  Where you will seea uha bunch of uhred spots.
neutral	Okay,  umm, why dont, why dont you all start to read, while I
non-neutral	Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
non-neutral	Ross! What are you I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
neutral	Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
surprise	What the? What
non-neutral	Hi!
neutral	Miss? May I help you?
non-neutral	Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay?
neutral	But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.
sadness	So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
neutral	It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
neutral	Do you want me to be afraid of you?
neutral	Of course not.
joy	I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.
non-neutral	I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
surprise	Really?
neutral	Of course!
non-neutral	Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
neutral	All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit
anger	Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is
disgust	A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
non-neutral	Ooh, it's not a toy.
sadness	Well, I don't know what else to do.
non-neutral	I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!
non-neutral	So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!
non-neutral	'Cause I-I got nothing!
non-neutral	All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.
neutral	Okay then.
neutral	Here we go.
non-neutral	Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?
neutral	Ask again later.
anger	Later is not good enough.
neutral	Ask again later.
anger	What the hell!
anger	This is broken!
anger	It-it is broken!
neutral	All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
neutral	Excuse me.
neutral	Yeah?
neutral	Are you Phoebe Buffay?
neutral	Yeah.
joy	Can-can I get your autograph, Im your biggest fan.
neutral	I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
joy	Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
non-neutral	No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
neutral	Come on, two on one.
surprise	What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
surprise	What, now?
joy	Yes, now is when you swoop!
joy	You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not!
non-neutral	You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
neutral	My Catholic friend is right.
neutral	She's distraught.
neutral	You're there for her.
joy	You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
neutral	Well, I just called Joshua
non-neutral	Oh, how did it go?
neutral	Well, I did my best to convince him that Im not some crazy girl who is dying to get marriedIm just going through a hard time.
neutral	What did he say?
non-neutral	Well uh, his answering machine was
non-neutral	Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that hes gonna call you again.
sadness	Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care.
sadness	I dont think hes the one Im sad about.
sadness	Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well.
sadness	Yeah, maybe.
sadness	And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
non-neutral	Any luck?
sadness	Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?
sadness	I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
non-neutral	Again. Yknow what? I think we all did.
non-neutral	Hey!
surprise	I dont get it!
non-neutral	It was in my room all night!
non-neutral	And if she didnt take it, and I didnt take it; and you  didnt take it, then who did?
anger	Shh!
anger	Were trying to think!
neutral	This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
surprise	What?!
joy	Oh yeah!
neutral	I got in there myself once.
neutral	My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldnt, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.
neutral	Yeah.
non-neutral	It was funny til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
neutral	No, you, you cant fit in that thing. Thats not deep enough.
non-neutral	Oh yeah?  If I cant, Ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
neutral	All right, you have yourself a deal.
surprise	Okay.  See?! I told ya!
non-neutral	Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
neutral	Hey! Whats up?
non-neutral	Hey!
joy	Hey-hey, whos your friend?  Hey!!
joy	Hey Joey!
joy	Erin! Still here!
joy	Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
joy	Why wouldnt ya? Erin is great! Then-then theres you guys.
joy	Ohh, listen. Ive got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
non-neutral	I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
neutral	Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just
surprise	Really?!
surprise	Ohh!
neutral	Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
surprise	Really?!
joy	Yeah!
neutral	I mean you definitely should do that.
joy	Y'know what, I should do it.
joy	Yeah!
joy	Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
neutral	Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
neutral	All right.
non-neutral	Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.

neutral	You're not an artist.
non-neutral	Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
surprise	I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
non-neutral	No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.

non-neutral	What is it? Hey!
sadness	Really its nothing. Im just
neutral	Rach come on, what?
sadness	Ive just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
surprise	What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
sadness	Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
neutral	Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
sadness	Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right?

joy	I just found out this is Chandlers office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!
non-neutral	Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
anger	We said seven!
anger	We said six!
neutral	The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.
anger	Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!"
joy	Hi!
disgust	Oh my good God.
disgust	Ugh!
non-neutral	I know what time you said.
surprise	What?!
neutral	Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.

non-neutral	Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-IHey! I did
anger	Thats my wife!!! Get out!
neutral	Well, we should go.
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport.
neutral	Oh please.
non-neutral	Every moment is precious.
neutral	Yknow?
non-neutral	Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.
neutral	Well, were really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
non-neutral	On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane.
non-neutral	No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.
neutral	Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
neutral	Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
neutral	So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.
neutral	We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
joy	Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.
surprise	Yeah?
joy	Yeah!
neutral	Just go for it Chandler.
neutral	Yeah, you should.

non-neutral	Come on Treeger, dont say that.
neutral	You just ahh, you just need more practice.
neutral	Here, come on, lets ahh, lets try it again.
neutral	Come on.
non-neutral	Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.
non-neutral	I mean, yknow, Im not really that comfortable dancing with a We-he!!
non-neutral	Hey!
non-neutral	: Yeah!
neutral	Oh, I
neutral	Are you sure? Ill bet theres another flight to Minsk in like
neutral	July. Umm,
non-neutral	Thats really beautiful. What does it mean?
neutral	Please, clean my beakers. I dont get out of the lab much.
non-neutral	Thats good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
neutral	Yeah, I Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldnt because yknow, Ihave to leave.
non-neutral	Youre right! Youre right. Dont say it.
non-neutral	I-I do though.
non-neutral	I do too.
neutral	Bye Phoebe.
non-neutral	Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
neutral	I know.
surprise	Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that?
non-neutral	Listen, Im gettin something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
neutral	No, I do not hear that.
joy	Yeah, I-I heard.  I think its great!  Ohh, Im so happy for you!
joy	Oh, well, thats great!
joy	Yeah! Yeah!
joy	I cant believe youre getting married!
neutral	Yeah.
neutral	Monica and Rachel made out.
surprise	Ohhh!
surprise	Why are we in bed together?
neutral	I dont know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
neutral	Yeah.
surprise	Really?!
neutral	No!
fear	But we-we didnt havesex-uh, did we?
neutral	I mean, I dont remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
joy	Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
neutral	And we didnt have sex.
neutral	Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. Im just glad we didnt do anything stupid.
neutral	Tell me about it.
neutral	What are we gonna do?
neutral	I say we go with
neutral	Chandler?
neutral	Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
non-neutral	Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
disgust	Whats that smell?
non-neutral	I know!

neutral	Um-hmm.
neutral	What am I making him by the way?
neutral	Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
surprise	I thought I was making him filet mignon?
neutral	Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.
non-neutral	And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
surprise	Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
non-neutral	Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!
non-neutral	Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated.
neutral	Yknow its like uh, Biology!
non-neutral	Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
neutral	Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.
non-neutral	Phoebe!
neutral	If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes probably not gay.
neutral	You are falling fast asleep.
neutral	Deeper.
neutral	Deeper.
neutral	Deeper.
neutral	You are now completely asleep.
neutral	You dont need to smoke.
neutral	Cigarettes dont control you.
neutral	You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
neutral	A strong, confident woman.
neutral	Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller.
joy	Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
neutral	Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
non-neutral	Of course not.
neutral	No.
neutral	Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
neutral	So how are things going with Paul?
joy	Good.
non-neutral	Although yknow, he-hes a private guy.
sadness	Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
neutral	Thats easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wont open.
surprise	So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
neutral	No thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
neutral	Hi honey.
joy	Hi!
fear	Okay, Ben, I wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident.
surprise	Monica, number one, I dont think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!
neutral	You said number two.
neutral	I also said number one.
neutral	Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
neutral	Cant I just look at the handles on them?
neutral	You would think.
neutral	Okay, fine.
non-neutral	Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why Im a terrible waitress?
neutral	Because, I dont care.
neutral	I dont care.
non-neutral	I dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I dont care where the tray spot is, I just dont care, this is not what I want to do.
non-neutral	So I dont think I should do it anymore.
non-neutral	Im gonna give you my weeks notice.
surprise	What?!
non-neutral	Gunther, I quit.
surprise	Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee?
non-neutral	Ohh, I mean its just so realistic!
neutral	I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.
joy	Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
neutral	Do you uh, do youready for a refill?
surprise	Oh, I probably shouldntso I will!  Oh! Wow! Its like its raining!
joy	Pretty cool, huh?
neutral	But if youre thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldnt get sucked up into the mechanism, well youd be wrong.
neutral	Umm, can I use your bathroom?
neutral	Its uh, right through there.
non-neutral	Okay.  God yknow, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbianis apartment
joy	Yeah, lifes pretty great isnt it?
joy	Yeah, it sure is!
neutral	You know, I think I was sixteen.
neutral	Please, just a little bit off the back.
neutral	I'm still on "no."
neutral	Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
anger	No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.
neutral	What's goin' on?
neutral	Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
non-neutral	What stupid thing did you do?
disgust	Ewww!
neutral	I know.
neutral	See, yes.
neutral	Thats Yasmine Bleeth, shes a completely different kind of chick.
neutral	I love you both.
neutral	But in very different ways.
surprise	Hey!
surprise	Hey!
neutral	(sees hes watching
non-neutral	I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
non-neutral	If they cant find a home for her, they kill her! And Im not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
non-neutral	Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
disgust	Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of other animals!
disgust	Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
joy	Thanks, Im glad you see it that way.
joy	Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
neutral	So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
non-neutral	Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
neutral	So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
neutral	Ohh, he's really shy. I-I dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
neutral	Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
non-neutral	I dont care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
surprise	Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?
neutral	I might've said that.  Why is that funny?
joy	Because I'm very happy for him!  And
non-neutral	Hi!
neutral	All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
neutral	Okay.
neutral	All right, let's go say good-bye.
neutral	Hey!
anger	Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?
disgust	Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
surprise	Fish!
neutral	It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
sadness	Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here
joy	Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
joy	We did have fun, didn't we?
joy	We did!
neutral	Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
joy	Oh, I would love to!
joy	Yay, okay!
joy	Good, good, good, good, good.
neutral	Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
neutral	Um...  Done!
surprise	Youre, hey, youre not paying for the pizza!
neutral	Oh come on, its only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
neutral	Ahh, Id throw another thousand on that.
neutral	Why, how much is that?
neutral	Thats about 60 cents.
neutral	Okay, its coffee.
surprise	Ice coffee? Tell me its ice coffee!
neutral	Its-its hot
surprise	Hot coffee!!!
anger	You idiot!!
anger	You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!
anger	What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?!
non-neutral	Huh?

neutral	Whats your favourite thing about summertime?
neutral	Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
neutral	Yeah
surprise	Hey!
joy	Tommyyyy! Say, whats your favourite thing about summer?

non-neutral	Ohh, thats a good one.
neutral	OK, try this salmon mousse.
joy	Mmmm. Good.
neutral	Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
non-neutral	It's creamier.
neutral	Yeah, well, is that
disgust	I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
surprise	My God! What happened to you?
disgust	Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?
non-neutral	"You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
joy	That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
non-neutral	Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really
non-neutral	Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
joy	Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
neutral	Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
neutral	I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
non-neutral	Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
neutral	Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
neutral	I don't see why not.
neutral	Here's my retainer!
neutral	Someone in there?
non-neutral	No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.
surprise	Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
neutral	Someone was in the lady's room, I couldnt wait. I left the lid up for ya though.

neutral	Someone in here.
anger	Im going to keep dating him Mother, and theres nothing you can do about it!
anger	Oh yes there is!
anger	What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
anger	That was an accident! And so were you.
anger	Well, at least Im not a murderer!
non-neutral	Oh, my baby!
surprise	That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
neutral	Oh, just years of experience.
non-neutral	Can I get some ice here?!
joy	Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
non-neutral	Youre not the fan whos dying are you?
surprise	Say what?
neutral	Im supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying, but thats not supposed to be until  later!
non-neutral	No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-Im the guy in the coma!
surprise	Oh that was a real person?!
non-neutral	An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
surprise	I-I-Im leaving the show?
neutral	I dont know. Why? Did you hear something?
surprise	Who told you that?
non-neutral	Oh uh, one of the writers.
surprise	Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
neutral	Umm
neutral	Feel better?
joy	Yeah!
joy	Much!
non-neutral	Listen uh, not that Im yknow insecure about my manhood or anything yknow, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
neutral	Yeah, I understand.
joy	Yeah! Okay!  Hey! Hi!
joy	Hi!
surprise	Yknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
neutral	I dont think so.

neutral	$4.50 please.
neutral	Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.

joy	There you go!
non-neutral	You're definitely scaring here.
neutral	Would you like to call somebody?
neutral	Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.

neutral	In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a
neutral	Phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, she doesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know that youve been living with your Grandmothers for a week now.
neutral	Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
neutral	Hey.
neutral	Hey.
sadness	Im never gonna find a roommate, ever.
neutral	Why, nobody good?
disgust	Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural.
disgust	The spitter.

neutral	Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing
neutral	So how many more do you have tomorrow?
neutral	Two.
neutral	This photographer, who seemed really dull.

non-neutral	No-no-no, no!
neutral	Well, how-how come?
neutral	Thats just the way it is.
surprise	Thats crazy.
neutral	Maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.
neutral	See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now Peter!
neutral	Hey, Peter!

neutral	Op.
non-neutral	Eh.
neutral	Oh, you got me.

neutral	No. But thanks.
sadness	Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
neutral	Okay. No. But thanks.
neutral	Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
surprise	Wow, that was kinda brutal.
neutral	Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.
neutral	Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, yknow.
neutral	Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,
neutral	Yeah, sure.
surprise	Wow.
neutral	I'm, I'm really sorry.
neutral	Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
surprise	Relieved?
neutral	Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
neutral	She wants

anger	Fine!
anger	But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  If you accept full responsibility...  Full responsibility!
anger	...I can begin to trust you again.
anger	Does that seem like something you can do.
anger	Does it?!
anger	!
surprise	No?
neutral	Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel.
neutral	If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
sadness	Yeah, I know.
sadness	I mean, no, youre right.
neutral	Yeah I guess Ill let it go.
sadness	But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
neutral	Sure, its hard to forget!
neutral	But that doesnt mean you have to talk about it!
neutral	A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.
surprise	What the hell happened on that beach?!
neutral	Its between us and the sea, Ross!
non-neutral	I didnt think you were gay. I do now.
neutral	See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
sadness	Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious.
neutral	Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
surprise	Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
neutral	Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
joy	Oh wow! Im free for her!

neutral	Hold on, yknow I
non-neutral	Oh well, thats uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!

neutral	Well, I dont really know what that is, but
neutral	Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
neutral	Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
