      "Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than    on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!\n",
      "OH!\n",
      "Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!\n",
      "I hate this woman!!\n",

      "Wow, what-what do you think she wants?\n",
      "Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.\n",
      "It?s possible. You are very loveable, I?d miss you if I broke up with you.  I was just trying to be supportive.\n",
      "Then be supportive like a guy.\n",
      "If I broke up with you, I?d miss you.\n",
      "Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.\n",
      "Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.\n",

      "Yeah, okay.\n",
      "Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica!  Oooh, I can't leave her!\n",
      "You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.\n",
      "That's not gonna work.\n",
      "I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.\n",
      "Hey! I didn't know either.\n",
      "Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?\n",
      "Yeah, I knew.\n",
      "Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.\n",
      "Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!\n",
      "Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.\n",
      "I'm not in charge of where the conference is held.\n",
      "Do you want people to think it's a fake conference?\n",
      "It's a real conference.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.\n",

      "Shhhhhhhhh!!!  I?m sorry, I thought maybe I?d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.\n",
      "With a wok?  I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.\n",
      "It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!\n",
      "Here, let me make the milk, I?m up anyway.\n",
      "Hey, y?know what we can do?\n",
      "Y?know, now that we are up?\n",
      "We can just like talk to each other all night long, y?know like we did when we were first going out.\n",
      "It?d be fun!\n",
      "Okay that does sound like fun.\n",
      "Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?\n",
      "The second sister dies?!\n",
      "No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.\n",

      "That?s correct.\n",
      "Look at it this way:\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "You're a lucky man.\n",
      "You know what I miss the most about her?\n",
      "That cute nibbly noise when she eats.\n",
      "Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.\n",
      "Huh, I never really noticed.\n",
      "Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.\n",
      "Monica, Monica is great.\n",
      "Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.\n",
      "You're shooting with Althea?!\n",
      "Althea is correct.\n",
      "Nice shooting!\n",
      "We?ll take Literature!!\n",
      "Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey?s apartment. What name appears on the address label?\n",
      "Chandler gets it! It?s Chandler Bing!\n",
      "No!!\n",
      "I?m afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.\n",
      "I knew that! Rachel! Use you?re head!\n",
      "Actually, it?s Miss Chinandolor Bong.\n",
      "Phoebe did the signs!\n",

      "Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.\n",
      "I cannot believe that you didn?t tell me that we are still married!!\n",
      "Look I was going to tell you!\n",
      "When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn?t get the annulment; we are still married.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "You?re kidding!\n",
      "Oh my God!!\n",
      "Ross!\n",
      "Okay, maybe it wasn?t my best decision. But I just couldn?t face another failed marriage.\n",
      "Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?\n",
      "Rach, come on, if you think about it, it?s actually kinda funny.  Okay, maybe it?s best not to think about it.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "Phoebe, I told her you already knew.\n",
      "Another lie. You have a sickness!\n",
      "Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you?re not married to anymore of us are ya?\n",
      "So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?\n",
      "Um-hmm.  There we go. There it is.\n",

      "Hang in there. You hang in there.\n",
      "Did you say something?\n",
      "No, just singing.\n",
      "Whenever you?re ready.\n",
      "Okay. Hey, Timmy, I?ve got a surprise for you.\n",
      "Hold it. I?m sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less?intense?\n",
      "Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.\n",
      "Umm, jealous!\n",
      "Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.\n",
      "Yeah, no problem.\n",
      "Ross!\n",

      "Ooh,\n",
      "Condoms?\n",
      "You don't know how long we're gonna be in here!\n",
      "And condoms are the way to do that?\n",
      "Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily\n",
      "Oh my God! My dog died!\n",
      "What?!\n",
      "Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!\n",
      "Le Poo's still alive?!\n",
      "Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh.  Oh my God.\n",
      "Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.\n",
      "It's Le Poo.\n",
      "I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.\n",
      "So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?\n",
      "I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.\n",
      "Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You know more than one Fun Bobby?\n",
      "I happen to know a Fun Bob.\n",

      "Not her.\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?\n",
      "Crematorium Chris? Sure!\n",
      "He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.\n",
      "Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!\n",
      "Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature!\n",
      "Not nature,\n",
      "This is fashion?!  Okay, so to you,\n",
      "I?m sorry you?re here with me instead of Roger.\n",
      "Yeah, me too.\n",
      "Well, I could make it seem like he?s here.\n",
      "Here?s some little known facts about cous-cous.\n",

      "But I should warn you, I am\n",
      "Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Hmm, let?s see if it comes up this time.\n",
      "Electrifying.  Emphatic time-time-time\n",

      "Oh no, I?m not playing tonight.\n",
      "Why not?\n",
      "I can?t follow Ross! It?d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed\n",
      "Phoebe, Ross sucks!\n",
      "Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.\n",
      "Oh my God, he?s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!\n",
      "Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.\n",
      "Yeah, Phoebe you?re? awful!\n",

      "Shut it down.\n",
      "Okay, I need a, I need a drink!\n",
      "Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff.\n",
      "But who cares?!\n",
      "Because it's all on me!\n",
      "That is, one big drink!\n",
      "Macadamia nut?\n",
      "Umm? Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!\n",
      "Hm-mmm!\n",

      "Well maybe he was just nervous, y?know you can be very intimidating.\n",
      "And besides I?ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.\n",
      "Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.\n",
      "But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?\n",
      "All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!\n",
      "That?s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.\n",

      "Imagine his consternation when? Oh bloody hell.\n",
      "Did she call?\n",
      "No, sorry.\n",
      "All right, maybe I should call her.\n",
      "No! Forget her, man! You don?t need her, you don?t need that!\n",
      "He?s right, what she did was unforgivable.\n",
      "Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?\n",
      "How might you be wrong?\n",
      "Well y'know, what if she didn?t actually sleep with the guy?\n",
      "Dude, tell me she actually told you this.\n",
      "She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!\n",
      "That?s all you?re basing this on?\n",
      "That?s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.\n",
      "Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There?s a lot of theories that didn?t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.\n",
      "Oh my God!!\n",
      "Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?\n",
      "Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?\n",
      "Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.\n",
      "What one?\n",
      "Yeah! Y?know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.\n",
      "Oh, isn?t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?\n",
      "Anyway, speaking of drinking too much.\n",
      "I was uh, tellin? Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Remember?! We?come on, we both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops\n",

      "we went back to the house and we got really silly and we?we made out.\n",
      "Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you?re talking about.\n",
      "Really?!\n",
      "Cassie?!\n",
      "Hey Ross!\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "It?s been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see\n",

      "Oh well, all right?um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.\n",

      "Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could?ve ever happened to you.\n",
      "I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway!\n",
      "And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now!\n",
      "I?m the only daughter dad is proud of!\n",
      "Okay, well this is, this is what you?re gonna do.\n",
      "You?re gonna get a job, you?re gonna get an apartment, and then I?ll help you and you can stay with us.\n",
      "Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?\n",
      "Of course, yeah!\n",
      "Oh, that?s so great! Okay, I?m really gonna do this! I don?t know how to thank you guys.\n",
      "Ooh, I like cards.\n",
      "I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!\n",
      "That can be arranged.\n",
      "Let?s reset.\n",
      "What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!\n",
      "Let?s take it from there.\n",
      "Are you a little off today? It?s going terribly slowly.\n",
      "Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour.\n",
      "Okay?\n",
      "And I?m the minister.\n",
      "Please!\n",
      "Please!\n",
      "Can you pull it together?\n",
      "Of course! I?m-I?m sorry. I-I?d hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!\n",
      "Thank you. Thank you.\n",
      "Still rolling, annnnd action!\n",
      "I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!\n",
      "Now, that can be arranged!  Slippery little bugger!\n",
      "Professor Geller?\n",
      "Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?\n",
      "I know I didn?t do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.\n",
      "And why exactly would I do that?\n",
      "Because I?m in love with you.\n",
      "What?!\n",
      "Yeah, I?m all?in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?\n",
      "No!\n",
      "Well why not? You changed Ned?s grade!\n",
      "Well that?s different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!\n",
      "No he?s not! He?s totally yanking your chain! He?s done this with three other teachers!\n",
      "What?\n",
      "He?s got a girlfriend!\n",
      "I can?t believe someone would do that for a grade.\n",
      "I know! It?s awful. I love you.\n",
      "This is Ross?\n",
      "Ross of.....\n",
      "Of Ross and Rachel.\n",
      "Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.\n",
      "Oh hey, hey Mark.\n",
      "Hey, hold on a second.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Hi honey!\n",
      "Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?\n",
      "Oh, he's just goofing around.\n",
      "Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?\n",
      "Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.\n",
      "Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?\n",
      "Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go.  Mark, I need you!\n",
      "Okay, bye-bye.\n",
      "Ow! Ross!!\n",
      "Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number.\n",
      "Hello Rachel.\n",
      "Get off.\n",
      "Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?\n",
      "Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?\n",
      "Oh, yeah!\n",
      "Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know?\n",
      "I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.\n",
      "Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.\n",
      "The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know?\n",
      "I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.\n",
      "Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian.\n",
      "Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.\n",
      "....Are we still talking about sex?\n",
      "You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.\n",
      "Maureen Rosilla.\n",
      "?Cause she doesn?t hate Yanni, is not a real reason.\n",
      "Hello, Mr. Heckles.\n",
      "You're doing it again.\n",
      "We're not doing anything.\n",
      "You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.\n",
      "You don't have birds.\n",
      "Man, I sure miss Julie.\n",
      "Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.\n",
      "You ever figure out what that thing's for?\n",
      "No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing.\n",
      "You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life.\n",
      "My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "I got a little drunk...and naked.\n",
      "Bob here.\n",
      "Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?\n",
      "I'm Monica.\n",
      "I need to talk to you, it's urgent!\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking.\n",
      "And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.\n",
      "Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!\n",
      "Monica\n",
      "No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!\n",
      "Will you marry me?\n",
      "No, go ahead.\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh???.\n",
      "Hey, my favorite part is coming up!\n",
      "'Kay!\n",
      "Oh my God!\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.\n",
      "Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?\n",
      "Uhh, well, she's?really good in bed.\n",
      "Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!\n",
      "Well look, hey, it's all your fault!\n",
      "What?! Why?!\n",
      "Well because you didn't give me advice!\n",
      "No!\n",
      "You gave me a pickup line!\n",
      "As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first.\n",
      "I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!\n",
      "And her roommate!\n",
      "What about the closeness?\n",
      "Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!\n",
      "Oh! Hi!\n",
      "Hi!\n",
      "Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.\n",
      "Oh, hello.  Hello.\n",
      "Soul mate.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Soul mate.\n",
      "So, what have you guys been doing?\n",
      "Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?\n",
      "I know! What is this, 1985?!\n",
      "That?s exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn?t that strange.\n",
      "Yes, when I first met you, you were like, Blah, blah, blah. I was like, shhh!\n",
      "What is it that I do?\n",
      "Well it?s just like you?re trying too hard. Always making jokes, y?know, you just?You come off a little needy.\n",
      "Did you like me when we first met?\n",
      "Chandler, I?m not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you.\n",
      "Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I?m not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.\n",
      "I can?t! My circuits are fried! They?re fried I tell you!!\n",
      "Wow!  Well then I?ll just have to carry you.\n",
      "That?ll be a neat trick, when you?re,  when you?re dead!\n",
      "Ross, you don?t have to yell.\n",
      "There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.\n",
      "What else?\n",
      "Here you go.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Oh wow!\n",
      "What are you doing?\n",
      "Oh, sorry.\n",
      "What you?don?t hold it like that! You?re lettin? all the good stuff fall out.\n",
      "Oh whoops.\n",
      "Careful! You?re wasting good pastrami!  Oh my God! I?m\n",
      "So uh, have a great time down there.\n",
      "I will.\n",
      "Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh?\n",
      "Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it?s revealing which I?m fine with, no I?m concerned about your health, sun exposure.\n",
      "Oh, don?t worry I have plenty of sun block, it?s SPF-30.\n",
      "Well, if what?s in the bottle is actually 30.\n",
      "I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it?s-it?s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it?s just milk.\n",
      "Ross, it?s going to be okay.\n",
      "I?m not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys.\n",
      "I really like you.\n",
      "I like how things are going between us.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Yeah! I?m just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.\n",
      "Okay. Cool.\n",
      "Oh hey! Here they are!\n",
      "Call me!\n",
      "Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!\n",
      "Come on, let?s have some fun. Huh?  What do you want to do today?\n",
      "Nothing. I don?t want to do anything.\n",
      "Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.\n",
      "Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!\n",
      "How hot do I look in this, huh?!\n",
      "Ross, a sports car? Wouldn?t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?\n",
      "That?s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have\n",
      "Hey, what?s the horsepower on this thing?\n",
      "I don?t know, but-but look how shiny!\n",
      "I can?t believe you bought this.\n",
      "Really! God Ross, what were you thinking?  I know it?s really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.\n",
      "Oh, well get in line missy.  So, can I have a ride stud?\n",
      "Hop in.  Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.\n",
      "Damnit!\n",
      "Okay, who?s next?\n",
      "I can?t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger?s gonna be living in\n",
      "Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it?s time the velvet ropes came down.\n",
      "They kept your room for a while.\n",
      "Yeah, your roommate is a soap opera star.\n",
      "Look, y?know I know my life?s going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who?ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they?re thirty.\n",
      "Yeah, but you shouldn?t compare yourself to me.\n",
      "Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!\n",
      "There you go!\n",
      "I did it!\n",
      "One mile on a hippity-hop!\n",
      "That?s it!!\n",
      "That?s everything I wanted to do before I was thirty.\n",
      "Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister.\n",
      "But oh well.\n",
      "Yay!!\n",
      "And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.\n",
      "So, tonight?s the night of the big bachelor party?\n",
      "Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl?s number.\n",
      "No problem. So who?s the party for?\n",
      "My husband.\n",
      "You hired your husband a hooker?\n",
      "She?s a stripper.\n",
      "No, she?s a hooker.\n",
      "Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?\n",
      "When they?re hookers.\n",
      "It was awful.\n",
      "To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up.\n",
      "So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn?t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!\n",
      "Come here. I can breath through my mouth.\n",
      "Y?know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like\n",
      "I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?\n",
      "Ooh, I don?t know if we?re there yet.\n",
      "Well, you certainly own that room.\n",
      "Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Oh my God!\n",
      "Oh my God!!\n",
      "Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!!\n",
      "In my apartment!!\n",
      "I am such a huge fan!\n",
      "I am such a huge fan!\n",
      "Well, it?s nice to know that you\n",
      "That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.\n",
      "Oh that explains all the women?s underwear.\n",
      "Right there! That's my car!  Hey!!\n",
      "Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?\n",
      "I can't believe this!\n",
      "Wait, we still have time to talk and they?re-they're not even in the car yet!  Oh look, there they go, okay.\n",
      "Yes that was a nice place!\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "What are we gonna do?\n",
      "I don't know. Maybe pizza?\n",
      "About Ross!\n",
      "Oh! Oh!\n",
      "Hello!\n",
      "Oh yeah!\n",
      "It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references.\n",
      "Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet!\n",
      "Yeah, he's very reliable.\n",
      "Of course he has this big huge dog!\n",
      "That uh, barks into the night.\n",
      "Well, who doesn't love dogs?\n",
      "Ah, he's a tap dancer!\n",
      "Yes, some would say that\n",
      "Ohhhhh!\n",
      "Hey, will you grab me a cruller?  Sit down! Will you\n",
      "Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it?s getting darker and more painful, that means it?s healing.\n",
      "I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let?s just get that thing?pushed back in.\n",
      "Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don?t want that hanging over my head.\n",
      "Okay?\n",
      "Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want!\n",
      "Yeah, I?m thinking I?ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "What?s going on?\n",
      "Oh Joey?s got a really bad hernia, but that?s nothing a little laser eye surgery won?t fix!\n",
      "Look, I?m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here (He puts his hand down his pants, like Al Bundy on\n",
      "Hey! Maybe you?ll die!\n",
      "Are you thinking about Monica?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, what's that like?\n",
      "Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?\n",
      "Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.\n",
      "I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.\n",
      "Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a\n",
      "Before or after you were shot by your own troops?\n",
      "I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.\n",
      "Was I talking to her about gas?\n",
      "More so than anything else.\n",
      "I-I-I found it interesting.\n",
      "I'm sorry.\n",
      "Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.\n",
      "Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.\n",
      "Ross?\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "What else do they add smell too?\n",
      "Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!\n",
      "Joey's not going.\n",
      "I didn't finish my five pages.\n",
      "Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?\n",
      "Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.\n",
      "Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.\n",
      "Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.\n",
      "I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.\n",
      "Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.\n",
      "The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored.\n",
      "Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.\n",
      "I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!\n",
      "Come on look guys, don't fight.\n",
      "And the reason I'm doing this is because\n",
      "Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?\n",
      "If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.\n",
      "Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!\n",
      "How about we settle this right now!  There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!\n",
      "I paid for those tickets!\n",
      "Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.\n",
      "No, I?m leaving to get my hair dyed.\n",
      "Really?!\n",
      "I like your natural color.\n",
      "Come on man, it?s a great part.\n",
      "Look, check it out.\n",
      "I?m the lead guy?s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat.\n",
      "Listen-listen.\n",
      "?I?m sorry, that seat?s saved.?\n",
      "That?s the whole part?\n",
      "Okay, I?ll see you in an hour.\n",
      "Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ?I?m sorry, that seat is taken.?\n",
      "Oh, excuse me.\n",
      "No, no, I didn?t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?\n",
      "I believed you were saving this seat for someone.\n",
      "So, you?d hire me, right?\n",
      "For what?\n",
      "Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.\n",
      "Yeah, it?s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It?s a very important issue in this month?s\n",
      "Y?know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and\n",
      "And in\n",
      "You have no trouble telling time now right?\n",
      "No!\n",
      "Quick! What time is it?!\n",
      "I don?t know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?!  What are you laughing at\n",
      "Y?know when I said that because we?re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "Yeah that was stupid. Let?s not do that.\n",
      "Ohh, absolutely.\n",
      "And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.\n",
      "Yeah, definitely!\n",
      "Okay,  if you?ll excuse me, I-I?m gonna go hang out with some people who don?t know the\n",
      "Then, I?d steer clear of Phoebe.\n",
      "Man!\n",
      "Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn?t hang out with?all the guys in my office.\n",
      "Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?\n",
      "I wouldn't read too much into it.\n",
      "Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?\n",
      "David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going.\n",
      "I'm not very good at giving advice.\n",
      "So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.\n",
      "Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...\n",
      "Seriously, we're gonna do this?\n",
      "I'm sorry, uh...\n",
      "I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?\n",
      "Oh, because his penis was too big.  Oh, I'm sorry,\n",
      "That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!\n",
      "What?\n",
      "And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.\n",
      "Is that a hint?\n",
      "Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!\n",
      "Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!\n",
      "Mrs. Geller?\n",
      "She looks so small.\n",
      "I know.\n",

      "And I noticed there aren?t any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first?  There\n",
      "Kinda.\n",
      "Right. So I guess I shouldn?t put good at noticing stuff on my resume.\n",
      "Oh-ohh, thank you.\n",
      "Anyway, I?m guessing you hired somebody.\n",
      "Well\n",
      "Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.\n",

      "What?\n",
      "Yeah! You-you got the job! You?re my new assistant!\n",
      "I am?!\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "I can?t believe it!\n",
      "Me either.\n",
      "Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.\n",
      "Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of\n",
      "Come on, you know they love you.\n",
      "As much as they love you?\n",
      "I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It?s not my fault.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Ugh, I hate this year!\n",
      "What?s wrong with this year?\n",
      "Well okay, it?s already February and I?ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!\n",
      "That was me and Ross.\n",
      "Oh that?s right!\n",
      "Hey, y?know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.\n",
      "Oh that?s a great idea. You?re really good on the phone.\n",
      "Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had.\n",
      "Y?know, I probably wouldn?t have to say spank as much.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Oh yeah, like you never called!\n",
      "Oh, Joey! Sorry!\n",
      "I can?t believe this Chandler!\n",
      "Sorry! I-I-I don?t know what to say.\n",
      "Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!\n",
      "Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!\n",
      "Oh, well I?m uh\n",
      "Y?know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!\n",
      "Oh wow! Okay man, I?m sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.\n",
      "Well that?s good. Because you didn?t! And I?m incredibly happy for ya!!\n",
      "That?s mean! You really had me going there!\n",
      "Oh, we could do this all day.\n",
      "Yeah, you?re right. Okay look, listen, let?s talk about what a huge star I?m gonna be!\n",
      "You\n",
      "You hug me!\n",
      "All right!\n",
      "Hey, do we do this too much?\n",
      "I think so. Yeah, get off me.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Where are they?\n",
      "...spender.\n",
      "She's still asleep.\n",
      "So how'd it go?\n",
      "Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?\n",
      "The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.\n",
      "Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great.\n",
      "So I had to do all this other stuff.\n",
      "And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!\n",
      "Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.\n",
      "It was amazing!\n",
      "And not just for her... uh-uh.\n",
      "For me, too.\n",
      "It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind.\n",
      "But all my other senses are heightened, y'know?\n",
      "It's like...\n",
      "I was able to appreciate it on another level.\n",
      "I didn't know you had another level.\n",
      "I know! Neither did I!\n",
      "Morning!\n",
      "Oh right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Oh God. Oh I can?t believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!\n",
      "Well he actually saw you a little bit too.\n",
      "Noo! Oh God we did?we didn?t, we didn?t uhh\n",
      "No! No! No, not after seeing that.\n",
      "God I?m just a horrible person.\n",
      "Wh-why?\n",
      "Because I?m married. That?s right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star?s apartment to have an affair! Uck!\n",
      "That?s ridiculous! I?m not a Star, just a regular famous actor.\n",
      "Ohh, impressive.\n",
      "Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.\n",
      "Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.\n",
      "Okay.  So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?\n",
      "All right, I can't wait!\n",
      "Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.\n",
      "He\n",
      "Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.\n",
      "That's so sweet.\n",
      "Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you.\n",
      "It's fine!\n",
      "We don't have to move in together.\n",
      "I just?I want you to be happy\n",
      "Living with you would make me happy.\n",
      "Phoebe, you\n",
      "No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!\n",
      "Are you sure?\n",
      "Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!\n",
      "Oh that's great!\n",
      "Oh wait, one sec.\n",
      "One sec.\n",
      "Hey you!\n",
      "Behind the glass!\n",
      "Who are you looking at!\n",
      "I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms,  which was never!\n",
      "All right Ross you?re in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?\n",
      "The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I?ll take another question.\n",
      "Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.\n",
      "It?s okay, I?m ready.\n",
      "No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you?re ready to answer the question.\n",
      "This is ridiculous, he?s not gonna hold his breath\n",
      "Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris?Holy cow, that?s a big word.\n",
      "Trisc? Seriously look at this thing.\n",
      "Chandler, how do you say that?\n",
      "N-no! Okay? We?ve been through this! We?re not gonna get married just because she?s pregnant, okay?\n",
      "Honestly! Ross, this isn?t just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped. A child should have a family.\n",
      "Mom, y?know what? I-I can?t deal with this right now. I?m sorry\n",
      "Just?think about it. If you don?t, I?ll talk more about humping.\n",
      "Gimmie!\n",
      "Hi!\n",
      "Oh hi dear!\n",
      "Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!\n",
      "This one?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.\n",
      "You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.\n",
      "You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.\n",
      "Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.\n",
      "Wait! We need shoes!\n",
      "Okay. Um, how about these?\n",
      "That's really a day shoe.\n",
      "And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?\n",
      "Could we see something in a slimmer heel?\n",
      "Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.\n",
      "No, it really should be burgundy.\n",
      "Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?\n",
      "No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.\n",
      "Oh my God..\n",
      "Is everything all right, dear?\n",
      "Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.\n",
      "Joey, you?re such an amazing actor!  How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?\n",
      "Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.\n",
      "So?\n",
      "I feel really sad that we're not?really there anymore.\n",
      "Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?\n",
      "Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?\n",
      "Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before.\n",
      "Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible.\n",
      "And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.\n",
      "That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.\n",
      "Did not.\n",
      "Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!\n",
      "Okay, I freaked out a little.\n",
      "Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places!\n",
      "It?s my joke.\n",
      "It?s my joke.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel? Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!\n",
      "Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody?s stairs!\n",
      "Ross, it?s not that big a deal! So you?ll been divorced three times, you?ll still have a life, you?ll go on dates\n",
      "No!\n",
      "No, I won?t!\n",
      "I?ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now.\n",
      "The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.\n",
      "Ross, you?re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is\n",
      "Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?\n",
      "Y?know that?s really fair.\n",
      "Y?know?\n",
      "Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60.\n",
      "Ross, nobody cares about this except you!\n",
      "This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head!\n",
      "Here, I?ll show you!\n",
      "Come here.\n",
      "What?! Why?\n",
      "Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn?t you date him?\n",
      "And if you wait right here, I?ll go get Ross.\n",
      "Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here.\n",
      "Why did I 'woo-hoo'?\n",
      "I mean, what was I hoping would happen?\n",
      "That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?\n",
      "I just wish there was something we could do.\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "Hello, Coma Guy.\n",
      "GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT!\n",
      "UP!\n",
      "UP!\n",
      "UP!\n",
      "Phoebe, what are you doing?\n",
      "Maybe nobody's tried this.\n",
      "I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face.\n",
      "I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart.\n",
      "I bet he's a lawyer.\n",
      "Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.\n",
      "Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.\n",
      "I wish all guys could be like him.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "You don?t understand!\n",
      "Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her!\n",
      "Is that taking it slow?!\n",
      "No, I?m not ready for this!\n",
      "Okay?\n",
      "What-what do I tell her?\n",
      "Just tell her the truth! Tell her you?re not ready.\n",
      "I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?\n",
      "Then you distract her with a\n",
      "Or! You can just, y?know\n",
      "What the hell are you doing?\n",
      "What? What the hell am\n",
      "What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!\n",
      "Oh-ho-ho, you think I don?t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me!  Well what do you know! Broken! That?ll be $400!\n",
      "Joey, I\n",
      "You pushed him!\n",
      "Joey, I did not break this! Okay?\n",
      "All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I still haven?t gotten a check for your half yet.\n",
      "Do\n",
      "I?m not talking to you! You broke my fridge!\n",
      "You broke a little girl?s leg?!!\n",
      "I know. I feel horrible. Okay.\n",
      "Says here that a muppet got whacked on\n",
      "Well, I?m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she?ll like?\n",
      "Maybe a\n",
      "I?m gonna get back to retraining.\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Six dollars, please.\n",
      "Six? I just had it for one night. It?s three.\n",
      "Eight o?clock is the cut-off and,  aww, it?s 8:02.\n",
      "Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you?re gonna have to help me out here, ?cause I only have three.\n",
      "I can help with that.\n",
      "Oh my God. Richard?  Hi!\n",
      "Hi!\n",
      "Wow! Your lip went bald.  Hey, thanks.\n",
      "So, you look great.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "No you do. You... just...\n",
      "What?\n",
      "You?ve got panties stuck to your leg.\n",
      "That?s because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it?s static cling.\n",
      "Or maybe it?s just that God knew I?d be running into you and saw an opportunity.\n",
      "It?s good to see you.\n",
      "It?s good to see you too.\n",
      "I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys.\n",
      "I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.\n",
      "I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.\n",
      "It's a beautiful thing.\n",
      "What's this?\n",
      "Which goes where?\n",
      "Saltines?\n",
      "No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?\n",
      "What?  Oh my God, there's really money in here.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "Weird Girl, what are you doing?\n",
      "No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.\n",
      "No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.\n",
      "Oh, that's fine, no.\n",
      "Would you like my tin-foil hat?\n",
      "No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.\n",
      "Please, let me do something.\n",
      "Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Ah Monica, my star student.\n",
      "Y?know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil.\n",
      "Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star.\n",
      "Oh, yum-yum-yum.\n",
      "Wow! A star!  I know you all hate me and-and I?m sorry, but I don?t care.\n",
      "Okay Joey, you?re up next.  This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!\n",
      "I can an A? In-in school?  Hey, I?m a dork.\n",
      "Joey! I?m so proud of you!\n",
      "I think you should give him your star.\n",
      "Excuse me? He doesn?t even know what he?s doing!\n",
      "We?re all beginners here. Nobody knows what they?re doing.\n",
      "I do! I?m a professional chef!  Oh relax! It?s not a courtroom drama!\n",
      "If you?re a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "I?m-I?m sorry, it?s just that umm? Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro?s, and umm I just got a really bad review\n",
      "Ha! My point!\n",
      "Oh, no!\n",
      "I don't think so!\n",
      "You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.\n",
      "He was a lawyer!\n",
      "You said\n",
      "Well, she cornered me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!\n",
      "Lie!!!\n",
      "How hard is that?!\n",

      "I can?t wait to read your book, Ross!\n",
      "!\n",
      "Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won?t be so bad.\n",
      "What do you think, she?s just gonna sit there quietly?\n",
      "You don?t think she?s gonna want to make a toast?\n",
      "You don?t think she?s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing\n",
      "Oh my God, she?s not gonna like the chicken that night either, is she?!\n",
      "Y?know what? It?s gonna be okay. Y?know what? She?s probably not gonna even want to come.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "No! That was a\n",
      "So-so you would?ve just lied?\n",
      "Yes!!\n",
      "Would it really have been that easy?\n",
      "Yes!!!\n",
      "Good, so do it Saturday night because we?re going to dinner with her and Clark.\n",
      "Yeah, we haven't dropped it in\n",
      "2 hours, 27 minutes.\n",

      "Yeah?\n",
      "You have scratches all over you, what happened?\n",
      "Well, it's my cat.\n",
      "What?!\n",
      "Oh yeah, I got a cat.\n",
      "I don't want a cat!\n",
      "Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You guys this cat is\n",
      "Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.\n",
      "What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!\n",
      "Well, I was gonna let you play with it.\n",
      "All right, y?know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?\n",
      "We don?t know what could make this go away.\n",
      "Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!\n",
      "And no one touches the\n",
      "Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?\n",
      "Well at least, I?m going to mute it.\n",
      "What is it hon?\n",
      "I-I can?t find anything that I want to eat!\n",
      "Everything I eat makes me nauseous!\n",
      "I?m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake?ooh!\n",
      "Cake!\n",

      "Oh, that?s right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that?s gotta be embarrassing!\n",
      "Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, ?Look how much money we?ve got!? Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations!\n",
      "You-you could have like little money place settings.\n",
      "And ah, you could start with a money salad!\n",
      "I mean it?ll be dry, but people\n",
      "Would you stop? We?ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don?t even know if he?s gonna propose.\n",
      "Yes, but this is Pete.\n",
      "Okay?\n",
      "He?s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome.\n",
      "For most guys that?s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.\n",

      "Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know?\n",
      "But, it?s just Jason?s so sensitive, y'know?\n",
      "And in the long run, I think sensitive it?s just better than having just like a really, really, really nice  butt.\n",
      "Jason!\n",
      "Definitely Jason!\n",
      "Okay, wish me luck!\n",
      "Good luck!\n",

      "So you talked to your dad, huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.\n",
      "So Joey, you okay?\n",
      "Yeah, I guess.\n",
      "It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go.\n",
      "Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.\n",
      "Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.\n",
      "If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or...\n",
      "I'll end up like my mom.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Hey, Pheebs.\n",
      "How's it going?\n",
      "Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.\n",
      "Awww.\n",
      "Yeah, right.\n",
      "Aaawwwwww!!\n",
      "What happened?\n",
      "I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just...\n",
      "I hate that guy!\n",
      "so I?ve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.\n",
      "Cheese you say? That?s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?\n",
      "Excuse me?\n",
      "Cheese, it?s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.\n",
      "Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I?m one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.\n",
      "Me too! Yeah, Chandler can?t stand it. He won?t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.\n",
      "And you?re still married to him?\n",
      "You know what I?d love to do?\n",
      "I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese?Not even bread, just cheese.\n",
      "No, I want the bread.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Ah, and pastries?  And pate.\n",
      "Oh, I?m really not high, it?s just I used to be fat.\n",
      "Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I?ve got a great little villa you can stay at.\n",
      "Is it made of cheese?\n",
      "No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn?t that be incredible?!\n",
      "I?d move in tomorrow!\n",
      "Oh come on!  Are you listening to this?\n",
      "I?m so sorry.\n",
      "What do we do?\n",
      "I don?t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don?t know how you fight that.\n",
      "Hey! Terry.\n",
      "Joey Tribbiani! I?m surprised your big head could fit through our small halls!  I gotta go Joey.\n",
