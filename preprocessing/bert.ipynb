      "non-neutral\tOh yes, well theres the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!\n",
      "neutral\tYes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.\n",
      "neutral\tYes, I realize that\n",
      "neutral\tAnd Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.\n",

      "non-neutral\tOkay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!\n",
      "neutral\tWell umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.\n",
      "neutral\tLike hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine\n",
      "joy\tYes!!! Oh!!\n",
      "non-neutral\tHypothetically!\n",
      "neutral\tStill.\n",
      "neutral\tIf Phoebe were my maid of honor\n",
      "neutral\tUh-hmm.\n",
      "neutral\tRachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.\n",

      "neutral\tIf you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?\n",
      "neutral\tIt's not just the drum noise.\n",
      "non-neutral\tEvery five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, \"Oh my eye!\n",
      "non-neutral\tOh god, my eye!\"\n",
      "non-neutral\tI mean, it is so annoying.\n",
      "neutral\tYes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.\n",
      "surprise\tPhoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?\n",
      "neutral\tMaybe on some level.\n",
      "surprise\tJoey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?\n",
